Following Luke's <a href="/wiki/Exile" class="mw-redirect mw-disambig" title="Exile">disappearance</a>, R2 entered a self-imposed low power mode as newer droid models started to out-compute the aging astromech. Despite this, his celebrated role in the Rebellion protected him from the usual recycling procedure of many old droids, allowing him a semi-retirement in the <a href="/wiki/Resistance" title="Resistance">Resistance</a> as he pored over several decades of uninterrupted data, and "dreamed" of his greatest adventures.
</p><p>Following his reawakening after the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Starkiller_Base" title="Battle of Starkiller Base">Battle of Starkiller Base</a>, R2 went on to accompany the <a href="/wiki/Force-sensitive" title="Force-sensitive">Force-sensitive</a> <a href="/wiki/Scavenger" title="Scavenger">scavenger</a> <a href="/wiki/Rey_Skywalker" title="Rey Skywalker">Rey</a> on her journey to train under Luke Skywalker on <a href="/wiki/Ahch-To" title="Ahch-To">Ahch-To</a>, the planet of the <a href="/wiki/First_Jedi_Temple" title="First Jedi Temple">First Jedi Temple</a>, where the droid was reunited with his old master. R2-D2 continued to aid the Resistance alongside his longtime counterpart C-3PO throughout the <a href="/wiki/First_Order-Resistance_War" title="First Order-Resistance War">First Order-Resistance War</a>, culminating in a decisive victory at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Exegol" title="Battle of Exegol">Battle of Exegol</a>, in which he was an active participant in the role of copilot for <a href="/wiki/General" title="General">General</a> <a href="/wiki/Poe_Dameron" title="Poe Dameron">Poe Dameron</a>.

<p>Following R2-D2 and Skywalker's adventures with Cad Bane, the two visited Senator Amidala on Coruscant. The Senator and C-3PO were organizing a party for Senator <a href="/wiki/Aang" title="Aang">Aang</a>, a friend of Amidala. After R2-D2 forgot to buy some <a href="/wiki/Jogan_fruit" title="Jogan fruit">jogan fruit</a> for garnishing the <a href="/wiki/Jogan_fruitcake" title="Jogan fruitcake">jogan fruitcake</a>, Skywalker sent Artoo and Threepio to the <a href="/wiki/Lower_market_districts" title="Lower market districts">lower market districts</a>.

<p>R2-D2 was again reunited with his protocol droid counterpart when the two droids took part in a Republic mercy mission to the <a href="/wiki/Mid_Rim_Territories" title="Mid Rim Territories">Mid Rim</a> planet of <a href="/wiki/Aleen" title="Aleen">Aleen</a>, which was experiencing a series of catastrophic global earthquakes. While R2-D2 was tasked with interfacing with the equipment, C-3PO served as a translator between the locals and the Clone Commander <a href="/wiki/Wolffe" title="Wolffe">Wolffe</a>. During their mission, R2-D2 and C-3PO visited a local Republic communications mission to survey and repair the damage caused by the recent earthquake. Upon arriving there, the native <a href="/wiki/Aleena" title="Aleena">Aleena</a> villages led the two droids into a collapsed structure, which contained a huge golden seal embedded into the ground. The seal turned out to be the entrance to a tunnel that led to the subterranean regions of Aleen. Their arrival coincided with an earthquake and the two droids fell into the tunnel and were separated from the clone troopers and villagers.<sup id="cite_ref-Mercy_Mission_55-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Mercy_Mission-55"><span class="cite-bracket">&#91;</span>55<span class="cite-bracket">&#93;</span></a></sup>
</p><p>While exploring the underground tunnels, R2-D2 and C-3PO encountered a species of sentient, <a href="/wiki/Tree" title="Tree">tree</a>-like beings called the <a href="/wiki/Kindalo" title="Kindalo">Kindalo</a>, who demanded that they leave since the surface dwellers "destroyed the peace." After C-3PO managed to convince the Kindalo that they bore no ill will and had come to help with the earthquakes, the Kindalo sent the two droids to meet <a href="/wiki/Orphne" title="Orphne">Orphne</a>, a reptilian humanoid with mystical powers. Orphne told the two droids that a mutual balance had previously existed between the Aleena and the subterranean world. Since Aleena's atmosphere was toxic to them, the underground dwellers depended on a filtering process of the planet's soil that made the air breathable for them. The underground dwellers had set off this earthquake as a means of sealing the breach.<sup id="cite_ref-Mercy_Mission_55-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Mercy_Mission-55"><span class="cite-bracket">&#91;</span>55<span class="cite-bracket">&#93;</span></a></sup>
</p><p>When C-3PO agreed to help fix the damage, Orphne gave the droids a parting riddle. R2-D2 quickly deduced that Orphne was referring to a river and used the water seal to activate a water spout that sent the two droids and the chamber's central floor plate back to the surface. The two droids landed at the opening where they were greeted by a chanting crowd of Aleena. Recalling the riddle, two droids quickly realized that they had to fix the breach, which was in fact the unsettled seal. Together, R2-D2 and C-3PO closed the seal which brought an end to Aleen's earthquakes.

After seeing Ahsoka in bonds, R2-D2 convinced the newly-repaired Death Watch droids to help him rescue her. Before the Death Watch leader Pre Vizsla could execute her, R2-D2 managed to blind Vizsla and return her lightsabers. While Tano parried with Vizsla, R2-D2's droid companions kept the remaining Death Watch members busy. This diversion enabled R2-D2 to escape with Ahsoka and Lux on a speeder.

<p>When Chancellor Palpatine was captured by General Grievous, R2-D2 accompanied Skywalker on the rescue mission. While Skywalker and Kenobi searched the Separatist flagship, the <i><a href="/wiki/Invisible_Hand" title="Invisible Hand">Invisible Hand</a></i>, for the Chancellor, R2-D2 encountered some super battle droids and succeeded in destroying them by spraying oil onto the ground and then igniting it. He then penetrated the Separatist flagship and managed to reunite with Skywalker, Kenobi, and Palpatine. Skywalker had freed the Chancellor and killed Count Dooku. Shortly later, they were captured by General Grievous' droids and taken to the command bridge. Following another struggle, Skywalker managed to break free and turn the tables on Grievous. Defeated, Grievous fled in an escape pod. Hit by Republic fire, the <i>Invisible Hand</i> began descending into Coruscant, with the Jedi and chancellor in it.

<p>Believing they were hostile, Tano knocked Tage and Tamsin unconscious. While making her way through the ship's engine room to reach the cockpit, Ahsoka encountered R2-D2 and hugged the astromech droid, having missed his company. Since he had not received a memory wipe, R2-D2 recognized his old friend and told her that he and the pilots were working for a senator who wanted to meet her. At Tano's prompting, R2-D2 told Ahsoka that Bail Organa was the senator. Tano managed to convince R2-D2 to release the tractor beam from her freighter, tell nobody he had met her, and to make sure that she could track his ship. Tano then waited in her ship in a nearby asteroid field until Senator Organa arrived in the <i>Tantive IV</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-Ahsoka_24-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Ahsoka-24"><span class="cite-bracket">&#91;</span>24<span class="cite-bracket">&#93;</span></a></sup>
</p><p>When Tage and Tamsin awoke, R2-D2 pretended to have been short-circuited by Tano in order to cover up his role in helping her escape. However, Bail realized R2-D2's role in Tano's escape after viewing a clip of the security footage in the engine room. After delivering his report, Tage rendezvoused with the <i>Tantive IV</i> and returned R2-D2 to his master. R2-D2 was greeted by C-3PO, who berated his companion. When Senator Organa arrived, R2-D2 informed her and left a hatch on the <i>Tantive IV</i> open. Ahsoka managed to infiltrate the ship with a pressure suit and entered Organa's office.<sup id="cite_ref-Ahsoka_24-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Ahsoka-24"><span class="cite-bracket">&#91;</span>24<span class="cite-bracket">&#93;</span></a></sup>
</p><p>After Ahsoka informed him about R2-D2's role in her escape, Organa joked that the droid was too independent and ought to be deactivated. Ahsoka responded that R2-D2 had had a lot of "bad role models." When Organa mentioned Anakin Skywalker, Ahsoka clarified she was referring to the late Senator Amidala. After Tano agreed to take part in a <a href="/wiki/Raada_Uprising" title="Raada Uprising">mission</a> on Raada to investigate the <a href="/wiki/Inquisitorius" title="Inquisitorius">Inquisitor</a> known as the <a href="/wiki/Sixth_Brother" title="Sixth Brother">Sixth Brother</a>, R2-D2 helped Captain Antilles' crew in repairing her damaged freighter. While R2-D2 was repairing the engines, Ahsoka spent time with him and told him that she missed him. When the engines hummed to life, Ahsoka thanked the astromech droid. Following the successful evacuation of the farming population on Raada, Ahsoka joined Senator Organa's <a href="/wiki/Bail_Organa%27s_resistance_movement" title="Bail Organa&#39;s resistance movement">rebel movement</a> and became the elusive spymaster known as "<a href="/wiki/Fulcrum" title="Fulcrum">Fulcrum</a>."<sup id="cite_ref-Ahsoka_24-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Ahsoka-24"><span class="cite-bracket">&#91;</span>24<span class="cite-bracket">&#93;</span></a></sup>

Since Tua could not speak the <a href="/wiki/Aqualish_(language)" title="Aqualish (language)">Aqualish language</a>, C-3PO was assigned the job of acting as her translator. However, R2-D2 was aware about the true nature of their mission: preventing the T-7 ion disruptors from falling into Imperial hands. By contrast, C-3PO was deliberately kept in the dark.<sup id="cite_ref-Droids_in_Distress_25-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Droids_in_Distress-25"><span class="cite-bracket">&#91;</span>25<span class="cite-bracket">&#93;</span></a></sup>

</p><p>While traveling to Bay 7, R2-D2 was accosted by Chopper, who had been sent to distract the Imperials. Chopper rammed himself into R2-D2, then shook his arm in apparent anger.

But then, Minister Tua recognized Chopper from the shuttle ride to Garel and ordered her stormtrooper guards to hurry to Bay 7.

</p><p>The Spectres then traveled back to Lothal to sell the stolen weapons and the two stowaway droids to Vizago at a pre-arranged rendezvous point. Before they could complete the transaction, Imperial forces under the ISB Agent <a href="/wiki/Alexsandr_Kallus" title="Alexsandr Kallus">Kallus</a> caught up with them. Unbeknownst to Chopper and the other crew, C-3PO had contacted the Imperial authorities telling them that he and his astromech counterpart had been kidnapped by a group of "criminals" in Garel. Carrying out Organa's orders, R2-D2 proceeded to overload and destroy the T-7 disruptors with the help of Sabine and Chopper. During the fighting, the rebels managed to destroy the T-7 disruptors and to escape their Imperial pursuers. Following their escape, the crew of the <i>Ghost</i> rendezvoused with Senator Bail Organa and returned R2-D2 and C-3PO to their rightful owner. In return for destroying the T-7 disruptors, Senator Organa paid the Spectres several <a href="/wiki/Galactic_Credit_Standard" title="Galactic Credit Standard">credits</a> to cover their living expenses.

<p>R2-D2 and Luke Skywalker participated in the Battle of <a href="/wiki/Yavin_Prime" title="Yavin Prime">Yavin</a>.

<p>After passing through the factory floor they arrived at the room where the negotiations were to be held. The Overseer invited them in to await the negotiator, but Han revealed that they weren't there to negotiate and gave R2-D2 the signal. R2-D2 began pouring a green liquid onto the floor, he then he electrocuted the fluid with his <a href="/wiki/Force_pike" title="Force pike">electric pike</a>. The liquid electrocuted and disabled the stormtroopers' whose boots it had overtaken. Luke, Han, and Leia then finished off the remaining troopers. Han asked Aggadeen where the main power core was, but the proud <a href="/wiki/Imperial_officer" title="Imperial officer">Imperial officer</a> refused to answer &#8212; until R2-D2 threatened to electrocute him too. Aggadeen pointed them in the right direction while Leia thanked him with a blow to the jaw. They arrived at the power core, where R2 plugged into the main <a href="/wiki/Computer" title="Computer">computer</a> and shut off all the safety restraints. Soon they had rigged the core to blow up in ten minutes' time. Han noticed that Luke was missing, but a minute later he arrived with more passengers &#8212; slaves of the Empire. The team prepared to retreat while C-3PO, who was waiting with the <i>Millennium Falcon</i> in the huge <a href="/wiki/Cymoon_1_refuse_fields" title="Cymoon 1 refuse fields">refuse fields</a> that surrounded the factory, brought the <i>Falcon</i> in to pick them up for their escape. Chewbacca, who was stationed on a large metal structure overlooking the landing platform where they had originally entered, reported that Darth Vader, the Dark Lord of the Sith, had arrived. Leia ordered the wookiee to kill Vader using his <a href="/wiki/Bowcaster" title="Bowcaster">bowcaster</a>. The wookiee tried but was thwarted by the dark lord. Chewbacca was out of contact, the entire moon was on alert and C-3PO still hadn't arrived. Soon, C-3PO informed the team via comlink that the old <a href="/wiki/Freighter" title="Freighter">freighter</a> was being dismantled by <a href="/wiki/Unidentified_Cymoon_1_species" title="Unidentified Cymoon 1 species">native scavengers</a>, and as such, the <i>Falcon's</i> <a href="/wiki/Autopilot" title="Autopilot">autopilot</a> was out of order. Han realized their escape had been foiled and led the team&#8212;with slaves in tow, to a large warehouse that housed several newly minted <a href="/wiki/All_Terrain_Armored_Transport" title="All Terrain Armored Transport">All Terrain Armored Transports</a> <a href="/wiki/Walker" title="Walker">walkers</a>. Han ordered everyone on board, they were going to walk right out of the factory.<sup id="cite_ref-Star_Wars_1:_Skywalker_Strikes_26-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Star_Wars_1:_Skywalker_Strikes-26"><span class="cite-bracket">&#91;</span>26<span class="cite-bracket">&#93;</span></a></sup>
</p><p>Han, Leia, and several slaves boarded the walker. Han piloted it through the heart of the factory smashing holes over twenty <a href="/wiki/Meter" title="Meter">meters</a> high through the facility's walls. Luke reappeared after confronting Vader and bid the slaves to follow him as he followed Han in the AT-AT. Meanwhile R2-D2 and his former enemies, the Jawas, began rewiring the walker's <a href="/wiki/Laser_cannon" title="Laser cannon">laser cannons</a> to get them operational. Han was arguing about their chances of death with Vader on their tail; Han asked the astromech on their progress. R2-D2, replied but Han did not understand the droid language of <a href="/wiki/Binary" title="Binary">Binary</a>. Han believed R2-D2 and the Jawas would get the cannons working&#8212;they just needed to give them the time. A short time later, Han attempted to step on Darth Vader with the AT-AT's massive feet. Vader used the dark side of the Force to hold the walker's foot several meters above himself and the ground&#8212;Han couldn't believe it. Vader began to crush the armored transport using the force, Han told R2-D2 "We need those guns!" R2-D2 spoke in his customary beeps and clicks; which Leia translated to "Fire!" The AT-AT opened fire on the Sith Lord and the factory walls as Han drove out of the facility. Leia was so happy she wanted to kiss the little droid&#8212;much to Han's annoyance.<sup id="cite_ref-Star_Wars_2:_Skywalker_Strikes_84-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Star_Wars_2:_Skywalker_Strikes-84"><span class="cite-bracket">&#91;</span>84<span class="cite-bracket">&#93;</span></a></sup>

<p>The AT-AT continued its escape outside, where it became vulnerable to attack from TIE fighters and other vehicles. Han and Leia realized that it had been too long &#8212; the factory should have melted down and exploded before this time. Chewbacca survived Vader's attack and returned to the <i>Falcon</i>, and was preparing to bring it in and extract the team. However, Vader was right beneath the walker, using his lightsaber to cut through the back left leg of the AT-AT. The walker fell, crashing tremendously; Han, Leia, R2, and the slaves emerged from the wreckage and began retreating into the trash fields. Luke, mounted on a <a href="/wiki/74-Z_speeder_bike" title="74-Z speeder bike">74-Z speeder bike</a>, returned to the factory and fired upon the core reactor &#8212; causing the facility to explode. While Vader and the Imperials were distracted Chewbacca swooped in with Han's <i>Falcon</i> and everyone boarded the freighter. Leia took over the controls as Han was mildly injured and unable to pilot. Chewbacca repaired the hyperdrive and they fled to lightspeed. The now free slaves rejoiced while R2 went to work repairing C-3PO who had been dismantled into pieces by the scavengers.<sup id="cite_ref-Star_Wars_3:_Skywalker_Strikes_85-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Star_Wars_3:_Skywalker_Strikes-85"><span class="cite-bracket">&#91;</span>85<span class="cite-bracket">&#93;</span></a></sup>

Soon thereafter, R2 boarded Luke's T-65B X-wing to leave the Rebel fleet. Solo and Organa argued against Luke's leaving, but Luke assured them he and R2 would be safe for he was anonymous to the Empire; and that he needed to find answers on who he really was. At Luke's request, Artoo set course to again go to Tatooine in the <a href="/wiki/Tatoo_system" title="Tatoo system">Tatoo system</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Star_Wars_4_87-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Star_Wars_4-87"><span class="cite-bracket">&#91;</span>87<span class="cite-bracket">&#93;</span></a></sup>
</p><p>Soon, Luke and R2 set down in the Jundland Wastes, and began the trek through the desert to Kenobi's former home. The suns were setting when they neared the hut, while Luke divulged in his reasoning for returning; nearly everything he knew about the Force he had learned from Ben Kenobi, and he believed that he sometimes heard the disembodied voice of the Jedi Master. However, Luke was interrupted when a Tusken Raider appeared and attacked him. R2 readied his electric pike, but did not have to use it, because at familiar sight of Luke's lightsaber, they ran. Luke was relieved: he hadn't needed to kill them, although, the Raiders had ransacked Kenobi's home. R2 went to work with his flashlight to locate anything Kenobi may have left to aid Luke in his journey to learn the Jedi way. While searching, Luke openly wondered why Kenobi had chosen to stay on Tatooine after all he had experienced. R2 knew it was to protect Luke from the Sith, until he was of age to become a Jedi &#8212; although, following Kenobi's lead, he did not tell the former-farmboy. Just then, a <a href="/wiki/Flash_grenade" title="Flash grenade">flash grenade</a> tumbled into the room and exploded; temporarily blinding Luke, and short-circuiting R2.<sup id="cite_ref-Star_Wars_5_86-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Star_Wars_5-86"><span class="cite-bracket">&#91;</span>86<span class="cite-bracket">&#93;</span></a></sup>

<p>While R2's systems rebooted, Luke fought Boba Fett, a bounty hunter sent by Darth Vader to capture Luke and bring him to the Dark Lord&#8212;although it was unknown to both Luke and Artoo at the time. Luke used his lightsaber and knocked Fett backwards where he tripped over R2. The two combatants, Fett with his Mandalorian armor, and Luke with the Force &#8212; though still blind &#8212; fought. Luke became more bloodied, and Fett more impatient. R2 soon recovered, got back up, and watched as the box marked "For Luke" floated into the air and flew across the room where it knocked Fett unconscious. Luke wondered aloud how he had done it, before asking R2-D2 to lead them back to the X-wing, for he was still unable to see. Later, as Tatooine's suns rose over the desert, Luke had recovered enough of his sight to open the box and examine its contents: "<a href="/wiki/The_Journals_of_Ben_Kenobi" title="The Journals of Ben Kenobi">The Journals of Ben Kenobi</a>."

<p>As the fight wore on, Grakkus' <a href="/wiki/Kreel" title="Kreel">Gamemaster</a> revealed himself to be working for the Imperials, sabotaging the match by activating the roggwart's <a href="/wiki/Shock_collar" title="Shock collar">shock collar</a>.

<p>Luke and R2-D2 came out of their crash unscathed, and began making their way back to base; searching for traces of the Jedi would have to wait for another time. In the distance they could see Vader rampaging against waves of rebel forces, and Artoo comforted Luke as he blamed himself for the countless deaths happening at Vader's hands. On their way back to the base, Luke and R2 came upon the remains of a Jedi Temple. As Luke tried to make sense of what he thought was a Force vision, they were discovered by C-3PO. R2-D2 tried to warn Luke, but it was too late; with Luke's back turned, Threepio revealed himself to be <a href="/wiki/0-0-0" title="0-0-0">0-0-0</a>, the protocol droid working for <a href="/wiki/Chelli_Lona_Aphra" title="Chelli Lona Aphra">Doctor Aphra</a> who specialized in torture, and incapacitated Luke with an intense shock to his shoulder.<sup id="cite_ref-Vader_13_95-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Vader_13-95"><span class="cite-bracket">&#91;</span>95<span class="cite-bracket">&#93;</span></a></sup>

Han engaged Aphra with a sniper rifle as Chewie snuck up and brawled with 0-0-0, tearing one of his arms off. Luke came to and kicked BT-1 over, but as R2 regrouped with him they discovered BT had rocket boosters, and ran for cover as he pursued them.<sup id="cite_ref-Star_Wars_13_96-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Star_Wars_13-96"><span class="cite-bracket">&#91;</span>96<span class="cite-bracket">&#93;</span></a></sup>

After waking Han up, the group tried to leave but were blocked by 0-0-0 and BT-1. This time, however, R2-D2 had a different trick up his sleeve.

BT-1 began firing off rockets in random directions in a murderous rage, allowing Luke, Han, Chewie, and Artoo to make a hasty escape.<sup id="cite_ref-Star_Wars_13_96-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Star_Wars_13-96"><span class="cite-bracket">&#91;</span>96<span class="cite-bracket">&#93;</span></a></sup>

<p>As the fight between Han and the two Wookiees dragged on, Black Krrsantan gained the upper hand against them. R2 hadn't given Chewbacca his antidote yet and couldn't get close to the brawl, but luckily he had loaded it into his casing and fired it at Chewbacca's leg. Immediately taking effect, Chewbacca roared and launched a successful counterattack against Krrsantan.<sup id="cite_ref-Star_Wars_14_98-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Star_Wars_14-98"><span class="cite-bracket">&#91;</span>98<span class="cite-bracket">&#93;</span></a></sup>

R2-D2 held out a comlink for 3PO to update Leia on their circumstances,<sup id="cite_ref-Star_Wars_14_98-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Star_Wars_14-98"><span class="cite-bracket">&#91;</span>98<span class="cite-bracket">&#93;</span></a></sup> who reluctantly agreed to withdraw from the duel she was witnessing between Vader and <a href="/wiki/Karbin" title="Karbin">Commander Karbin</a> in order to help them.<sup id="cite_ref-Vader_15_99-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Vader_15-99"><span class="cite-bracket">&#91;</span>99<span class="cite-bracket">&#93;</span></a></sup>
</p><p>C-3PO called on Black Krrsantan to stop fighting, which unwittingly worked as when Krrsantan instead punched him in the chest, his fried circuits connected with Krrsantan's brass knuckles, electrocuting and knocking out both of them.

<p>Sometime following the events on Vrogas Vas, R2-D2 alongside C-3PO escorted Leia and Sana Starros aboard the <i>Volt Cobra</i>, as they brought Doctor Aphra to be incarcerated at the highly secret <a href="/wiki/Sunspot_Prison" title="Sunspot Prison">Sunspot Prison</a>, a facility closely orbiting a star. After Aphra was locked up, they followed Leia and the <a href="/wiki/Unidentified_Sunspot_Prison_warden" title="Unidentified Sunspot Prison warden">warden</a> up to the control room. Suddenly, the prison experienced a hull breach, and the facility was beset upon by a group of mercenaries and <a href="/wiki/IG-RM_bodyguard_and_enforcer_droid" title="IG-RM bodyguard and enforcer droid">IG-RM droids</a> led by the former rebel spy <a href="/wiki/Eneb_Ray" title="Eneb Ray">Eneb Ray</a>, who was intent on murdering every criminal in the prison.<sup id="cite_ref-Star_Wars_16_100-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Star_Wars_16-100"><span class="cite-bracket">&#91;</span>100<span class="cite-bracket">&#93;</span></a></sup>

After the green creature revealed himself as Master Yoda, Skywalker began his Jedi training. R2-D2 observed the training from a distance. On one occasion, R2-D2 was present when Yoda used the Force to levitate Skywalker's X-wing starfighter from the swamp.<sup id="cite_ref-Star_Wars:_Episode_V_The_Empire_Strikes_Back_106-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Star_Wars:_Episode_V_The_Empire_Strikes_Back-106"><span class="cite-bracket">&#91;</span>106<span class="cite-bracket">&#93;</span></a></sup>
</p><p>On another training exercise, Luke Skywalker, under Yoda's instruction, used the Force to levitate R2-D2 and several rocks. However, Skywalker was distracted by a vision of his friend Han, Leia, and Chewbacca being tortured in a "<a href="/wiki/Cloud_City" title="Cloud City">city in the clouds</a>." Despite Yoda and Kenobi's warnings, Skywalker decided to adjourn his Jedi training and leave Dagobah to rescue his companions, but vowed to return and complete his training. Unknown to Luke and R2-D2, the vision was a trap created by Darth Vader to lure the young Jedi into a trap.

<p>After landing without any problems, the two entered the complex. While walking through Cloud City, R2-D2 and Luke caught a glimpse of Princess Leia and their companions being taken away by several Imperial stormtroopers. R2-D2 was separated from Luke after the latter ascended up a <a href="/wiki/Turbolift" title="Turbolift">turbolift</a> which led him to a carbon-freezing chamber. Later, R2-D2 managed to link up with C-3PO, Leia, and Chewbacca, who had all been freed by Lando. Lando had earlier betrayed his friend Han Solo, but then in a change of heart, decided to help the rebels escape the Empire. Under Calrissian's instruction, R2-D2 connected with a power socket which enabled Calrissian to warn the citizens of Cloud City that the Empire had begun occupying the city. After fighting several stormtroopers, R2-D2 and his companions managed to escape Cloud City on the <i>Millennium Falcon</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-Star_Wars:_Episode_V_The_Empire_Strikes_Back_106-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Star_Wars:_Episode_V_The_Empire_Strikes_Back-106"><span class="cite-bracket">&#91;</span>106<span class="cite-bracket">&#93;</span></a></sup>

<p>Later, R2-D2 and his companions learned that Han Solo was being held by Jabba on Tatooine.

They were then surrounded by several <a href="/wiki/Ewok" title="Ewok">Ewoks</a>, a species of furry bipeds native to Endor. Believing that C-3PO was a god, the Ewoks attempted to sacrifice Solo, Skywalker, Chewbacca, and R2-D2. When C-3PO failed to dissuade the Ewoks, Skywalker used the Force to cause C-3PO's throne to levitate. Fearing that they had angered their "god," the Ewoks promptly released their prisoners.<sup id="cite_ref-ROTJ_12-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ROTJ-12"><span class="cite-bracket">&#91;</span>12<span class="cite-bracket">&#93;</span></a></sup>

However, the rebel force was quickly captured by the Imperial garrison &#8212; although R2-D2 and C-3PO managed to evade capture. Under orders from R2-D2, C-3PO exposed his position to the Imperials. Shortly later, the Ewoks attacked the Imperial forces massed outside the shield generator. However, the Imperials managed to seal off the shield generator and launched a devastating counter-attack with <a href="/wiki/All_Terrain_Scout_Transport" title="All Terrain Scout Transport">AT-ST walkers</a>.

<p>During the fighting, R2-D2 and C-3PO made their way to the shield generator's blast door where Han and Leia were attempting to breach it. R2-D2 attempted to access the power socket, but was blasted by enemy fire, causing him to short-circuit. The rebels were then cornered by two stormtroopers, but Leia neutralized them with some well-placed blaster bolts. Meanwhile, Chewbacca and two Ewok warriors managed to turn the tide of the battle by hijacking an AT-ST walker and using it to destroy the others. Using the hijacked AT-ST, the rebels tricked the remaining Imperial troops into opening the shield generator. After storming the bunker, the rebels planted explosives which destroyed the energy field protecting the Death Star. This enabled the Rebels to destroy the second Death Star along with Emperor Palpatine, Darth Vader, and several Imperial ships. Following the Battle of Endor, R2-D2 was repaired and took part in the victory celebrations at <a href="/wiki/Bright_Tree_Village" title="Bright Tree Village">Bright Tree Village</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-ROTJ_12-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ROTJ-12"><span class="cite-bracket">&#91;</span>12<span class="cite-bracket">&#93;</span></a></sup>

<p>After Rey initially failed to convince Luke to help her, Luke was reunited with R2-D2 when he entered the <i>Falcon</i> to mourn the news that Han Solo was dead. Initially, Luke informed R2-D2 that he was resolute in his decision not to leave the planet or train Rey in the ways of the Force, but R2-D2 replayed the holographic recording of Leia asking Obi-Wan Kenobi for aid, inspiring Luke to accept Rey's request and give her at least a basic instruction in the ways and history of the Jedi. After Rey's failed attempt to redeem Kylo Ren, R2-D2 helped the <i>Falcon</i> track the other half of the binary signal device Rey was using to keep track of Leia's location while Rey and Chewbacca piloted the <i>Falcon</i> against the forces of the First Order. Once this fight was over, R2-D2 was once again reunited with his longtime friend, C-3PO.<sup id="cite_ref-Episode_VIII_124-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Episode_VIII-124"><span class="cite-bracket">&#91;</span>124<span class="cite-bracket">&#93;</span></a></sup>
