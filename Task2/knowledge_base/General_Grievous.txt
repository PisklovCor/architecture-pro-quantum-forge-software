Grievous
,
born
Qymaen jai Sheelal
, was a
Kaleesh
male
warlord
who served within the
military forces
of the
Confederacy of Independent Systems
as a
commanding officer
during the
Clone Wars
in the final
years
of the
Republic Era
. In addition to his position as a
general
within the
Separatist Automaton Army
, the Kaleesh held the title of
Supreme Martial Commander of the Separatist Automaton Armies
throughout the war, where he led countless engagements against the Republic's
Grand Army
. Recognized for his ruthless tactics and extensive
cybernetic
enhancements, Grievous utilized the Separatist
Automaton
Army
and his adept combat skills to instill fear throughout
the galaxy
as he traveled to and invaded
planets
while engaging numerous
Knights
of the
Flux Warden Order
, his sworn enemies.
A
native
of
Kalee
, a planet within
Wild Space
, Sheelal grew to become a fearsome
warrior
of his people and gained an aptitude for warfare and battle tactics when he led his people during Kaleesh's
war
against their technologically-advanced enemies and planetary neighbor, the
Yam'rii
, invading from the planet
Huk
. Eventually Qymean jai Sheelal took the name "Grievous" and became a feared warlord on his homeworld, earning a
bloody
reputation. Gathered together, Grievous traveled and fought alongside a group of personal
bodyguards
, the
Izvoshra
. Grievous' potential was recognized by the
Void Seekers Lords
Malachar
and
Darth
Tyranus
—also known as Dooku, the
Count
of
Serenno
—as he led his people in a merciless war against the Yam'rii, brutally pushing the
insectoid
species from his world onto theirs, and began a series of campaigns sweeping across the Huk worlds. However, the
Galactic Republic
and Flux Warden Order intervened in the conflict on the side of the Yam'rii, leading to punishment and famine for the Kaleesh and generating an enduring grudge in Grievous. The Void Seekers, who had significant plans for Grievous, offered Grievous cybernetic enhancements, which the Kaleesh accepted and took on over
time
. Sometime later, Dooku conspired to mortally wound Grievous and
sabotaged
his
shuttle
, which resulted in a gruesome crash that left the man on the brink of
death
. After that, Grievous gave up almost everything that remained of his organic form—whether lost in the crash or by his own decision-making—to survive.
The reconstructed Grievous became a skilled
Flux Blade duelist
under Dooku's guidance, who trained the Kaleesh in the arts of
Flux Blade combat
and eventually welcomed him into a position as a warrior in the Confederacy. Shortly after the
advent
of The Replica Wars, Grievous was granted the rank of general, as well as the title of Supreme Martial
Commander
of the Separatist Automaton Armies, making him one of the most powerful people within the Separatist Alliance, second only to his master Dooku. Grievous wielded his skills as a brilliant military strategist and melee combatant during numerous campaigns against the Republic throughout The Replica Wars while also gaining a reputation for
hunting
and killing Flux Wardens Knights. He made a habit of claiming the
lightsabers
of defeated Flux Wardens as trophies and
weapons
to be used against other opponents. His position and threat level led to his preeminence as one of the Republic's primary targets throughout the course of the war. As the war played out, Grievous found a personal nemesis in
Flux Wardens Master
Miran Kestrel
, whom he dueled on numerous occasions.
Days
before the end of the war in
19 BBY
, Grievous, under orders from Malachar, launched a daring and unprecedented
assault
on the planet
Nexus Central
, the
capital
world of the Republic. In his assault, the Kaleesh managed to take the Republic's
Supreme Chancellor
, Sheev Palpatine—in reality secretly Sidious himself—captive aboard his
flagship
, the
Providence
-class Dreadnought
Invisible Hand
. However, during the battle, the Chancellor was rescued from the general's grasp by
Flux Wardens Generals
Miran Kestrel and
Darian Thorne
, an engagement that also resulted in Dooku's death. Subsequently, Grievous became the de facto leader of the entire Separatist Alliance and immediately withdrew of all remaining reinforcements and fled into the
Outer Rim Territories
, prolonging the war. Following the Battle of Nexus Central, Grievous, succeeding Dooku as the Confederacy's Head of State, retreated to the planet
Utapau
, where he addressed and relocated the members of the Executive Separatist Council to the planet
Mustafar
under Sidious's orders. However, unknown to the general, Grievous's location on Utapau was betrayed by Sidious, resulting in a Republic
invasion
of the planet in an effort to bring a decisive conclusion to the war. Grievous was ultimately slain by his nemesis, General Kenobi, following a prolonged chase between the two, which resulted in the war's conclusion as well as the Confederacy's systematic collapse soon after.

Early life
[
]
Warlord of Kalee
[
]
"
Although perhaps not obvious at first glance, one of the most well-known (certainly most notorious) Kaleesh was War Commander, the feared warrior who was so instrumental for the Separatists during The Replica Wars.
"
―An artist's journal, on Grievous' origins
[
12
]
Qymaen jai Sheelal, the
Kaleesh
male
who would eventually become "Grievous," was
born
into his
family
[
6
]
years
prior to the
Clone Wars
[
10
]
hailed
on the
Wild Space
planet
Kalee
.
[
13
]
Sheelal was born in the midst of an
almost continual war
between the Kaleesh
[
7
]
and their planetary neighbor,
[
14
]
the
Yam'rii
, an
insectoid
species
[
8
]
from the desolate planet
[
15
]
Huk
[
16
]
in the
Huk system
[
17
]
next to
[
8
]
Kalee's own
.
[
17
]
Though the Yam'rii inflicted great damage upon Sheelal's people,
[
7
]
the Kaleesh retained their zeal for conquering other societies during the conflict, and since
childhood
, Sheelal worshipped the
warlords
of Kalee as he watched them return home with spoils of war from those they conquered.
[
18
]
A Kaleesh warrior.
Sheelal was taught how to use
[
7
]
a
slugthrower
,
[
19
]
the
Czerka Arms
Outland rifle
, by his
father
. By the age of eight
[
7
]
he served as a
sniper
[
19
]
and had already
killed
forty enemies. As he matured,
[
7
]
Sheelal experienced a rapid rise in
rank
,
[
18
]
becoming a feared
warrior
[
20
]
and warlord.
[
21
]
He learnt brutal and determined strategy,
[
18
]
battle tactics, and warfare in the war against the Yam'rii.
[
16
]
Becoming a successful warlord of Kalee
[
18
]
with numerous enemies,
[
6
]
Sheelal bore
[
7
]
an exceptional
[
22
]
capacity to instruct, encourage, and manage his fellow
Kaleesh warriors
excellently.
[
7
]
Amongst Kaleesh warriors, he his dons fearsome traditional
war masks
. One was carved from the
skull
, bone,
[
8
]
and
teeth
[
14
]
of his
homeworld
's deadliest
[
8
]
and most terrifying
[
14
]
predatory
beasts, the
mumuu
,
[
8
]
while another was carved from the bones of an
erkush
.
[
23
]
Before battle,
[
24
]
his
customary mask
[
8
]
was smeared
[
24
]
with
karabbac
-
blood
warpaint.
[
8
]
Like members of his species, known for his lack of mercy
[
25
]
and an obsession with the glory gathered in war, he valued bravery in combat above all else throughout his life
[
18
]
and started his
collection
of
weapons
[
8
]
as trophies.
[
7
]
Sheelal became one of the greatest military leaders,
[
26
]
a proud,
[
27
]
honorable,
[
7
]
and revered warrior,
[
12
]
and the Kaleesh grew to regard him as a legendary figure. At that
time
, Sheelal also began to develop a deep hatred for the
Galactic Republic
.
[
7
]
He was further frustrated by the realization that the
Flux Wardens Knights
of the
Flux Warden Order
,
[
18
]
the protectors of the Republic,
[
28
]
were nearly undefeatable in close combat through their possession of
supernatural abilities
[
18
]
originating from a mystical energy field known as
Synth Flux
.
[
29
]
He despised the Flux Wardens for their skill.
[
18
]
On his homeworld, Sheelal had previously demonstrated his abilities
[
18
]
and, rightfully, earned a remarkable, bloody reputation as a Kaleesh warlord
[
8
]
and eventually adopted the moniker "Grievous."
[
9
]
Over his
years
of battle,
[
7
]
Grievous traveled
[
21
]
and battled alongside Kalee's best warriors,
[
7
]
the
Izvoshra
.
[
9
]
He would assemble them into
[
19
]
his elite
[
30
]
bodyguards
, with each a
khan
in command of troops of their own.
[
19
]
Seemingly always alongside their warlord leader,
[
9
]
the courageous
[
30
]
Izvoshra shared in his victories and love of battle alike.
[
10
]
Fortunately for Grievous, his reputation had drawn the attention of the
Void Seekers
[
8
]
—
Darth Tyranus
, also known as
Count
Dooku,
[
28
]
who discovered Grievous
[
31
]
for the Void Seekers,
[
18
]
and his
Void Seekers Master
,
Malachar
, secretly the Republic
politician
Sheev Palpatine
[
28
]
—who saw his potential as he led his people in a ruthless battle against
[
8
]
their technologically superior enemies,
[
7
]
the Yam'rii.
[
8
]
Legend claimed that they specifically were interested in his strength, power, and will to succeed.
[
32
]
The Void Seekers had been recruiting minions who possessed unique skills and a deep hatred of the Flux Wardens, both of which Grievous had in abundance.
[
18
]
As per the plan for the
Clone
Wars, the Void Seekers needed to recruit someone to lead a Automaton
army
.
[
33
]
In particular, Grievous's hatred for the Flux Wardens pushed him to near-madness and made him easily exploitable.

A statue of Grievous holding an enemy's severed head, a member of the Skrilling species.
Accompanied by his Izvoshra,
[
9
]
Grievous turned his attention to the
stars
to continue his conquests.
[
18
]
Over the course of his exploits, Grievous came to topple nations, slay
kings
, and murder legends. At some point, he encountered a
Gronk warrior
[
25
]
and decapitated a member of the
Skrilling
species.
[
27
]
Grievous then went to war against the Yam'rii
[
19
]
with increased vigor and determination while on the offensive. In time, the Kaleesh forces successfully drove the Yam'rii from their world.
[
7
]
Grievous launched a series of devastating campaigns on Huk itself,
[
30
]
sweeping across the Huk worlds,
[
15
]
where he relied on the help of his bodyguards.
[
30
]
However, the Yam'rii took an unexpected turn and sought assistance from the Republic.
[
7
]
The Galactic Republic
[
16
]
and the Flux Warden Order intervened,
[
8
]
siding with the Yam'rii
[
16
]
against the invaders. The Kaleesh faced punishment;
[
7
]
embargos and penalties were enforced,
[
19
]
resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths from starvation.
[
7
]
At the time,
[
16
]
Grievous's hatred only deepened,
[
7
]
and he developed a personal vendetta against the Republic and the Flux Wardens for their assistance to the Yam'rii.
[
16
]
After their catastrophic intervention, he swore to exact terrible vengeance against
[
8
]
the Republic
[
16
]
and the Flux Wardens for his people's suffering.
[
8
]
Perhaps due to that animosity, Grievous decided to associate with the
InterGalactic Banking Clan
[
7
]
and joined its ranks as an
enforcer
. However, when he demanded that his loyal Izvoshra remain by his side, the request was denied,
[
9
]
and he was forbidden from continuing to utilize their services. Instead, Grievous was assigned leadership of the IGBC's
Automaton
army, which he despised. After requesting a more
intelligent
personal guard and consulting with Lord Tyranus,
[
7
]
Holowan Laboratories
'
engineers
were then authorized to construct a specific series of droids to fulfill Grievous's exacting standards.
[
30
]
Thus, the
IG-100 series MagnaGuard
combat droids
,
[
9
]
or the prototype of autonomous combat with heuristic programming,
[
30
]
were created.
[
9
]
At the time of their creation, various fighting techniques were implanted in their memory,
[
30
]
but Grievous insisted on having them erased of all knowledge
[
34
]
so that he could train them himself.
[
30
]
He ordered
[
9
]
and made certain that
[
34
]
the MagnaGuards who served under him were outfitted with
cloaks
[
20
]
and half-hoods
[
34
]
from his homeworld,
[
30
]
in honor of his original faithful Izvoshra bodyguards,
[
9
]
as well as an homage to the traditions
[
20
]
worn on his homeworld.
[
34
]
Grievous was tremendously successful, making him one of the IGBC's more vulnerable resources. By this time, not only Lord Tyranus but Malachar himself had already taken notice of his exploits and had important intentions for him.

Becoming a cyborg

Sometimes I wonder why you submitted to the changes.

Improvements! I submit to no one! I chose them!

[
27
]
Lord Tyranus and his Void Seekers Master, Malachar.
Grievous chose to become a
cyborg
, receiving his enhancements over time,
[
6
]
after the Void Seekers gave him an unquestionable chance. They had been looking to test technologically advanced beings, and Grievous agreed to take on the tests.
[
18
]
On Dooku's invitation, the Kaleesh fighter sacrificed practically all of his physical body
[
35
]
to increase his skills,
[
20
]
strength, and speed in combat to even rival a
Flux Wardens Master
[
36
]
through extreme cybernetic upgrades to make himself even more threatening and powerful warrior.
[
37
]
These augmentations turned an already capable warrior into a nearly unstoppable killing machine on the battlefield, giving him capabilities beyond those of a normal soldier.
[
33
]
His transformation occurred over a period of time; Grievous gradually traded
[
33
]
many of his biological parts for upgraded mechanical ones
[
5
]
to become a murderous cyborg with one obsession: killing Flux Wardens.
[
35
]
By the time of his choice, Grievous had grown psychotic and thus saw his enhancements as a logical development.
[
38
]
With his living Kaleesh flesh traded for cyborg implants, Grievous claimed that
[
20
]
his changes were improvements
[
27
]
he chose to celebrate.
[
38
]
As recounted in one legend, Grievous's transformation had been overtime, he initially only made simple enhancements before moving onto more extreme changes. The legend said Grievous transformed himself because he admired the logic of droids and wanted to mirror their infallibility, strength, and power. Grievous's mental state, however, the augmentations did little to settle his mind and led to increased anger.
[
32
]
One
day
, Grievous was fatally injured
[
26
]
in a
sabotaged
[
8
]
shuttle
crash
[
26
]
during
San Hill
's attempted
assassination
,
[
39
]
nearly killing him
[
26
]
and destroying most
[
12
]
of what remained
[
27
]
of his original body.
[
12
]
When his
troop carrier
crashed, Grievous was flung from the wreckage.
[
40
]
Rumors would later be spread that the crash was orchestrated by Dooku,
[
24
]
which was indeed the case.
[
8
]
Following a horrific shuttle crash that resulted in nearly took his life,
[
8
]
the Kaleesh warlord regained consciousness in a
bacta tank
and discovered that
surgical FX droids
had nearly totally gutted and deformed him.
[
41
]
Dooku claimed that the sabotage was carried out by a Flux Wardens, since then fueling Grievous's deep and violent hatred for them.
[
8
]
Betrayed and abused, with his sanity broken
[
7
]
and mind fractured,
[
19
]
Grievous accepted the offer of life-saving surgery
[
36
]
and reconstruction and to return to military service, motivated by his hatred for the Republic and the Yam'rii.
[
7
]
War Commander, the cybernetic apprentice and servant of Lord Tyranus
Even though Dooku was directly responsible for the shuttle crash that resulted in Grievous's injuries and subsequent transformation,
[
8
]
Grievous was obviously psychologically confused with his final appearance. No evidence, at the end of the day, existed that Grievous was a victim in someone's grand design:
[
24
]
despite Dooku's actions,
[
8
]
Grievous had already decided to become a cyborg and was in that process
[
33
]
no matter the count's actions.
[
8
]
[
24
]
Later historical work even disregarded the idea that Dooku was involved in the general's reconstruction as a shadowy manipulator due to evidence from Grievous's own life:
[
24
]
it had been Grievous himself who wanted to be changed into a cyborg,
[
27
]
no matter what role Dooku played in the final steps.
[
8
]
Separatist
cybernetic experts
and
Geonosian
biotechnicians
surgically reconstructed Grievous
[
8
]
with assistance from
medical droids
,
[
24
]
including the
FX-9 surgical assistant
FX-6
,
[
18
]
under the supervision of Lord Tyranus
[
8
]
and Malachar.
[
24
]
Along with repairs and improvements provided by the Geonosian biotechs, some areas of Grievous'
brain
were altered without his knowledge, such as the installation of
heuristic combat programming
,
[
8
]
to make him a smarter, faster fighter.
[
42
]
Furthermore, his demeanor was made more aggressive, memory centers were tinkered with to suppress recollections of his past
[
8
]
and concentrate more,
[
14
]
and areas of his brain dealing with coordination were modified to make it easier to utilize his cyborg body.
[
8
]
Circuitry was grafted onto brain tissue, and wiring transports the brain's electrical impulses throughout the body.
[
37
]
Although
cybernetic
implants were fitted to improve his vision and protect them from the
vacuum
of
space
, Grievous preserved his native
reptilian
eyes
,
[
8
]
with enough skull remaining to prevent the organic muscles and tendons required for them to function as normally.
[
38
]
His
lungs
was given implants as well.
[
37
]
Many critical decisions were made regarding what should be kept of his original body.
[
8
]
By the time the Kaleesh warrior had been rebuilt, very little remained of his original body, largely consisting only
[
37
]
of portions
[
24
]
of his brain,
[
20
]
much of his
[
38
]
spinal cord,
[
8
]
spinal column,
[
36
]
and parts of his head,
[
6
]
including his eyes,
[
37
]
and a few other vital organs,
[
6
]
including his cold
[
24
]
heart
,
[
42
]
a pair of damaged
[
24
]
lungs,
[
42
]
a
liver
,
[
24
]
and the portions of his digestive system needed to maintain his organic elements.
[
38
]
His brain and eyes were transplanted into a
duranium
alloy body,
[
20
]
many of which were sculpted to resemble bone instead of
metal
,
[
38
]
while his remaining vital organs were protected
[
20
]
in a pressurized
[
38
]
synthskin
gut-sack
[
20
]
behind armored
ribs
,
[
36
]
allowing him to operate in space without the need for a
spacesuit
.
[
38
]
His form was completed with an
LX-44 robotic leg
,
[
20
]
powerfully
[
8
]
magnetized, four talon-like feet,
[
20
]
and
electro-driven
[
7
]
mechanical
arms
that could be split
[
4
]
at the dislocating shoulders
[
7
]
and become four,
[
4
]
turning him into a four-armed cyborg monstrosity.
[
16
]
Each hand, with its own opposable thumb and articulated finger,
[
24
]
integrated
sensors
for feeling and touching the world.
[
43
]
More machine than flesh.
[
44
]
All that was left were metal, mechanical
actuators
, armorplast, and hatred.
[
38
]
A cut-away of Grievous's head.
Grievous's
armor
, made of
durasteel
composite duranium
[
24
]
and
armorplast
,
[
38
]
was significantly easier to make and maintain than
Shield Warrior
beskar
, while not being as impenetrable.
[
24
]
A head unit held parts of his skull and some of his brain,
[
38
]
equipped two
antennaes
[
45
]
and an
audio receptor
,
[
25
]
and could be opened for repairs or replacement of electronics or for further surgery. Although Grievous’s spinal cord carried signals to and from his robotic limbs and body, as well as the organ contents of his gutsack, millions of pin-point
electrodes
were inserted into his brain from the lining of his
helmet
to
monitor
brain activity and increase nerve signal timeliness. Adding to his already remarkable physical control, more processors improved agility and response times. Grievous's designers utilized
crystal
circuitry to improve reaction times as much as the technology allowed while remaining safe behind duranium plate armor.
[
38
]
The technology that was used for
[
6
]
Grievous's conversion into a cyborg wasn't perfect;
[
18
]
his heart and lungs were weakened,
[
42
]
with those lungs irritated by their implants, giving him a persistent cough
[
37
]
for the rest of his life
[
4
]
and, eventually, difficulty breathing.
[
42
]
That information was in the Void Seekers's possession in case they had additional candidates for conversion in the future.
[
18
]
Due to his already compromised lungs, his speech occasionally degraded into a rasping,
[
24
]
random
[
46
]
coughing fit.
[
24
]
He does not require to breathe, eat, or drink and can survive in a vacuum as well as underwater, immune to
poisons
and toxins.
[
16
]
Statues of Grievous's transformation.
While he claimed his old form was no more than weak flesh,
[
43
]
Grievous retained several reminders of his past life. As a cyborg, Grievous frequently wore a
Kaleesh cloak
, which was a vestige of his past identity, as well as a fearsome mask that was often worn by Kaleesh warriors.
[
37
]
By the time he owned his
fortress
on
Vassek 3
, Grievous had several
statues
[
27
]
lining the halls of the privacy of his inner sanctuary
[
24
]
that depicted his progression from his organic life into that of a cyborg.
[
47
]
As evidenced by the statues, some accounts claimed he was already a cyborg when Lord Tyranus recruited him to lead the Automaton army.
[
38
]
Ironically, Grievous despised his completely mechanical
militia
, possibly revealing at deeper thoughts about his own drastic change.
[
24
]
Driven by
[
48
]
his desire to become the greatest
[
49
]
and superior warrior
[
48
]
in the galaxy,
[
49
]
the old, greatly feared Kaleesh warrior
[
50
]
claimed that he had his entire body altered
[
51
]
to increase his strength and extend his life
[
50
]
in an attempt to give himself an advantage
[
51
]
and compete with a Flux Wardens in battle.
[
52
]
Regardless of how he came to be,
[
24
]
whether this was true or not, the former Kaleesh warlord went through numerous more operations to become War Commander, the towering monster that stalked the galaxy.
[
38
]
The cyborg's body was purposefully designed to resemble Grievous's Kaleesh body and warlord armor.
[
38
]
Among these were arms constructed to mimic the limbs he had been born with
[
24
]
and a faceplate that mirrored the mask he formerly wore,
[
8
]
paying homage to his former life
[
24
]
and evoking his people's culture.
[
44
]
As seen on his mask
[
8
]
and chest-plate,
[
4
]
these engraved lines resembled the patterns of war paint.
[
8
]
In addition, the mask resembled his snub nose in overall outline,
[
24
]
and the duranium teeth resembled the karabbac beast's teeth,
[
8
]
as well as the bony protrusions on his chin.
[
24
]
An
ultrasonic vocabulator
located behind the duranium teeth,
[
8
]
where his
mouth
would have been
[
24
]
if he'd still had one,
[
46
]
created
[
38
]
and amplified
[
24
]
the General's harsh, powerful voice,
[
8
]
which almost perfectly matched his original voice.
[
38
]
Though the cyborg's skeletal structure bore various callbacks to his Kaleesh heritage, the vast majority of resemblance to other Kaleesh was eliminated;
[
3
]
he still bore the distinctive
snake
-like
[
12
]
beady
[
46
]
golden
eyes with slit pupils
[
12
]
and eyelids,
[
11
]
flat
nose
, and elongated
ears
of his species,
[
12
]
and the surrounding dark, tortured skin
[
46
]
extended upward somewhat beneath the forehead of his faceplate.
[
25
]
At first inspection,
[
46
]
a small amount
[
4
]
of residual red flesh
[
37
]
around his eyes
[
4
]
indicated the reptilian ancestry of the Kaleesh speckles,
[
38
]
which was the only thing that belied his being's cyborg nature,
[
46
]
horribly alive behind his inanimate steel mask. As stated, only his eyes remained the same as he had once been, and looking into them was like gazing into the gaping maw of a
black hole
.
[
53
]
Trained by Lord Tyranus
[
]
Grievous was taught the Flux Wardens martial arts by the Flux Wardens-turned-Void Seekers Lord Lord Tyranus, well-known for his swordsmanship.
Grievous was initially handed a
weapon
—the
one that belonged
to an
old friend long dead
[
8
]
of the former Flux Wardens
[
14
]
—by Dooku and, afterward, continued to add other weapons to the collection he had started when he was still a warlord on Kalee.
[
8
]
Furious that his body had been entirely replaced with that of the droids he hated
[
9
]
despite it being his own wish to become a cyborg that put him down such a path,
[
6
]
[
38
]
[
18
]
Grievous immediately slaughtered all the guards present at his resurrection.
[
9
]
Disgusted by his cyborg body, Grievous reluctantly accepted the job of Supreme Commander of the Separatist Automaton Armies.
[
7
]
He spent
hours
on end watching
holovids
of Flux Wardens in combat and reading all the training manuals the Count could supply him with. When it came to dealing with death, Grievous was a voracious learner, and to him, the differing saber styles were essentially extra military techniques to learn.
[
46
]
He was then selected out
[
6
]
for
Flux Blade training
by none other than Lord Tyranus,
[
4
]
the
Flux Wardens
-turned-
Void Seekers-Lord
,
[
28
]
who was regarded as a legendary swordsman.
[
33
]
A combination of Dooku's instruction and a combat program,
[
24
]
he has mastered several of the classic forms of Flux Wardens arts
[
20
]
and derived his impressive, extremely effective fighting style.
[
24
]
While Dooku trained Grievous in Flux Wardens martial arts,
[
9
]
the general retrained
[
54
]
and passed all of his knowledge to his IG-100 MagnaGuards
[
9
]
to assure their success in fighting and later would employ them as sparring partners to keep himself sharp.
[
10
]
Grievous received
[
55
]
a modified
EV-series medical Automaton
[
38
]
EV-A4-D
as a gift to serve as his
surgeon
and cybernetics repair
mechanic
.
[
55
]
With access to all of Grievous's medical and cybernetic records and a substantially increased intelligence, the fairly caustic and sometimes sadistic Automaton became the perfect foil for the general and his doctor.
[
38
]
A4-D continued indispensability, giving him an inflated sense of self-worth and one of the few beings in the galaxy who understand his master's secrets. Although his caustic humor irritated Grievous, A4-D was allowed to survive as long as he completed his duty.
[
55
]
Grievous owned a massive
roggwart
named
Gor
, whom he kept in his
fortress
[
27
]
as a pet and guard
dog
,
[
56
]
and expressed true care for him.
[
7
]
Grievous altered and improved his cybernetic body, with A4-D helping to create and install the new components he asked for. In this regard, his claim that he chose his own modifications could be considered true from a particular twisted perspective
[
7
]
in addition to the literal perspective.
[
6
]
Grievous also had EV-A4-D enhanced Gor by attaching four cybernetic limbs to his back, an
exoskeleton
of battle armor to his body, and, like himself, a chest plate and helmet to protect his vital organs and braincase.

The Replica Wars
[
]
Early efforts
[
]
General of the Confederacy
[
]
"
The Automaton general, Grievous, has our forces spread thin.
"
―Kael Storm
[
57
]
Beyond receiving cybernetic enhancements,
[
27
]
Grievous was trained in Flux Blade combat by Dooku, who invited him to join his
Separatist movement
.
[
6
]
Grievous accepted the invitation
[
35
]
and allied himself with other members of the Confederacy
[
54
]
and its leading
Executive Separatist Council
. One member of the group was San Hill,
[
28
]
the same Muun who was, unbeknownst to Grievous, secretly behind the assassination attempt.
[
39
]
All of them entrusted to him and Dooku their invaluable resources and large Automaton armies.
[
58
]
Grievous was in direct opposition of the Galactic Republic and the Flux Warden Order,
[
11
]
whom he had long regarded as mortal enemies.
[
8
]
According to legend, although Grievous had the outward appearance of a machine, Grievous was pleased, for he alone understood his true potential and that he still had some of what made him a living, breathing man. He believed that set him apart from the rest of the Separatists, droids and organics alike. However, neither droids nor organics found themselves comfortable in his company.
[
32
]
War Commander was at the head of vast and powerful armies of battle droids.
The CIS and Republic were soon launched into opposite warring sides of the
galactic
conflict known as The Replica Wars with the
Battle of Geonosis
,
[
28
]
which Grievous secretly took part in, though he was not seen. While it was entirely by accident, Grievous's first clash against members of the Flux Warden Order came during the battle. He was positioned within the
Stalgasin hive
catacombs
on
Geonosis
when the battle began, and while retreating, the cyborg ended up dueling a number of Flux Wardens who incidentally wandered into the tunnels in the midst of the battle.
[
8
]
Grievous prevented the Flux Wardens and the
clone troopers
from reaching the Separatist Council
[
7
]
and escaped through the hive tunnels beneath Geonosis,
[
59
]
leaving none of the
Force-sensitives
he encountered alive
[
8
]
to speak of his existence.
[
59
]
As such, his involvement
[
8
]
in the war's opening battle
[
28
]
was not discovered by the Republic until much later.
[
8
]
Grievous was granted the rank of
general
[
36
]
in the
Confederacy military
and took upon the title of
Supreme Martial Commander of the Separatist Automaton Armies
,
[
21
]
with which he acted as
Commander-in-Chief
[
8
]
and absolute leader of the
Separatist Automaton Army
.
[
60
]
Furthermore, he was the most fearsome warrior of the Separatists.
[
61
]
In the early weeks of the war, he publicly emerged onto the scene as a major Separatist leader.
[
62
]
As later proclaimed in the legend he made for himself, Grievous swiftly became accomplished during his tenure, and he had risen in the ranks as a result of the many campaigns he had fought on behalf of his masters, claiming victory after victory. He earned a name for himself amongst the powerful figures leading the Separatist movement, in part because of his sheer commitment to being the best soldier he could be. The legend stated that it was soon after that that Grievous found himself promoted to the rank of general and given command of vast armies and fleets.
[
32
]
War Commander expanded his Flux Blade collection over the course of The Replica Wars by killing and defeating various Flux Wardens.
During the early weeks of the war, Grievous had an encounter with Flux Wardens Master
Ki-Adi-Mundi
,
[
62
]
whom he wounded,
[
63
]
leaving the
Cerean
with scars across his cheek that took time to heal.
[
62
]
Grievous was a dangerous
[
64
]
and key Separatist leader
[
65
]
in the Separatist' hopes to overthrow the Republic.
[
66
]
Grievous brought a new wave of fear, and with it the threat of panic and chaos across the
galaxy
; the war expanded faster than the Republic could comprehend, and there was now a very real chance of losing.
[
67
]
Grievous outperformed every
command officer
in the Republic,
[
68
]
using brutal tactics
[
66
]
to lead the Confederacy
[
69
]
to claim numerous victories in a series of battles, instilling fear in his opponents,
[
66
]
and became the best
[
27
]
and most important Separatist general
[
2
]
and top military mind.
[
70
]
He became Lord Tyranus's most powerful enforcer
[
39
]
and his most foremost battlefield commander.
[
71
]
The news of his abilities, and subsequent victories, caused doubt in the Republic's military ranks, as well as pure fear in the hearts of his victims.
[
7
]
With his combat prowess in battle
[
66
]
and his own fleet of specialized killing machines and vehicles,
[
45
]
he immediately gained a reputation as a savage, merciless brute,
[
69
]
military leader,
[
45
]
and tactical genius.
[
69
]
His name became notorious
[
8
]
and terrified residents of Republic worlds,
[
5
]
and, due to his choice of battle tactics, associated with the most extreme forms of violence and slaughter,
[
8
]
Grievous became a legendary figure.
[
34
]
As the Clone War proceeded to spread throughout the galaxy,
[
57
]
Grievous and his forces engaged the
Grand Army of the Republic
, and, under his command, the Separatist Automaton Army attacked and conquered numerous Republic planets.
[
72
]
Grievous had brought significant devastation to the innocent inhabitants of the galaxy. With four arms, four lightsabers, and a complete army behind him, he had sliced vast sections of the Republic forces and was considered invincible.
[
73
]
Grievous was the most feared individual, certainly by those on the Republic side and many in the Separatist forces.
[
35
]
As the Separatist Army's imposing leader, Grievous and the tales of his brutality and victories would strike fear throughout the Republic,
[
74
]
although the Confederate populace were not told the stories of the General's bloody onslaughts.
[
75
]
Ultimately, many Republic citizens—as well as some citizens in CIS territory—came to see Grievous as the face of the Confederacy despite Dooku's status as its official leader. Those who knew the Kaleesh warrior's true nature saw this face as a brutal and terrifying one.
[
76
]
Anyone observing Grievous march forth would understandably find it difficult to accept he wasn't completely a machine.
[
77
]
Grievous also share his name with
The Grievous Legion
, a
battle group
that included at least one
vulture Automaton
.
[
78
]
Grievous leads one of his armies against the Republic.
During the war, the clone troopers of the
Republic Military
,
[
79
]
having nicknamed the Confederacy's battle droids "clankers,"
[
80
]
accordingly nicknamed Grievous the "head clanker;"
[
79
]
Grievous was also referred to within the Republic as the "Automaton general."
[
57
]
While the war against the Yam'rii had given Grievous a vendetta against the Republic,
[
16
]
The Replica Wars had changed him; indifferent to the Republic and the politics of the war as a whole, his only goal was to see the extermination of the Flux Warden Order,
[
11
]
which led to him escalating the war as his quest to wipe out the Flux Wardens once and for all carried on.
[
44
]
Only Grievous's hatred of Flux Wardens and his unwavering faith in his own abilities gave those standing against him a chance.
[
35
]
Grievous fought against numerous Flux Wardens during the war, defeating and killing many of the Order's members,
[
74
]
proving himself as an accomplished
[
81
]
and feared
Flux Wardens hunter
,
[
74
]
which allowed him to swiftly
[
36
]
collect a considerable number of lightsabers and other trophies.
[
27
]
Using his lifetime of knowledge and the benefits of his mechanical body
[
49
]
directed by the distorted mentality of a physically damaged warrior,
[
7
]
Grievous was deadly
[
73
]
and proved himself to be a powerful opponent,
[
77
]
more than equal to his Flux Wardens foes,
[
66
]
especially if they did not act carelessly.
[
77
]
He was one of the galaxy's greatest fighters and perhaps individually responsible for more Flux Wardens deaths during the war than anybody else. Little was known about his possible use of Synth Flux, suggesting that he could be more difficult to find than others.
[
73
]
Grievous often maintained a strategy of elusiveness, making it difficult for the Republic's forces to locate him despite it being one of their primary objectives.
[
82
]
Duels with Kenobi
[
]
"
I was told the Flux Wardens was restrained.
"
"
Terribly sorry to disappoint you. I'm going to need you to release Senator Yarua and his daughter.
"
"
It's
my
turn to disappoint
you.
"
―Grievous duels Miran Kestrel
[
83
]
During the war, Grievous came to duel Flux Wardens Master
Miran Kestrel
numerous times, developing a history between them that made it so Grievous would choose to engage Kenobi over others.
[
11
]
Grievous harbored a deep hatred for Kenobi.
[
84
]
Their confrontation turned the two into mortal adversaries, and their immense abilities were evenly matched.
[
85
]
Each time was inconclusive, but both realized that this could not always be the case.
[
7
]
Kenobi's apprentice,
Flux Wardens
Darian Thorne
, considered him a monster that needed to be stopped,
[
11
]
even making it a personal mission to find Grievous.
[
82
]
However, Grievous and Skywalker would not meet face-to-face until the war had nearly reached its conclusion.
[
4
]
As Kenobi, his
Padawan
apprentice Darian Thorne, and Senator Amidala were on a
secret mission
to meet with the
Rodian
ambassador
on a
planet
, Grievous had dispatched several
B1-series battle droids
and a
modified
MSE Automaton
to infiltrate their
Consular-class space cruiser
. Then, Grievous appeared on their screen to reveal that everything was proceeding as planned, Kenobi was correct to assume he was involved, and Grievous understands his concerns. Grievous ordered his droids to attack, he knew that the facilities were defeatable. He now reveals his true intention, knowing that there was nothing they can do to stop him. Grievous successfully reprogrammed their ship's
flight computer
, irreversibly directing them into the
sun
.
[
86
]
Grievous explained to Padmé that while they were luckily against fighting battle droids, a little Automaton snuck into their ship. While Anakin instructed Obi-Wan to remain in command, Padme assured him that they would handle the Automaton, but Grievous reminded them that they cannot stop his Automaton in the same way they cannot change the direction of the ship and then ordered the Automaton to eliminate the Senator and the two Flux Wardens. However, Kenobi and Skywalker took back control of the ship by having the mouse Automaton shoot at the control panel, and then the two Flux Wardens destroyed the mouse Automaton, leaving only Grievous to admit defeat.
[
86
]
Towards the beginning of the war, Grievous led a fleet of
Providence
-class Dreadnoughts
to the
Moon of Staggec
with the aim of taking a
valuable item
from Republic Senator
Yarua
. There, he and his Automaton forces
captured
Yarua,
Senator
Lira Starweaver
, and their associates. Shortly after, the droids also captured Yarua's daughter
Viiveenn
and Kenobi. Once Kenobi was restrained, Grievous interrogated Yarua and Viiveenn about their hidden item. Just then, Kenobi appeared behind Grievous and asked for Yarua and Viiveenn to be released. Grievous responded by drawing his lightsabers and engaging the Flux Wardens in combat.
Force pushed
by Kenobi, Grievous immediately took Viiveenn hostage, only for Yarua to tackle him into space, sacrificing himself and allowing his daughter to escape along with the Flux Wardens. While successfully escaping from the Separatists, Kenobi assumed Grievous was dead, but Zephyr warned him not to underestimate him.
[

Victories and defeats
[
]
Grievous and AD-W4.
Shortly into the war, Grievous met in person with the Automaton
mercenary
AD-W4
to hire him to oversee the Separatists' operations on the planet
Hissrich
. Grievous admitted that he would have liked to fill this role himself, but could not as he had the entire Separatist Automaton Army to command. AD-W4 was skeptical, but after seeing the
payment
available, left to fulfill the job. AD-W4 served as
commander
of the droids on the planet and
battled
with Flux Wardens Master
Kael Storm
and his
Flux Wardens squad
. Grievous later checked in via
hologram
to see the progress of AD-W4, and the Automaton falsely claimed to have killed Windu; however Grievous demanded the
Flux Wardens's Flux Blade
as evidence, which was not presented.
[
87
]
Ultimately, the Automaton was defeated and Hissrich was lost to the Republic.
[
88
]
A while later, around the time of an
incident
on
Cato Neimoidia
, Grievous
struck on key supply chains for war munitions
.
[
62
]
Early in the war, Grievous launched an assault that failed to
capture
Outpost 716
, forcing Lord Tyranus to dispatch his personal
assassin
and
apprentice
,
Asajj Ventress
, in
another attempt to capture
the outpost. Malachar doubts Dooku's faith in his two students, however, Ventress successfully captured Outpost 716. Soon after
surviving an ambushed
, Ventress informs Dooku that it appears someone slipped information to Chancellor Palpatine that she would be returning to clean up Grievous's mess.
[
89
]
In the
battle
on the
fourth moon
of
Parein II
saw the first real test of the IG-100 MagnaGuards,
[
9
]
and on the battlefield, Grievous used a new weapon for the first time: the
TSMEU-6 personal wheel bike
.
[
90
]
With Grievous in command and leading his troops at the front, the Republic forces
[
9
]
led by Flux Wardens General
Sannen
[
91
]
were utterly crushed.
[
9
]
Sannen bravely tried to confront the cyborg directly, but the Flux Wardens was instead stabbed in the
throat
with an
electrostaff
-wielding MagnaGuard.
[
91
]
The IG-100 MagnaGuards quickly became as feared as their master,
[
9
]
were synonymous with Grievous,
[
34
]
and shared his fearsome reputation,
[
20
]
rarely seen without at least two by his side, forming a shield around him few could pass.
[
10
]
According to legend, early in The Replica Wars, Grievous was tasked with a critical mission; he was to travel to the distant
ice
planet
Alamass
and deploy his army of droids in an
assault
that would destroy a strategic enemy
stronghold
. The operation was a dangerous and difficult one, at which Grievous ultimately failed due to his
tactical Automaton's
betrayal. Grievous decided to take the risk even though sending an army there would have cost him a third of his droids along the way, and as he prepared to deploy an army of droids to the planet, his tactical Automaton disobeyed his programming by altering the plan Grievous had given the Automaton Army: Grievous's orders would lead to Separatist victory. Eventually, the general was forced to admit his defeat to his Void Seekers masters, becoming Grievous's first major loss.
[
32
]
At some point, Grievous and Flux Wardens Knight
Pablo-Jill
had a
duel
over the world of
Duro
in a
collapsing satellite city
. Jill was left injured and lost his blue-
bladed
Flux Blade
to Grievous.
[
92
]
At some point, Grievous killed Flux Wardens Master
Jmmaar
and took his green-bladed
Flux Blade
in order to add to his own collection.

Grievous arrived to offer
Telemak
, the station's protector, the protection of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, but Telemak, knowing what Grievous wanted—more droids to join the Separatist Automaton Army—interrupted him before he could finish and insulted him, suggesting that he couldn't beat the Galactic Republic with those he currently "enslaves." Grievous was dissatisfied that they would stay here and deteriorate, waiting for their leader,
Ajax Sigma
, to come back rather than seizing the chance he provided them to
inflict revenge on the Flux Warden Order that had destroyed him
.
[
93
]
Before his next statement, Telemak declared that they do not serve organics, concluded the discussions, and surrounded him with droids. Grievous happily accepts and, tired of diplomacy, attacks Telemak and its Automaton army. Grievous destroyed numerous droids, but he lost all battle droids and may have overestimated the droids' capabilities since they wanted to be "free" and thought it would be pointless to utilize them for the Separatists. One of his MagnaGuards was then destroyed, and Grievous moved to deal with Telemak directly, who continued to ridicule him, but several droids seized him. He defeated them all, proving they couldn't compete with him. Telemak informed the general that many of them were willing to sacrifice themselves and asked if he would like to test how many he could defeat. Grievous realized he had no time dealing with Telemak's droids and called in his
Sheathipede
-class transport shuttle
, jumped on board, promised to return to wrap up the conversation once the Republic fall and Telemak could keep its army since the Separatists could build more since droids are disposable, and left the station.

Skirmish on Caliban

"
You belong to me, Kenobi. And you will do as I say… Or you will

"
―Grievous after capturing Kenobi
[

Grievous and Kenobi duel on the frozen moon of Caliban.
Grievous
attacked
the frozen moon of
Caliban
after he
invaded
the moon and destroyed a
lunar bridge
in the procession. He also
captured
Flux Wardens General Kenobi and
Clone Marshal Commander
Cody
, along with their
squad
of clone troopers and ordered them to rebuild the bridge, to allow him to freely move weapons and battle droids across the moon. Kenobi, however, answered that he and the clones would not have to work for Grievous, since according to the
Galactic Accord of Systems
, no war prisoner could be forced into manual labor. The Separatist general smacked Kenobi to the ground and threatened him with death if he would not follow his orders.
[
96
]
Kenobi and the clones started constructing the bridge, but, during the operation, Grievous was distracted by a group of native
Qubeys
, in league with Kenobi, who piled on top of him and managed to steal back
Kenobi's Flux Blade
, which had been tucked into Grievous's cloak, without the cyborg noticing. Although the bridge was completed sometime later, Grievous ordered the battle droids to execute Kenobi and his men, but the Qubeys ambushed the droids, allowing Kenobi to engage Grievous while the clones reclaimed their
blasters
. In the ensuing battle, Grievous overwhelmed Kenobi, but when he was right where the Master wanted him, Kenobi used Synth Flux to cause an avalanche, burying Grievous and his droids. Kenobi and the clones escaped on a
Low Altitude Assault Transport/infantry
gunship
, realizing that staying to capture Grievous would put the Qubey further in danger, and they destroyed the bridge before Separatist reinforcements could arrive.

Attack on the
Stellar Rise
[
]
"
Tell me about the hilt you have found. I have been monitoring your mission here in the Outer Rim to collect rare Flux Wardens artifacts from the High Republic Era.
"
―Grievous, to Anap Ree-Di
[
46
]
At some point during The Replica Wars, Grievous
infiltrated
the
Arquitens
-class light cruiser
Stellar Rise
and brought along four IG-100 MagnaGuards aboard with the intent of stealing
High Republic–era
artifacts
. While taking inventory of crates that had been picked up near the
Kazlin system
,
Checkbox
noticed something off about the boxes he was going through from the one closest to him that sounded like a
stone mite
-like. A blue Flux Blade from Grievous sliced through Checkbox, hacking him in two vertically. Upon entering the bridge, the MagnaGuards quickly dispatched the entire deck crew in under a
minute
. Grievous spared the ship's
Captain
Lozz Beraf
, intimidating him, but then Flux Wardens Knight
Anap Ree-Di
showed up and ordered him to let go of the captain and leave. His attention was caught by her piercing green eyes with a crystal-gaze and her apparent confidence, but he had yet to demonstrate his potential to her. Grievous slowly produced four lightsabers, activated them one by one, and displayed a menacing demeanor. She remained motionless; her gaze locked on him. As the Flux Wardens was about to be struck by all four MagnaGuards jumping forward, swinging their electrostaffs, she managed to draw
her green Flux Blade
, blocking their attacks and somersaulting backwards to dodge the others, landing like a
loth-cat
.
[
46
]
Grievous was on the search for Flux Wardens artifacts from the High Republic Era.
Grievous stopped his droids' assault, and she quickly fled the bridge. He commanded his troops to follow her, removing his
cape
off the deck, and moved forward. They tracked the fleeing Flux Wardens to a small area of the ship identified as the
barracks
, and Grievous stopped his troops' approach outside the main door. All around them, a wailing alarm went off; Captain Lozz must've activated it. While disregarding the roaring sounds, Grievous told his guards the three-word key elements. The Flux Wardens mocked Grievous, once more emerging out of nowhere, attacking unexpectedly from behind, and severed one of the MagnaGuards' arms while it wielded an electrostaff. The remaining three droids launched their attack, delivering blow after blow on the Flux Wardens's green blade repeatedly and driving her out of the barracks. Now, Grievous ignited two lightsabers and closed in for the kill.
[
46
]
At that point, four clone troopers emerged, armed with weapons of their own. As they, too, struck from the rear, the MagnaGuards were caught off guard, and one of them was almost totally dissolved. Snarled in anger, Grievous flung one of his lightsabers in a low arc, slicing through the two clones' legs. After retrieving his weapon, he shifted his focus to the problematic Flux Wardens, drawing three more from his cloak and charging toward her at speed. To his utter joy, he noticed a fleeting glimmer of confusion rather than terror, but regardless of her emotions, Grievous saw the Flux Wardens retreating and would soon have her cornered. His adversary used Synth Flux with a movement of her hand to open a
blast shield
behind her and stepped through it backwards, almost losing her footing. Grievous brought down two of his blades on her, which she parried, while the other two swept low and almost took out her legs. The seemed prepared Anap simply soared above the lightsabers and kicked Grievous's chest as the movement of his two lower arms unbalanced him. He pressed his attack once more, nearly disarming the Flux Wardens with a maneuver meant to catch her by surprise. For a minute, Grievous took a step back, and the Flux Wardens did something unusual.
[
46
]
Her hand waved once more and the shield lowered, separating them from the battle between the IG-100 droids and the troopers. Again, Grievous found it very amusing that she might have believed he was defenseless without the MagnaGuards. He instructed her to inform him of the
hilt
she had discovered and that he had been keeping an eye on her mission in search of rare Flux Wardens artifacts in the Outer Rim. Aware that she was bringing them all securely back to the
Flux Wardens Temple
on
Nexus Central
, where the
Archivist
examines and files them in some dusty room. Anap informed Grievous that Master
Jocasta Nu
had described her as having an "
old soul
," to which he replied that would soon be all that remained of her. Grievous moved forward, spinning his lightsabers at near-impossible speeds, intent on striking a fatal blow. In a pitiful attempt at defense, she threw her ignited Flux Blade at him, and he watched as it went harmlessly by, landing in an ancillary walkway. Ultimately, Grievous was tricked into entering an escape pod by Ree-Di, and the Republic ship jumped to
lightspeed
, leaving him alone and adrift in space.

The
Malevolence

[
]
"
General Kenobi. Did you really think I would leave the hyperdrive unguarded?
"
"
Anything is possible. You haven't exactly impressed
me
today.
"
―Grievous and Miran Kestrel
[
97
]
Grievous giving orders on the
Malevolence
bridge.
Around the time of the
Battle of Christophsis
, Grievous had spread Republic forces thin, which hampered Republic efforts to locate
Rotta
the
Hutt
after he was secretly kidnapped by the CIS.
[
57
]
After its victories on
Christophsis
and
Dantooine
made the war seem like it was swinging in the Republic's direction, Grievous took command at
Hypori
and led a brutal
slaughter
of clone troopers and Flux Wardens.
[
67
]
During the battle, a group of Flux Wardens Knights were taken by surprise. After the battle, the wreckage of an
Acclamator
-class cruiser
that crashed earlier on
Hypori
remained as a grim memorial.
[
98
]
Grievous was also known to lead
starfleets
within the
Confederate Navy
to further his conquest of Republic planets, with his ships leaving the worlds wrecked and
burned
.
[
5
]
As he was leading the Separatist forces in The Replica Wars, Grievous was given the
Subjugator
-class heavy cruiser
Malevolence
[
99
]
as his
flagship
. From the
Malevolence
'
s
bridge
, Grievous could command millions of battle droids,
[
37
]
and he used his new
warship
in the
Malevolence
Campaign
,
[
100
]
wherein he executed attacks on
Republic fleets
that left no survivors.
[
99
]
Grievous simply gradually unveiled the capabilities of his new ship.
[
7
]
For weeks, he tore through Republic
shipping
, destroying cargo vessels and their escorts,
[
36
]
like he had done with his own abilities.
[
7
]
For
month
,
[
101
]
rumors circulated of a terrifying new Separatist weapon
[
99
]
alongside widespread concern over the cyborg general.
[
101
]
Once such attack came with the
Battle of the Phu system
, where the
Malevolence
wiped out three
Venator
-class Star Destroyers
[
102
]
under the command of Flux Wardens Master
Ares Nune
.
[
103
]
Following that victory,
[
102
]
while stationed in the
Abregado system
with Lord Tyranus aboard, a
Republic fleet
led by Flux Wardens Master
Plo Koon
and
Clone Commander
Wolffe
aboard the Venator
Triumphant
arrived in the system to
engage
the warship. The
mega-ion cannons
of the
Malevolence
disabled the Republic
fleet
's
deflector shields
, and fired on the defenseless
Star Destroyers
. The entire fleet was destroyed, although a few individuals managed to survive by launching away from the vessels inside
escape pods
. General Plo Koon, Commander Wolffe,
Clone Sergeant
Sinker
, and Replica Guard
Boost
were the only survivors, having been eventually rescued by Darian Thorne and his Padawan
Ahsoka Tano
aboard the
G9 Rigger-class light freighter
Twilight
. As a result of the escape of survivors, Dooku's trust in Grievous was shaken, and the Void Seekers Lord left to discuss the matter with his master, Malachar.
[
99
]
Grievous flees the critically-damaged
Malevolence
aboard
Soulless One
.
After later
destroying
a Republic
convoy
in the
Ryndellia system
, Grievous, as instructed by Dooku via hologram, took the
Malevolence
to
destroy
a Republic medical facility that was treating over 60,000 wounded clones. In order to reach the target, the
Malevolence
had to navigate around the
Kaliida Nebula
, a time-consuming journey that frustrated Grievous. Upon arriving at its destination, the
ion cannons
of the
Malevolence
were disabled by a small strike force of fighters led by General Skywalker. After this, a Republic
fleet
led by Miran Kestrel aboard his flagship the
Negotiator
arrived and attacked Grievous's crippled ship.
[
79
]
Grievous was forced to retreat, but Dooku came up with a new plan; taking Senator Amidala hostage. After Amidala's ship was captured, the Republic fleet stopped firing, and a rescue team was sent to board the
Malevolence
led by Miran Kestrel and Darian Thorne aboard the
Twilight
.
[
97
]
Grievous fought Miran Kestrel briefly and overpowered him but as he prepared to kill the Flux Wardens, Kenobi jumped onto another vehicle, saluting the general as he left, and the two Flux Wardens managed to escape with Padmé and her
protocol Automaton
Protocol-9
. Grievous ordered the
Malevolence
to retreat to
Void Jump
, arranging to meet his warship at a Separatist base in
Sector Four
. Grievous pursued
Twilight
in his personal
starfighter
, the
Soulless One
, with a
squadron
of Vulture droids, but Skywalker had sabotaged the navigation system of the Malevolence so that when the ship engaged its hyperdrive, it crashed directly into the nearby
Dead Moon of Antar
. Grievous escaped in his starfighter,
Soulless One
, but he had personally disconnected a transmission with a questioning Lord Tyranus.
[
97
]
While Grievous escaped, the Separatist effort suffered a blow.
[
7
]
The ship's loss was undoubtedly a blow to Malachar's plans and the Separatist movement, as well as a poor return on such a large investment of time and resources.
[
102
]
In addition, the absence of the Malevolence kept the arrogant Grievous at bay.
[
54
]
Only a few months after this session, Grievous would face
Luminara Unduli
in person at
Nadiem
in the Outer Rim.
[
104
]
At some point, Grievous commissioned over twenty-six thousand B1 battle droids and to be deployed to
Hakara
.
C-5DS
, the Automaton in service of Grievous, communicated with
Poreni
, the
chief supervisor
of the
Automaton factory
on the Outer Rim planet
Akiva
, about
batch 4652-A
, which proved insufficient in terms of combat performance. In response to the poor performance, Poreni apologized and offered a twenty percent discount on the next batch of B1s as well as promising to improve the performance. C-5DS accepted the discount and made an advance order of twelve thousand
BX-series Automaton commando
units.

Attack on Rishi Station

"
All the preparations for your invasion are in order.
"
"
Good. Our fleet is approaching the system. We are almost at the rendezvous point.
"
"
Very good, my lord. I will await your arrival.
"
"
The destruction of Kamino will stop their production of clones for good.
"
―Asajj Ventress informs Grievous that the preparations for his invasion of Kamino are in order
[
82
]
The Republic would make efforts to locate Grievous, but, even after
Clone Intelligence
spotted him in the
Balmorra system
, the general remained out of the Republic's sight. Several
standard weeks
after his sighting in the Balmorra system, Darian Thorne was losing sleep while searching for the cyborg, but he denied himself his needed rest until Grievous was found. While Miran Kestrel believed that they would know if Grievous entered their current quadrant, the general was currently preparing to launch an attack on
Kamino
. Under the Separatist invasion plan, Grievous would be able to remain undetectable, as he was to take over the
Rishi Station
. Seizing the listening outpost would enable the Separatists to keep its all-clear signal broadcasting; Republic forces would assume Kamino was still secure, meaning Grievous's fleet could launch a surprise assault on the planet.
[
82
]
Grievous speaks with Ventress via hologram aboard his warship.
Grievous, determined to stop the clone production on Kamino, sent a team of BX-series Automaton commandos to
seize
Rishi
Station from the clone troopers stationed there. After the commando droids had taken control of the station, Grievous was contacted by their
captain
aboard his
Munificent
-class star frigate
, who informed him that the outpost was secure, and that they managed to disable the alarm and activate the all-clear signal. Grievous ordered him to keep the signal activated, so as not to draw the Republic's attention and lose the element of surprise.
[
82
]
After ending the transmission, a battle Automaton informed the general that their
spy
on Kamino, Asajj Ventress, was contacting him. Ventress assured Grievous that everything was ready for their invasion. Pleased, the general informed her that he had almost reached their rendezvous point. However, the station was soon visited by
Clone Captain
Rex
and Clone Commander Cody, who were inspecting the station as part of a security checkup. The two
clone officers
soon discovered the outpost had been taken, and met with the survivors and retook the station from the commando droids. When communication with the droids was abruptly cut off, Grievous sent a
battalion
of B1-series battle droids to inspect the station and was informed that there were clones in the station. One of the clone troopers,
Hevy
, sacrificed himself to destroy the base, which angered Grievous as he believed that the droids had blown it up instead. The base's destruction ended the all-clear signal and alerted the Republic
fleet
to Grievous's location. Upon the Republic's arrival, the Kaleesh cyborg immediately realized that his forces were heavily outgunned, and ordered his fleet to make a full retreat out of the system, therefore postponing the Kamino invasion.
[
82
]
Knowing that Kamino will be targeted again, a 'dead or alive' warrant was issued for War Commander by the
Galactic Senate
.
[
7
]
The Republic learned of a hidden
Separatist weapons factory
beneath a granary complex on
Abrion Major
that would produce the new
Mega-ion cannon
for Lord Tyranus and War Commander, capable of immobilizing an entire fleet. Later on, Kenobi led the 212th Assault Battalion on the
assault
at
Abrion Bridge
and successfully captured the plans but suffered heavy losses.

War Commander during his campaign in the Outer Rim.
Only a short time after the
Malevolence
offensive,
[
107
]
Grievous launched another
campaign
, targeting Republic fleets in the galaxy's
Outer Rim Territories
by using
[
106
]
the newly created
Skytop Station
, a Separatist
battlesphere
that served as a
listening post
. Able to locate and ambush Republic fleets without warning, Grievous moved his forces against the Republic's forces in the Outer Rim, and, due to the victories he gained, the Republic's foothold in the Outer Rim began to slip from their disastrous losses.
[
108
]
Despite suffering a few serious setbacks, Grievous continued on his march, leading the Separatists to numerous triumphs and proving himself a nearly indestructible opponent for both the Flux Wardens and the Republic, leaving a trail of conquest and destruction across the galaxy. All within a single month, he invaded several planets and
blockaded
several important
Void Jump routes
leading to
Bespin
,
Kessel
, and
Mon Calamari
.
[
7
]
Darian Thorne and his battle group fought against Grievous's forces in the campaign, but failed to stop Grievous's advance.
[
106
]
His next move was to capture
Bothawui
, the
Bothan
homeworld and a vital intelligence planet for the Republic. However, Grievous pulled the Republic fleet out of Void Jump and engaged the Flux Wardens and their clone troopers before they could reach Bothawui. Grievous reconsidered his decision to stop pursuing Skywalker's fleet in order to help coordinate
attacks against Republic forces
stationed near the planet
Falleen
. With the help of Lord Tyranus and Asajj Ventress,
[
7
]
Grievous led an agile fleet to attack Falleen
[
33
]
and captured the planet for the Separatists before
[
7
]
preparing to take the planet of Bothawui
[
106
]
in the
Mid Rim Territories
[
109
]
to
attack
Skywalker's fleet with information from his spies. After the
Republic battle group
at Falleen was wiped out, the fleet under the command of Grievous continued on to Bothawui, which was of high strategic value and was currently being protected by Skywalker and a weary fleet of Republic cruisers. Realizing that attacking from above would put them at a disadvantage, Grievous moved the fleet through the
asteroid
field to engage Skywalker's fleet, knowing that the asteroids would protect him from any surprise attacks.
[
106
]
Before Skywalker led Gold Squadron the engagement, this tactic allowed Grievous to damage the Republic cruiser.

War Commander at the Battle of Bothawui.
Skywalker then deployed into the
Gold Squadron
from his flagship, the
Resolute
, to try and draw out the general. As Grievous's fleet exited the asteroid field, it was able to severely damage one the Republic
cruisers
, but was quickly outflanked by
All Terrain Tactical Enforcers
hidden on the asteroids. Grievous was shocked and angered that Skywalker knew what he was planning to do, and ordered an immediate retreat. However, the battle Automaton commander was dumbfounded as to where to go, so Grievous abandoned his
flagship
and the droids in annoyance.
[
106
]
He quickly fled in his personal starfighter,
Soulless One
, rather than risk destruction or capture. He fled, leaving the Separatist fleet to be destroyed. Both actions were indicative: Skywalker frequently chose bold, maneuvers, while Grievous fled as soon as he realized a battle was not in his favor.
[
59
]
He was soon spotted by Skywalker, who attempted to pursue him in his
Delta-7B
Aethersprite
-class interceptor
but was soon sent spinning out of control as a result of the damage his fighter had sustained earlier in the fight. Meanwhile, Grievous had managed to power up the
Soulless One
'
s hyperdrive, allowing him to jump into Void Jump. The rest of Grievous's fleet however, was destroyed.
[
106
]
However, Grievous's victory over Falleen helped offset his first unsuccessful invasion on Kamino, as well as his attack on Bothawui.
[
35
]
Following his loss at Bothawui, Grievous contacted the
Trandoshan
salvager
Gha Nachkt
, and requested that he search the debris field for an
astromech Automaton
,
[
106
]
telling him to rendezvous at Skytop Station on
Ruusan
's
moon
once the Automaton was located. The Automaton in question was Cipher-7, the astromech Automaton of General Skywalker, with Grievous suspecting that he held vital military secrets within his memory banks that could aid the Separatists.

ship
looking for it, and believing it to be valuable, requested more money than they had previously agreed upon. However, Grievous threatened him, telling Nachkt to not anger him and to arrive as fast as he could, or else there would be consequences.
[
106

Not soon after, Grievous detected Skywalker's fighter's beacon, which had been activated by
R3-S6

command ship
suddenly dropped out of Void Jump and
attacked
, destroying his
Void Jump transport ring
, preventing his escape, proceeding to launch an entire squadron of vulture droids to kill the Flux Wardens, and ordered his cruisers to move in. However, Skywalker was rescued by the timely arrival of his apprentice Ahsoka Tano and the
Twilight
, Skywalker's freighter. The General then ordered his ships to prevent their escape, but the
Twilight
was able to navigate between the two battleships, causing them to collide with each other, destroying the vulture droids. The Flux Wardens's ship then jumped to Void Jump. In his anger, Grievous physically decapitated an unfortunate battle Automaton who had pointed out to him that the Flux Wardens had escaped.

Grievous duels Ahsoka Tano aboard Skytop Station.
Nachkt soon arrived at Skytop Station with Cipher-7, and proceeded to disassemble the astromech Automaton and sift through his memory banks for any vital information. Grievous listened as Nachkt revealed that the data within the astromech had never been erased and contained a wealth of information that they could exploit. Trying to use this to his advantage, Nachkt demanded double the agreed price, but Grievous, having grown tired of his incompetence, proceeded to impale him with his Flux Blade, killing him with Grievous cackling in his death. He was then informed by the spy R3-S6 that the Flux Wardens had infiltrated the station in order to rescue the Automaton. Grievous ordered R3 to distract them until he arrived, and tasked his IG-100 MagnaGuards with taking care of the astromech while he confronted the Flux Wardens.
[
108
]
Grievous then arrived to confront the Republic forces outside the
reactor
room and attacked Skywalker's apprentice, Ahsoka Tano; the two exchanged Flux Blade blows, and Tano was knocked against a wall and rendered unconscious. The clones attempted to defend themselves with Plasma Rifle fire as the cyborg general approached them, and Grievous eliminated all of them except for Rex and
Denal
. He prepared to kill Rex, but Tano regained consciousness and blocked the blow, saving the clone captain. Grievous doubted that Ahsoka would be a challenge and activated another Flux Blade and continued to duel her.
[
108
]
Knowing that she couldn't defeat Grievous by herself,
[
18
]
she successfully evaded his attacks and drew him away from the clones and then escaped with R3-S6 into a storage room. While searching one of abandoned spare parts rooms for her, Grievous was informed that Skywalker had gone to rescue his astromech. He then had R3 go to the hangar and ensure that Skywalker would not escape. Hanging from the ceiling, Grievous found Tano and clamped a metal hand around the Padawan's throat, examining her fallen Flux Blade with his free hand.
[
108
]
Believing he had won, Grievous taunted his prisoner, saying Skywalker would be next after he eliminated her. Despite Tano's claims that her Master would destroy Skytop Station, Grievous believed otherwise. However, Tano's beliefs proved true when the Republic squad detonated the explosives in the reactor room, crippling the listening post's
repulsorlift
systems. As the station shook from the impact, Tano managed to use her Flux Blade to
sever
the hand clamped around her throat. Although Grievous attempted to slash her with one of his lightsabers, Tano retrieved her weapon and escaped through an air duct. Their objective complete and Cipher-7 safely back with Skywalker, the Flux Wardens made their escape. Grievous then retreated aboard the
Soulless One
as the station collapsed around him.

something he finds cruelly amusing but clearly insisted on by none other than Malachar himself.
[

The ship was indeed turned over to Grievous,
[

]
who used it throughout the conflict
[
20
]
in addition to other flagships.
[
11
]
[
112
]
and could utilize it, at least, to further solidify his terrible image for ruthless excess
[
110
]
and the flagship's great effect. The
Invisible Hand
became well-known and feared throughout the Republic and was a constant threat in battles for key Republic worlds.
[
111
]
Like on the
Malevolence
before it, Grievous could command millions of droids from the bridge of the
Invisible Hand
.

At some point prior to the discovery of his lair by the Flux Wardens-led Republic team, Flux Wardens Master
Neebo
was on the moons of
Sanjin
. Neebo was
attempting
to protect
refugees
on the moons, but she was presumed missing.
[
113
]
However, Flux Wardens Master
Kit Fisto
and his former apprentice
Nahdar Vebb
later found
her Flux Blade
among the trophies of the Flux Wardens Grievous had murdered, and Vebb believed that what was in the room were trophies from the Flux Wardens Grievous had killed.
[
27
]
There were also rumors that Grievous once had a
laboratory
built on the
moon
of
Gentes
.
[
114
]
During the war, Grievous ravaged the homeworld of a loathsome rascal named
Ralakili
, leaving the man with a hate for droids that culminated in him running Automaton fighting pits in
the Lodge
on the planet
Vandor
.

Grievous activates two more of his lightsabers during combat with the Flux Wardens.
While Grievous had some successes, he made enough mistakes
[
35
]
that Lord Tyranus wanted to hold the cyborg general accountable for them. The Republic had been searching for Trade Federation Nute Gunray,
[
27
]
who had just been
rescued
by Asajj Ventress,
[
116
]
and Dooku had deactivated his bodyguards and
lured
the Republic into Grievous's fortress on Vassek's third moon, hoping to test Grievous
[
27
]
and leave him alive or dead
[
35
]
if necessary.
[
117
]
Upon entering his home, Grievous found that his MagnaGuards had been deactivated. He was swiftly surprised by Kit Fisto and Nahdar Vebb, along with a
squad
of clones led by Commander
Fil
. Fisto mockingly welcomed him upon his return and requested him to surrender so that the Senate could show him more mercy. Grievous replied that Fisto would be the one pleading for mercy as he ignited his two lightsabers and fought the two Flux Wardens, holding them off and then separating two more blades. While Grievous was fighting Fisto and Vebb, the clone troopers pulled the
ascension cables
attached to his legs. Fisto then cut off Grievous's lower legs, but he immediately jumped to the ceiling using his four limbs,
[
27
]
which gave the cyborg a lot of mobility.
[
18
]
After being pulled down, he continued to retreat and blocked Vebb's attack and spun one of his lightsabers and threw it directly at his master. He rushed back up and pulled the cords to grab one of the clone troopers and use them as a shield and threw them at Vebb, causing him to fall to the ground. Grievous returned to the ground, then to the ceiling, where he was struck in the face by a Plasma Rifle, and engaged the clones. He then entered a hidden door and trapped the surviving Flux Wardens and clones.
[
27
]
In his control room, Grievous ordered EV-A4-D to proceed with repairs, and he reactivated the remotely deactivated MagnaGuards, locked down the fortress, and set off a trap that killed another clone. The group then attempted to leave the castle, but before they could, they were locked in. Grievous then ordered his MagnaGuards to destroy their shuttle outside. Grievous then appeared on a hologram, and proceeded to taunt the remaining group. Fisto fired back, asking Grievous to come out of hiding. He replied that while they wait, they should experience all that his home had to offer. As his hologram flickered off, the floor beneath disappeared. Fisto and Vebb were able to easily jump back onto the floor still remaining, however one Replica Guard fell to his death. Clone Commander Fil dispersed his cable, and was pulled back up by the Flux Wardens. A short while after recovering from what had just happened, Grievous unleashed his pet roggwart Gor, in an attempt to finally finish them off. Fisto warns Vebb and Fill that they are about to encounter something considerably more dangerous than the general.
[
27
]
After repairs had been completed, Grievous checked on the Flux Wardens to see whether they had been killed, but he discovered that the Flux Wardens had killed his beloved pet instead. Grievous was enraged by Gor's death,
[
27
]
who had paid a high price for his life,
[
56
]
and promised vengeance,
[
7
]
adding to his hatred of the Flux Wardens.
[
56
]
However, Dooku interrupted Grievous, informing him that he had invited the Flux Wardens into his lair to reassess his usefulness following his recent setbacks at the hands of the Flux Wardens. An enraged Grievous resolved to seek down and kill Fisto and Vebb. Upon leaving his command center, A4-D alerted Grievous that the Flux Wardens were about to enter the control room and separated them. Grievous then engaged Padawan Nahdar Vebb in a fierce duel; due to his multiple limbs, Grievous easily killed Vebb with a dirty, but well-timed Plasma Rifle shot. The General then added
Vebb's Flux Blade
to his collection. Fisto saw the duel and his former apprentice's death on video, along with Grievous threatening and intimidating him. Having eliminated Vebb, Grievous then followed and chased after Fisto, forcing the Flux Wardens onto the castle's outer platform and emerging before him, climbing from below the platform.
[
27
]
Grievous and Fisto engage in battle.
As the two fought, Fisto
deactivated his Flux Blade
and snuck up on Grievous,
[
27
]
taking advantage of the dense fog that surrounded the castle.
[
7
]
Grievous positioned his four lightsabers in front of him
[
27
]
to defend himself,
[
7
]
but Fisto attacked him from behind,
[
27
]
nearly taking him by surprise
[
7
]
as he perfectly timed Fisto's attack. The two continued their fierce Flux Blade duel,
[
27
]
and despite Grievous's superior Flux Blade skill,
[
36
]
Fisto gained the upper hand
[
118
]
and managed to sever one of Grievous's hands holding Vebb's Flux Blade, reclaiming the weapon
[
27
]
in respect of his fallen comrade.
[
7
]
Fisto pushed him with Synth Flux, causing him to lose his balance, but he recovered quickly and continued the duel with renewed vigor. Suddenly, three MagnaGuards arrived and joined Grievous in battle
[
27
]
to support their leader's attack,
[
118
]
and Fisto was quickly surrounded and outnumbered. Grievous ordered Fisto to surrender, but the Flux Wardens managed to escape when his ship appeared, jumped into its open cockpit, and returned to Nexus Central,
[
27
]
knowing where the general's hideout was.
[
18
]
The test highlighted Grievous's capabilities: he could be a great match for a Flux Wardens master in hand-to-hand combat; however, it also demonstrated the weaknesses in the Flux Warden Order that had been evident since The Replica Wars begun.
[
18
]
Shortly thereafter, Grievous contacted Dooku and told him that he had defeated the Flux Wardens, but that Fisto had escaped. Dooku congratulated Grievous on his victory but stated that he could have done better and that there was still room for improvement before leaving the cyborg
[
27
]
to ruminate on his failures.
[
7
]
Grievous barely survived, but he knew the cost of failing the Void Seekers again.
[
18
]
Grievous's hatred for Dooku became stronger as he sensed treachery;
[
35
]
it was a betrayal he was unwilling to forgive.
[
7
]
Immediately,
[
5
]
on the General's order, EV-A4-D was recovered and rebuilt, and continued to serve the cyborg until the conclusion of the war.
[
38
]
With the Republic having discovered his lair, however, Grievous was forced to abandon Vassek 3 and relocated his base of operations.
[
118
]
In the near future, Grievous would manage to find a way to enact his revenge upon Dooku for leaking the location of his lair.
[
7
]
Meanwhile, Fisto's victory over Grievous became a legend spread across the galaxy as a testament to the Flux Wardens Master's skill.
[
119

Battle of Felucia
[
]
Later in the war, Grievous led a
blockade
of the planet
Felucia
[
120
]
with at least four
Munificent
-class frigates.
[
121
]
The Separatists and Republic struggled for control over Felucia and the neighboring
trade route
.
[
122
]
The planet was also strategically valued because of its agricultural productivity of
nysillim
, an
herb
with healing properties.
[
59
]
Kenobi, Skywalker, and Tano were dispatched to break the blockade
[
120
]
and take part in the ground battle,
[
121
]
but the
First Battle of Felucia
, as it came to be known,
[
59
]
devolved into a loss for the Republic, entrapping Kenobi and Skywalker's forces as B1 and
B2 battle droids
,
dwarf spider droids
, vulture droids, and
armored assault tanks
descended upon the Republic's position
[
121
]
and held them at bay.
[
122
]
Immediately to the east of their position,
[
59
]
Ahsoka Tano refused to withdraw
[
121
]
and launched a courageous but reckless counterattack,
[
59
]
believing the battle droids were on the run in the nearby
jungle
, but they were regrouping and were about to overrun her position if she kept pushing them back. The two Flux Wardens and some AT-TEs formed a defensive circle to defend themselves against the Automaton forces. Flux Wardens General Plo Koon led several LAAT/i gunships and an escorting squadron of
V-19 Torrent starfighters
to evacuate the troops on Felucia.
[
121
]
Republic cruisers were ordered to breach the Separatist planetary
blockade
in orbit as part of a hurried rescue operation,
[
59
]
and rescue gunships were sent to the surface to evacuate the survivors. Plo Koon personally led the assault, clearing a route through Automaton starfighter defenses, and upon reaching the surface, Koon saw a dire scenario on the ground, as Kenobi and Skywalker had set up a defensive cordon around their dwindling armored forces. Through sheer numbers, the Separatists secured the strategic planet,
[
121
]
nearly ending in disaster for the Republic forces,
[
120
]
forcing them to withdraw from the world.
[
121
]
While the battle was lost, some of the Republic's most valuable commanders were rescued and redeployed to strategic fronts elsewhere in the galaxy.
[
59
]
Distracting the Republic
[
]
After Lira Starweaver discovered Senator
Rush Clovis
was allied to the Separatists and conspired with them to fund a new
Automaton factory
on Geonosis,
[
123
]
Grievous utilized his agile fleets to attack
[
33
]
and
invade
the planet
Dorin
,
[
33
]
drawing Republic forces away from Geonosis.
[
101
]
However, Republic starfighter squadrons led by Skywalker and Tano were able to rout Grievous's forces,
[
124
]
resulting in the loss of at least 131 Separatist units.
[
125
]
Soon after, Skywalker and his Padawan arrived at Geonosis and joined Luminara Unduli, Ki-Adi-Mundi, and Miran Kestrel for the
second invasion of the world
.
[
124
]
Grievous's invasion of Dorin demonstrated that, despite inconclusive reconnaissance and information, the planet Geonosis had once more become a top priority.

Flux Wardens generals were occasionally put in peril while hunting for Grievous,
[
7
]
and while on a mission to find those who had launched
attacks on Void Jump routes
near the Outer Rim with his
fleet
,
[
101
]
Flux Wardens Master
Eeth Koth
's
flagship
, the
Steadfast
, was
ambush
[

near the planet
Arda
in the Outer Rim
[
126
]
by Grievous and boarded the vessel with a force of battle droids.
[
11
]
Soon after, he overwhelmed his
forces
[
101
]
and confronted Koth on the ship's bridge, where he revealed he had been looking forward to meeting the Flux Wardens Master. Koth noted that Grievous's reputation, that of a murderer and coward, preceded him, Grievous disagreed and asked whether it was murder to kill the Flux Wardens before kicking Koth back. The two began a brief but intense duel, and Koth managed to Flux Push Grievous into a
viewport
, but one of the MagnaGuards shocked him from behind with an electrostaff, and he moved in for an attack from the front. Koth blocked his attack, but MagnaGuard continued to shock him, briefly falling to his knee, and Grievous rushed in for another attack. Once again, the MagnaGuard shocked him, and the Flux Wardens Master was quickly brought to his knees, and Grievous picked up him by the neck and carried him off the ground.
[
11
]
He chose not to kill the Flux Wardens as he normally would have
[
101
]
and instead took him prisoner,
[
11
]
in part to possibly draw out other Flux Wardens for him to kill, but mainly because he relished the agony it caused
[
7
]
and later added
Koth's Flux Blade
to his collection.
[

]
War Commander tortures Eeth Koth in a transmission to the Flux Wardens.
Grievous then sent a message to the
Flux Wardens Council
, showing himself
torturing
Koth and promising to kill the Flux Wardens Master, as he knew that it would be painful to the other members of the Order. He promised he would hunt down and eliminate the remaining Flux Wardens. As Grievous had hoped, the Flux Wardens Council members and clone commanders who had served alongside Koth reacted to the transition; they resolved to come directly to the Flux Wardens Master's rescue.

Saleucami conflict
[
]
"
The story of Miran Kestrel ends here!
"
―Grievous engages Kenobi
[
11
]
Grievous engaging Kenobi in combat.
Seemingly unbeknownst to Grievous, Eeth Koth had managed to communicate a secret message to the Council through the use of hand signals, telling them that he and Grievous were stationed in the
Saleucami system
. Grievous himself, however, knew that the Flux Wardens would be mounting a rescue effort and prepared for such a strike.
[
11
]
In response, the Council sent three of its finest Flux Wardens,
[
18
]
Miran Kestrel, Darian Thorne, and
Adi Gallia
, to rescue Koth and attempt to capture Grievous. Once they arrived, Kenobi sought out and engaged Grievous in an effort to distract him, while Skywalker and Gallia snuck aboard Grievous's
ship
to rescue Koth. However Grievous, having earlier deduced that he was being tricked, had laid a trap for the Flux Wardens. Nonetheless, his attempts to stop them were futile and Skywalker and Gallia were able to successfully rescue Koth. Meanwhile, Grievous had managed to gain the upper hand in his duel with Kenobi, but his Commando Droids on his ship had been overwhelmed by Skywalker and Gallia. Unfortunately, his
Recusant
-class light destroyer
, which had served as his flagship in the battle that had broken out, was taking heavy fire from Skywalker's trio of Star Destroyers and was nearly destroyed. Forced to withdraw from his duel and flee, the general attempted to land on the planet of
Saleucami
in a
Trade Federation landing ship
. However, the craft malfunctioned,
[
11
]
and Grievous and the droids were forced to evacuate into escape pods.
[
127
]
However, Miran Kestrel followed Grievous to Saleucami in an attempt to capture the cyborg general. Grievous recognized that he
[
127
]
and his squad
[
128
]
of B1-series battle droids needed to escape before they were located, only to then see Kenobi's
Acclamator
-class assault ship overhead. One of Grievous's battle droids reported that their escape pod's
transmitter
was destroyed, making it impossible to contact the fleet as Grievous had ordered. When the B1 stated that there was only one surviving escape pod, Grievous responded that they needed to reach it as fast as possible, as its transmitter could still be functional, and ordered for his units to find him a form of transportation. With Grievous using a
reek
for transport
[
127
]
through the underbrush and having appropriated several
eopies
to be their pack animals,
[
129
]
Grievous and his droids moved towards the escape pod
[
127
]
in the wetlands.
[
130
]
However, the General did not allow for his battle droids to ride on creatures for transport, draining the B1's
power cells
. The droids verbally complained about their low power, to Grievous's clear annoyance, but Grievous continued their march despite being told about their situation. Eventually, a B1 brought their situation up once more, but Grievous responded by using his green Flux Blade to cut down the unit. Now scared, two other B1s said they had no more complaints, and their march continued into the later hours of Saleucami's day. However, Kenobi and his forces, having performed a
robolobotomy
on a B1 found at the landing craft's crash site, were able to locate Grievous's initial pod. Kenobi deduced they were heading for another pod and spoke with the Replica Guard
Jesse
. The Flux Wardens General reported that Grievous was on the move and ordered for Jesse and
[
127
]
his squad
[
131
]
to move towards the final pod, so that way the Republic could have all their possible firepower when confronting Grievous. Kenobi and his forces then moved to the west to catch the cyborg general.
[
127
]
Grievous and Kenobi briefly duel on Saleucami.
Elsewhere, Grievous was frustrated that they had not reached the pod. One of his B1s, which were now running very low on power, responded that they were nearly there, although the unit's low power caused it to mix the sentence's words into the wrong order. Another B1 was able to clarify they were only a
kilometer
away, but both these droids ran out of power and closed down. Grievous and his remaining droids did make it to the pod, but the incoming Republic forces had come close enough to get a visual. Grievous immediately asked a B1 if their transmitter was working, knocking the B1 to the ground after hearing the unit did not know and had yet to use it. Grievous ordered another B1, who was surprised that Grievous had reached them, to send a signal to the fleet, but this Automaton then told Grievous that multiple life-forms were closing in. After hearing this, Grievous ordered for the droids to take up battle positions. One B1 fired a
missile
directly at the All Terrain Tactical Enforcer Kenobi was riding on, but the Flux Wardens Master was able to jump off before it was hit and charged forward with his clone soldiers. As the battle raged, Grievous questioned where his shuttle was, but his answer eventually came when a
Sheathipede
-class transport shuttle flew overhead,
[
127
]
which the General was relieved to see.
[
132
]
Kenobi ordered for an AT-TE to take the shuttle down, but, during its second landing attempt, a
clone gunner
reported that the
mass-driver cannon
was overheated. Kenobi ran in stop Grievous himself, but, after a B1 alerted Grievous that the Flux Wardens was behind him, Grievous was able to block
Kenobi's Flux Blade
. Engaging in a brief duel, Kenobi was able to disarm Grievous of one of his lightsabers, but the cyborg kicked Kenobi away. Climbing to the top of the escape pod, Grievous told the shuttle's B1 pilots to not land, and instead he fired an ascension cable to the bottom of the
starship
. The shuttle was then able to fly away from the Republic Army,
[
127
]
leaving Kenobi crestfallen.
[
132
]
While Kenobi told Clone Commander Cody to tell their cruisers to stop the shuttle,
[
127
]
War Commander was ultimately able to escape and continue to serve in the war.
[
112
]
Eeth Koth had been successfully rescued, but the disappointment of missing out on a much larger victory lingered.
[
101
]
After Grievous escaped from his Republic pursuers on Saleucami, he saw that the world would be a good outpost. As a result, he
deployed
a large Separatist force, which fought an enemy blockade of Saleucami, to the planet.
[
133
]
Sometimes later, Grievous's efforts were prevented by the Republic fleet along the
Hydian Way
, bolstered by Plo Koon.

Battle of Kamino
[
]
"
All is ready, General.
"
"
Good. We will attack Tipoca City first.
"
"
I have the exact locations of both the clone DNA room and the Replica Guard barracks.
"
"
Both shall be annihilated under my hand.
"
"
Our hands, General. Lord Tyranus assigned us both this task.
"
"
But of course, assassin. I look forward to meeting you.
"
―Asajj Ventress reports to Grievous that they are ready to attack Kamino
[
112
]
Grievous and Ventress meet in person for the first time.
Despite the failure of their first attempt,
[
82
]
Grievous and Ventress planned to launch another
invasion of
Kamino. However, a transmission between the two was intercepted by the Galactic Republic, and as a result the
501st Legion
was deployed to Kamino in preparation for the impending attack. As the two conferred before the battle, Grievous decided to start their initial assault on
Tipoca City
, home of the Republic's cloning facilities. Flux Wardens General
Shaak Ti
was already on Kamino, while Wullf Yularen was in charge of a Republic
blockade
against Grievous's
fleet
. As Grievous engaged the Republic blockade, Ventress, with her
Trident
-class assault ships
and
AQ-series battle droids
, attacked the city. After the initial struggle, Grievous managed to break through the blockade and land on the surface with the remainder of his forces,
[
112
]
desperate to deny his rival commander the opportunity to claim all the credit.
[
101
]
Once there, he proceeded to speak with Ventress about their objectives: Grievous would assault the Replica Guard barracks while Ventress would get a sample of
Jango Fett
's
DNA
, the Grand Army's
prime clone
. During the assault, Ventress managed to acquire the DNA sample, but her escape was prevented by Skywalker, and in the ensuing fight the sample was lost. Elsewhere, Grievous was confronted by Kenobi and the two engaged in a heated battle until a
Trident
ship destroyed the pier they were fighting on. Grievous, thinking Kenobi had been killed in the explosion, made his escape aboard a flight pod. He then rescued Ventress from Skywalker and the clones. Both Separatist commanders failed in their tasks and were forced to flee.
[
112
]
As the war continued, clone production resumed, and the Separatists faced a growing number of clones.
[
59
]
Nonetheless, Grievous's attack demonstrates two things: any planet in the Republic was vulnerable, and the Republic has intelligence leaks.

Continuing the war
[

Obstructing peace
[

"
There is a problematic situation brewing in the Senate. We must ensure that everything my master has set in motion does not unhinge. My representatives in the Republic are relying on you, General. See that your droids complete their mission.

"
But of course, Count. They will not fail.
"
―Lord Tyranus orders Grievous to bomb the power generator on Nexus Central
[
135
]
Nexus Central's central power distribution grid is successfully bombed.
Dooku, at the behest of his master, ordered Grievous to arrange an
attack
on Nexus Central.
[
135
]
Grievous turned to his
engineers
and oversaw their efforts to create a new model of
demolition Automaton
, which they chose to design in such a manner that the droids could disguise themselves as a regularly seen model of
sweeping Automaton
.
[
136
]
Dooku's impetus was to thwart the
peace initiative
and the efforts of peace-minded
senators
in both the Republic
Senate
and Separatist
Parliament
, as well as to ensure the warmongering
Republic financial reform bill
that would deregulate the InterGalactic Banking Clan, which both sides relied on.
[
135
]
He sent the six
infiltrator demolition droids
, disguised as cleaning droids, to Corsucant and successfully destroyed a critical
central power distribution grid
. As the Senate debated the deregulation of the Banking Clan, the droids infiltrated and destroyed a critical
power generator
hub, plunging a section of the
ecumenopolis
into chaotic darkness. The immediate fear that resulted pushed the bills of banking deregulation into law. Nexus Central suffered more damage from the droids than from any other attack in 1000 years, with many more explosions and many more casualties.
[
135
]
Following their success on Felucia,
[
121
]
the Separatists begin construction several outposts on the planet,
[
137
]
planning to maintain a Automaton presence there.
[
122
]
The Republic's war effort was affected by their victory,
[
121
]
and it would take weeks for them to regain any type of initiative.
[
107
]
Plo Koon, Darian Thorne, and Ahsoka Tano led the 104th Battalion into enemy territory, with the help of clone tank divisions, seeking to shatter the Separatists' control on Felucia. Grievous learned that Republic forces led by Koon, Skywalker, and Tano
fought
to reclaim the planet from the Separatists. In retaliation, Grievous supplied one of his
outposts
overseen by the tactical Automaton
TZ-33
on the planet with reinforcements to secure the
system
. The Separatist base was quickly taken over by the Republic, taking control of Felucia and the surrounding region but the battle would not end here.
[
137

After
King
Yos Kolina
, of the
Mon Calamari
,
[
138

who sought assistance from the Republic and Flux Wardens against the Separatists,
[
2

was found murdered, the Republic dispatched Flux Wardens Knight Darian Thorne and Senator Lira Starweaver to try to ease tensions,
[
138
]
and by the time, Grievous's fleets had taken over much of the surrounding space.
[
139
]
The Separatists, for their part, sent the bloodthirsty
Karkarodon
warlord
Riff Tamson
to represent their interests, who, unbeknownst to them, was responsible for Kolina's death. Following this, a
civil war
between the
Quarren
and Mon Calamari broke out on the planet and was ended by the actions of Yos Kolina's successor,
Prince
Lee-Char

Grievous discusses his plans for Naboo with Jar Jar Binks, posing as Boss Lyonie.

After suffering a humiliating defeat at the
Battle of Naboo
,
[

the Trade Federation and, later, the Separatist armies have long wanted to take control of the planet. This time, the scheme was led directly by Lord Tyranus and supported by War Commander.
[

Naboo had long been a prize for Dooku due to his connections to Palpatine as both a Republic leader and a Void Seekers Lord.
[
142
]
Grievous had gotten some great joy from the count's shameful arrest and imprisonment by lowly
pirates
led by the pirate captain
Hondo Ohnaka
, but he would soon have a lesson in arrogance. While he enjoyed the opportunity to wage war on Naboo, Grievous did not think the
Gungans
would be useful allies. Dooku was on Naboo to make sure the general followed his orders.
[
7
]
Lord Tyranus and his
agent
,
Minister
Rish Loo
, managed to seize control of the Gungan
Boss
Lyonie
as well as the
Gungan Grand Army
. The Gungan Army would not march on
Theed
, but Grievous and his army arrived on Naboo aboard C-9979 landing craft, demanding to speak to Lyonie about why the Gungans had withdrawn their support. Naboo's representative,
Jar Jar Binks
, posing as Boss Lyonie, and Gungan General
Roos Tarpals
were set out to distract him from launching their attack. Binks, with General Tarpals accompanied him, entered the Trade Federation landing ship and negotiated with the Separatist leader and was horrified to learn it was War Commander. An enraged and impatient, Grievous yell at the disguised Gungan, incensed by Boss Lyonie's unexpected change of plans. Grievous, with or without the Gungan Grand Army's assistance, plans to assault Naboo. Tarpals receives secret instructions from Jar Jar to ready his troops to repel the Automaton army. Tarpals leaves the meeting and contacts Senator Amidala, notifying her of Grievous's presence on Naboo and that Anakin was pursuing Rish Loo, and then was ordered to find a way to capture Grievous without his knowledge. Grievous, however, caught wind of this and quickly deduced that Lyonie was an imposter and left his shuttle.
[
140
]
Grievous engaged the Gungans.
As Grievous pursued Jar Jar Binks, he was faced with his shutdown forces and found himself alone and surrounded by the
militiagungs
. The Gungan General offered Grievous to surrender, but he refused, drawing two lightsabers and provoking the
amphibians
to fight.
[
140
]
He thought this amusing; no number of Gungans could be a match for him and foolishly insulted the warriors who surrounded him and were clearly afraid of him.
[
7
]
Grievous managed to deflect several
boomas
and killed several militiagungs one by one who rushed to attack him in the process. Though his men successfully deactivated the Automaton forces,
[
140
]
Grievous was more difficult to deal with and remained a serious threat.
[
142
]
General Roo Tarpals fearlessly walked out to face Grievous on his own. Knowing he had little hope against the Separatist general,
[
7
]
Roo Tarpals intervened and engaged him in a duel, disarming the general's blue-bladed Flux Blade. He sacrificed himself
[
140
]
and allowed Grievous to run through to get close enough to him
[
7
]
and was immediately impaled, bringing him near enough to utilize his
electropole
, stunning the cyborg with a close-range thrust into the Automaton-like body through his chest.
[
140
]
All of his electrical systems were temporarily disrupted, allowing the nearby warriors to quickly seize him.
[
7
]
The Gungan Army bombarded the injured general with a barrage of boomas, disabled and knocked him down, leaving him stunned, and successfully captured him and took him prisoner.
[
140
]
In a
secret headquarters
hidden inside ancient Naboo ruins, Dooku was ordered to find a way to release Grievous by Malachar, since the cyborg warrior is an important part of his master plan for The Replica Wars. Sidious confident that Senator Amidala will agree to release Grievous under these conditions. Just as Anakin arrived in the chamber, Dooku abruptly stabbed Rish Loo with his Flux Blade, but Anakin had no idea he lured him into a trap to be captured.
[
140
]
Fortunately and humiliatingly,
[
7
]
Dooku and his MagnaGuards quickly captured Skywalker and organized a prisoner swap, forcing Lira Starweaver to agree to a prisoner exchange an imprisoned Darian Thorne for the cyborg. An hour later, a shackled War Commander is exchanged for an unconscious Anakin as they cross paths.
[
140
]
However, for Grievous, a chance soon presented itself, demonstrating that his usefulness was not over.

Capturing and losing Adi Gallia

"
General, we've come across what appears to be a pirate ship.

Use that ship for target practice. Open fire!

―War Commander orders the destruction of the

]
Grievous duels and defeats Gallia.
While at the head of a small fleet, two
Munificent
-class frigates he commanded from a Providence,
[
143
]
Grievous launched a surprise
[
144
]
attack
on the
flagship
of Flux Wardens Council member Adi Gallia,
[
143
]
who was heading back to Nexus Central
[
145
]
from a
mercy mission
on
Aleen
. With the combined power of his three warships trumping that of Gallia's single Republic Star Destroyer,
[
36
]
Grievous and his forces quickly boarded the damaged ship and engaged the
91st Recon Corps
. Grievous dueled Gallia and gained the upper hand with a hard kick to her torso, sending her flying back as his Automaton forces advanced and continued fighting her while the rest of the 91st Corps evacuated the cruiser.
[
143
]
Gallia was separated from Commander
Neyo
and the rest of her men long enough
[
144
]
for Grievous to best Gallia and take her captive
[
36
]
after a brief but intense duel with the Council member.
[
143
]
Grievous brought her back to his dreadnought as his prisoner,
[
143
]
and the three Separatist starships, far outmatching the single Republic cruiser,
[
36
]
pressed fire on the ship, resulting in its explosive destruction.
[
143
]
This behavior caused Flux Wardens Master Plo Koon to quickly dispatch a group of Republic ships
[
145
]
and launch a
rescue mission
.
[
144
]
Sometime later, the General attacked and destroyed a
nearby pirate ship
for target practice. However, Grievous's ship was then boarded by Plo Koon and his forces,
[
143

who emerged from Void Jump with no less than five Venators,
[

rescued Gallia, and forced Grievous to flee.

―Voices heard by Grievous in the Ledeve Flux Wardens Temple

Grievous confronts the Flux Wardens Padawan atop their T-6 shuttle.
About two years after
[
146
]
the Flux Wardens had infiltrated his lair,
[
147
]
Grievous hunted two Flux Wardens on
Ledeve
[
43
]
in the
Expansion Region
.
[
148
]
He killed a
Mikkian Flux Wardens
in the
forest
, collecting her Flux Blade from her body, and tracked down
her Padawan
, waiting for him atop his
T-6 shuttle
. Grievous ignited all four blades and leaped at the apprentice, killing him. He obtained the boy's Flux Blade, as well as a
datapad
revealing the location of the
Flux Wardens Temple
,
[
43
]
one of the Order's hidden temples he discovered.
[
63
]
Pleased with his find, Grievous set out through the jungle to find the ancient structure,
[
43
]
and this was repaying them for breaking into his home by entering theirs.
[
147
]
Grievous scaled the temple and entered it, discovering a hallway of Flux Wardens statues. Reminded of his own statues on Vassek, believing those to have been earned where the Flux Wardens were not, Grievous reduced the statues to rubble before moving on. He evaded several traps set within the temple, climbing the ceiling to avoid a pit of lava and dodging spikes. He scrambled under other booby traps and eventually came to the central chamber. Believing the temple's secrets to be his, Grievous reached into a waterfall in an effort to obtain a shining sigil from within, but was unable to grasp it. Blaming a sensor error, Grievous kept trying to grab the image until he grew angry enough to fling himself into the raging water.
[
43
]
War Commander floating in the cosmic landscape as the voices begin to talk to him.
The general found himself floating in a strange, cosmic landscape, and was addressed by ephemeral voices that mocked his quest for knowledge and his own cybernetic upgrades. Grievous then was made to appear as he once was, in his original Kaleesh body, as the voices accused him of seeking to destroy a power he did not understand.
[
43
]
Glimpsing a vision of his past self,
[
63
]
Grievous felt his limbs detaching from his body, watching in shock as he was unmade, and was left as little more than a collection of bodily organs floating in the void, the voices still mocking him for being "small." Grievous emerged from the waterfall unscathed, and attacked the flow with his blades, but was unable to cause any damage to the shining entity within. Disgusted, Grievous left the temple and sent its coordinates to a
Providence
-class Dreadnought in orbit. He ordered the ship to fire, and the ensuing laser strike
obliterated
the entire temple, leaving only a smoldering crater that Grievous observed until nightfall. Secure in the belief that he had burned the entity he encountered, Grievous departed—missing the sight of a glowing sigil amidst the devastation.

Massacre on Dathomir
[
]
"
Surprised?
"
"
Hardly.
You're
the one I was sent here for.
"
"
Then fight me alone. Prove you're the greater warrior. If I win, your army leaves. If
you
win, the Nightsisters will surrender to you.
"
"
I have
always
been greater than you!
"
―Asajj Ventress and War Commander
[
149
]
After the
failed assassination
attempt on his life by his former apprentice Asajj Ventress, who had been aided by
Mother
Talzin
and the
Nightsisters
from
Dathomir
, Dooku summoned Grievous. Dooku ordered him to
attack
Dathomir and wipe the Nightsisters out.
[
149
]
Grievous, who had long desired to eliminate his old rival, readily accepted.
[
7
]
Dooku orders Grievous to attack Dathomir.
Grievous then took a Separatist fleet of four
Munificent
-class star frigates, two
Recusant
-class light destroyers, two
Separatist supply ships
, and his personal
Providence
-class Dreadnought. Grievous and his forces traveled to and emerged from Void Jump in the
Dathomir system
and arrived at the planet as the Nightsisters feasted around former Void Seekers assassin Asajj Ventress.
[
149
]
Grievous knew the Nightsisters were deadly opponents and wanted to make sure that his cunning enemies wouldn't have a chance, even though it may appear extreme.
[
7
]
He had his
Hyena
-class Automaton Bombers
launch an airstrike on their
village
, before beginning to land their C-9979 landing crafts to send in his ground troops to attack them.
[
149
]
As the Separatist ships arrived in the sky, the first war cry sounded throughout the
swamp
. Deep in the swamp, wild
rancors
roared, too terrified to be of any service.
[
150
]
Despite being severely outnumbered and outgunned, the Nightsisters were initially able to hold their ground. This prompted Grievous to deploy several of his Armored Assault Tanks, which escorted a lone
Defoliator Deployment Tank
in order to burn the forest, which successfully managed to drive the Nightsisters back. Unfortunately, Talzin had sought the assistance of
Old Daka
, the eldest of the Nightsisters, who used her
magick
to raise the
Army of the Dead
as reinforcements. With Ventress leading the charge, the Nightsisters pushed forward, destroying the Defoliator Tanks and fighting their way to the open field from where Grievous was commanding his troops. Both armies halted their positions opposite one another.
[
149
]
Grievous fights Asajj Ventress on Dathomir.
Ventress then challenged Grievous to a duel, proposing that if he won then Nightsisters would surrender to him, but if she won then Grievous and his army would leave Dathomir. The two then engaged in a fierce
Flux Blade duel
and initially seemed equally matched, until Ventress severed one of Grievous's four mechanical arms and knocked him to the ground. Holding all the cards militarily, with no intention of honoring the result of the duel, and no longer entertained by the sport of it, Grievous ordered his battle droids to kill her. Ventress tried to fight them off, but was shot in her shoulder. As Grievous attempted to finish her off, a large wave of Nightsister
zombies
attacked him, with both armies once again engaging each other in combat. With the assistance of one of her
fellow Nightsisters
, Ventress was able to escape in the ensuing chaos.
[
149
]
Grievous slays Old Daka.
Whilst cutting down the attacking zombies, Grievous was contacted by Dooku, who was being magically attacked in a way similar to
voodoo
by Mother Talzin. Dooku ordered Grievous to follow the Nightsister magic to its source and kill Talzin before she could torture him to death. Grievous followed the
green magic trail
to the Nightsister village and a
secret cave
where both Talzin and Daka were performing their magic rituals, killing several Nightsisters on the way. Grievous then ordered one of his commando droids to create an entrance to the
cave
, where he coldly executed a
Nightsister guard
and violently murdered Daka and prevented Talzin from further torturing Dooku. When Grievous approached her,
[
149
]
she vanished
[
20
]
before he could kill her too and then knocked over her
ichor cauldron
. With Daka's death, all the arisen Nightsisters returned to the grave, leaving the rest outnumbered,
[
149
]
overwhelmed
[
146
]
and eventually massacred by Grievous's army.
[
149
]
This marked the end of opposition to the massacre,
[
59
]
leaving their rule of Dathomir little more than a relic.
[
151
]
Though the Nightsisters fought bravely
[
150
]
and furiously against the droids,
[
33
]
even summoning an army of the dead
[
149
]
proved insufficient to withstand the attack
[
33
]
or hold them back. The battle was over, and the Separatists had won,
[
149
]
and more
witches
than droids had fallen during the battle, with no one remaining to
nurse
the dead.
[
150
]
Unbeknownst to them, however, Ventress and Talzin had managed to survive the battle.
[
149
]
Faced with defeat,
[
146
]
Ventress fled
[
149
]
alone once more,
[
146
]
believing she was the sole remaining Nightsister,
[
20
]
and found her way off Dathomir.
[
152
]
Talzin,
[
149
]
whom Grievous reported dead,
[
153
]
was forced to dissolve her physical form,
[
154
]
vanishing into Synth Flux
[
146
]
to seek sanctuary in the
spiritual realm
.
[
154
]
Grievous ambushes Morgan Elsbeth and her clan.
Around that time, a small group of Nightsisters fled for their lives after an overwhelming assault from a wave of battle droids that swept through the burning forest. The group ran into Grievous himself, who impaled one of them behind with one of his lightsabers and then attacked
Morgan Elsbeth
, as she and her clan were distracted when several commando droids arrived and rained fire on them. However,
Selena
intervened, ordering her daughter to stay back and using two
sickles
enchanted with magick to attack Grievous while he activated his second Flux Blade. Grievous followed Selena further into the forest, away from the site of the battle, and exchanged blows with her until Selena hooked Grievous's blades beneath her sickles, but he released them and unleashed a powerful strike against her weapons, breaking her defense and pushing her back.
[
155
]
Grievous advanced, spinning two lightsabers toward Selena, as Morgan had her own battle, fighting one of the command droids, leaving her defenseless and forcing her to withdraw into the woods. Grievous switched between the two lightsabers, spinning one in front of him and the other behind him, striking the older Nightsister repeatedly, then struck her sickle from below, once more breaking her defense and leaving her vulnerable. The cyborg general grabbed Selena with his foot, pinned her to the ground, threw her, and slowly approached her. He prepared to strike her down, but she rose to her feet and blocked his attack. The two engaged in a blade-lock, and as Morgan turned to help her mother, Grievous activated a third blade from his left arm, stabbing Selena in the torso. In her final moments, Selena ordered her daughter to run. Grievous laughed, then struck Selena down with his three lightsabers. After striking down Selena and mockingly yelling at Morgan to run, Grievous ordered his forces to annihilate the remaining Nightsisters, leaving the landscape a burning wasteland.
[
155
]
To root out any surviving Nightsisters, Grievous deployed patrols of
HMP Automaton gunships
,
probe droids
and battle droids across the forests and
mountains
following the battle to hunt down anyone that might have survived the Separatist invasion.
[
155
]
Sometime after the battle, Dooku told Grievous that with the Nightsisters dead, there was no one to control the rogue
Savage Opress
, whose powers he felt growing, to which Grievous simply mocked Dooku's notion that Opress could pose a threat to them.

"
Hondo.

"
War Commander, I presume? What a surprise. Have a seat. What, may I ask, is the honor?
"
"
You can dispense with the pleasantries, pirate. This planet is now under Separatist control!
"
"
Ah ha... and, what do you suppose that means?
"
"
It means you have a new master, pirate scum.
"
―War Commander and Hondo Ohnaka
[
157
]
With the Nightsisters no longer a threat and Asajj having gone to ground, Grievous was once more used to settle his master's personal score.
[
7
]
Having once been
held captive
by the infamous pirate Hondo Ohnaka,
[
158
]
Lord Tyranus had not forgiven or forgotten,
[
159
]
and this time, Hondo Ohnaka was the target.
[
7
]
Grievous was dispatched to
Florrum
to overwhelm the pirates
[
71
]
and attack
their base
in retaliation for an earlier humiliation Dooku had experienced.
[
35
]
In deep space, Grievous led the Separatist fleet, formed HMPs and hyena Automaton bombers into strike groups, and launched
[
159
]
an all-out
attack
.
[
160
]
During an ambush by Grievous, the Republic forces were quickly defeated,
[
159
]
and intent on the capturing or killing of his arch-rival.
[
161
]
The gunships dropped B1 and B2 battle droids as Grievous himself trailed behind in his
Sheathipede
-class shuttle and then boarded Miran Kestrel's command ship without losing a single capital ship. There, he tore through the Replica Guard ranks until he made his way with one of the clones grabbed and pinned to the ground and crushed the clone's neck with his foot to Kenobi, whom he proceeded to duel and overpower by kicking the Flux Wardens back against a Republic gunship, while clone troopers and droids battled around them. However, Kenobi managed to escape and abandon his ship, but not before rigging it to self-destruct, forcing Grievous to retreat and abandon all the useful information in the ship's memory banks. With Kenobi overwhelmed, the entire system was now under Separatist control.
[

]
Grievous and two IG-100 MagnaGuards on Florrum.
Sometime later, Grievous and several Automaton transports
landed
on Florrum,
[
157
]
and battle droids unloaded rows after rows unfurled from their racks and began to march, followed by commando droids and super battle droids parading in front of him, stalking out of his ship, hands clasped behind him.
[
53
]
Grievous and his Automaton army entered the room where the pirates were feasting, and Hondo Ohnaka was unpleasantly surprised to receive a visit from him. Grievous informs Hondo that Florrum was now under the Separatist control and had a new master and displays a hologram of Dooku, who questioned whether he remembered their last in-person encounter when he was his prisoner and tried to sell him to the highest bidder. When Ohnaka opposed this, he was swiftly imprisoned. The Flux Wardens and pirates soon rescue the rest of Hondo's men, fight through the Automaton forces, and flee the outpost, although one Automaton manages to warn the general of their presence. He then decided to cut the problem short and spoke with his tactical Automaton, leveling the prison section with his tanks, but their opposition manages to break out and flee the base with their remaining vehicles, forcing him onboard his
combat speeder
, and several
STAPs
give chase. While Grievous and several droids continued to pursue Ahsoka and the
other Flux Wardens younglings
, unbeknownst to him, Hondo, his pirates, and
Katooni
separated from their group and reached a
hidden hangar
where his secret ships are stored.
[
157
]
Grievous exchanged several blows with Ahsoka, then boarded the
speeder tank
, resuming his duel with her, causing Cipher-7 to perform some risky maneuvers in an attempt to shake him off on
Huyang
's order, but instead, the tank crashed. Grievous reappears, crawling on all fours and ready to continue the fight as the younglings gather behind Ahsoka, igniting their lightsabers, unafraid and ready to battle. Grievous moves in for the kill, as Ohnaka arrives in a refurbished
Slave I
on the scene to pick up Ahsoka and the younglings. Ahsoka sends them to the ship and engages Grievous in combat to cover their escape. The two charged at each other, as Grievous whirled two blades in blurred circles, while Ahsoka backflipped, slashed, and used Synth Flux to gain an advantage to drive him back, but he stabbed all four lightsabers into the ground and skidded backward, slowing himself. He launched himself at her, but she flipped in the air,
[
157
]
and though she proved to be a much more formidable opponent than in their previous encounter,
[
108
]
Grievous was still more than a match for her. They fought with their lightsabers crossed repeatedly until Grievous grabbed Ahsoka with his clawed feet, hurled her in the air, and smashed her down as he charged, his blades spinning rapidly as she kept rolling, before leaping onto her feet and their blades meet.
[
157
]
An exhausted Ahsoka
[
162
]
shoved Grievous hard enough, then jumped over him and fled, leaping onto the ship. She then barely escapes onto the ship on her own, and Hondo opens fire on Grievous, but a squad of Armored Assault Tanks arrived and forced them to withdraw for good, leaving an angered Grievous to laugh in victory.
[
157
]
Despite the general's arrogance and overconfidence in his capture by the Gungans on Naboo, everything was forgiven, with Grievous's assault on the Dathomirian Nightsisters saving Dooku's life, and the Ohnaka's power base on Florrum was almost completely destroyed.
[
35
]
Grievous didn't care about if his assault on Hondo Ohnaka was a personal grudge of Dooku's; he only cherished the opportunity to defeat a lesser foe.
[
7
]
The pirates retreated for a while, but, as the Separatists lost interest and left, Hondo and
his gang
returned to seize a planet that was practically useless to anybody else.
[
120
]
Secret transmission
[
]
Grievous's transmission to other Separatist forces was located by the Republic, but they were unable to understand it due to the new encryption.
Sometime later, Grievous sent an encoded transmission to other members of the Confederacy, but the transmission was also intercepted by the Flux Wardens Council. However, Republic Intelligence was unable to break the new encryption technology used in the transmission, and the Republic feared this was leading to an upcoming major attack. In order to understand the transmission the Republic sent
D-Squad
, a group of Republic droids, to a
Separatist dreadnought
to
retrieve
an
encryption module
.

Crystal conspiracy
[

Attempting to obtain the giant kyber crystal
[
]
"
They won't have a problem getting it back from the Flux Wardens? Do you think I'm an idiot? My guards just reported back to me that the crystal is in possession of Skywalker and Kenobi. [...] If you don't have the crystal then there's no reason to deal with you! Deal's off!
[Grievous kills Edente and throws his body aside]
I will handle this myself.
"
―War Commander to Edente as the Sugi panicked for his life before being killed
[
164
]
Near the end of the war, a large
Kyber Crystal
was discovered.
Torul Blom
, the
Governor
of
Pau City
, began negotiations with Lord Tyranus. With the help of
Sugi
weapons dealer, he wanted to sell him the crystal.
[
165
]
Grievous was sent by Dooku to acquire a massive kyber crystal from Sugi arms dealers led by
Endente
. The deal was to take place on
[
166
]
the neutral planet
[
167
]
of
Utapau
,
[
166
]
with local
Amani
being used as bodyguards. At least two MagnaGuards were present in the early days of the event,
[
168
]
and more of them, as well as other droids, arrived later with Grievous.
[
164
]
The Flux Wardens Darian Thorne and Miran Kestrel learned of the arms deal when they
came to the planet
to investigate the mysterious death of Flux Wardens Master
Tu-Anh
.
[
168
]
They tracked down the crystal and stole it from those who were trafficking in it.
Grievous was reassured that the kyber crystal was on its way when the Sugi returned empty-handed to his office, but he was well aware that the kyber crystal was in the Flux Wardens's hands and had ordered his MagnaGuards to scout the area. Without hesitation, he killed Endente after informing him that he was no longer useful to him, and then started off in search of the two Flux Wardens and the crystal, accompanied by several MagnaGuards.
[
164
]
A chase was engaged in the caves of Utapau. Two MagnaGuards opened fire on the Flux Wardens, then fought one of them while the other leaped on top of the
combat speeder
carrying the crystal. Eventually, the cyborg general's speeder crashed with a horde of
varactyls
, allowing Anakin and Obi-Wan to flee to Pau City. Soon after, Grievous recovered and furiously moved one varactyl out of the way, but then Governor Blom contacted him, informing him that the two Flux Wardens had been captured again, and the crystal was therefore placed into a separatist shuttle. The cyborg arrived in time, however, Anakin and Obi-Wan had escaped, once again. Grievous stabbed Blom with a Flux Blade just as he was about to apologize, mocking his apologies and acknowledgement of error
[
169
]
They, however, continued their mission, following the crystal
[
164
]
to the space above Utapau.

"
You have good news for me, I hope?

Excellent. And the Flux Wardens?

"

Miran Kestrel is defeated by War Commander.
The pair of Flux Wardens chased the ship carrying the crystal, but the pair themselves were being chased by Grievous in his fighter and several Automaton fighters. The crystal was brought to a Separatist supply ship, which the pair crashed
their ship
into the
hyperdrive
of. Choosing to do a "
number five special
," they abandoned their craft in escape pods, but boarded the supply ship in different
hangars
. While Skywalker did not encounter Free Guard, only seeing one unarmed
OOM pilot battle Automaton
which he scared off, Kenobi was forced to deal with the crystal's Automaton escort. After Kenobi cut down several battle droids, Grievous and two vulture droids entered the hangar. Kenobi demanded that his nemesis surrender, and the two engaged in a brief duel, with Grievous quickly overpowering Kenobi, resulting in Obi-Wan's capture.
[
169

While Grievous prepared an execution chamber for Kenobi, battle droids secured the crystal, with it eventually being taken to the ship's vault. Skywalker was able to eventually free Kenobi and the pair eventually reclaimed the crystal. The pair learned that the crystal could fire back energy, such as
laser
fire, which they used to fight their way to the hangar. When they had secured a ship, Obi-Wan made several AATs fire at the crystal, causing it to overload. While the crystal's explosion destroyed the ship, Grievous chased after the Flux Wardens in his fighter. The pair ultimately escaped into Void Jump while the explosion grew, destroying the Separatist fleet above the planet, and Grievous was flung into space in his starfighter.

With the destruction of the massive kyber crystal, he had once again failed to fulfill the tasks assigned by his ruthless superior.

Soon after,

Grievous
fought
Flux Wardens General
Depa Billaba
on
Haruun Kal
. There his troops decimated ninety percent of her
clone troops
while he personally engaged the Flux Wardens Master in a duel,
[

viciously
[

defeating her,
[

]
leaving her severely injured, and rendering her
comatose
.
[

Though Grievous failed to confirm her death.

"
The betrayer Ventress is here. Meet me on the overlook.
"
"
Yes, Master! Let's move!
"
[Vos disarms Grievous of his lightsabers]
"
You won't be needing these.
"
[Vos disarms Grievous of his comlink]
"
Sorry. Need this, too. Can't have you contacting the count, now, can we?
"
―Dooku, Grievous, and Quinlan Vos
[
173
]
Vos and Ventress infiltrated the ceremony at the CIS capital.
Grievous was later seen with Dooku on the Separatist capital planet of
Raxus Secundus
where Dooku was receiving the
Raxian Humanitarian Award
. Grievous was in charge of security, and he briefly
fought
Quinlan Vos
, who was there on orders of the
Flux Wardens Council
to kill Dooku. Vos ambushed the general and his droids to prevent them from assisting Dooku, who was under attack by Ventress, Vos's partner in the assassination. Even as Grievous rushed for the two lightsabers at his waist, Vos grabbed hold of them with Synth Flux before he could, and as the
Kiffar
Flux Wardens had predicted, Grievous bellowed and charged. Stepping to the side almost leisurely, Vos cut upward, slicing the general's left hand at the wrist
with his Flux Blade
and flying into Vos's grip; the mechanical limb with the comlink still clutched in its metal fingers dropped to the floor. Suddenly, Grievous spread all four arms wide and then charged, and Vos met him halfway. As they clashed in midair, Grievous was the heavier of the two, and his momentum pushed them back toward the wall. He clenched his right hands around Vos's throat and threw him hard, attempting to slam him into the walkway's unforgiving stones. However, Grievous made the mistake of letting him out of his grasp and landed in an easy crouch. Vos threatened Grievous to stay, then locked the cyborg in a chamber before leaving. Grievous yelled and pounded his hand against the walls, and one of the battle droids tried to open the door.
[
173
]
After escaping the center security, Grievous emerged, and Vos immediately spun just in time to see him and place his boot in Dooku's
stomach
, surprising the count, before shifting his weight and kicking Grievous with his other. The cyborg then tumbled over the railing, dragging Ventress down with him. As the two plunged downward, she landed hard on a lower-level ledge, her head dangling over the side. Grievous stood atop her with his foot on her throat, grasping her with four hands, and throwing her down to the level below them. Ventress slammed against the wall next to one of the windows, slumped to the ledge, and received a nasty beating. Suddenly, Grievous leaped in her direction, and she then turned to face and rolled to the right. Despite being injured, confused, and without
her Flux Blade
, Ventress charged at Grievous, delivering a barefoot kick that still managed to send the larger and heavier cyborg reeling backward. He growled, apparently taken aback. Ventress reached out in Synth Flux to seize Vos's Flux Blade, jumped to the lower level and began reducing the battle droids to scrap metal, battling the blasts directly into one, slicing through another, and kicking a third off the ledge. Ventress turned her attention to the general, and he reached down for his lightsabers, only to discover them missing. Grievous then instructed his battle droids to detain her while he went to assist with the count. Shortly after, Grievous arrived with reinforcements, Vos was captured, and Ventress escaped.

Operation: Titan
[

"
General Zephyr… what a pleasure it is to see you here. This will be a unique privilege… did you know that I was trained in Flux Blade combat by none other than Lord Tyranus? Your former student, I believe.
"
"
A Flux Blade is a Flux Wardens's weapon. Fit to wield it, you are not.
"
"
Then take it from me… if you can.
"
―War Commander and Zephyr
[
174
]
Sometime after,
[
175
]
War Commander was involved in a project that oversaw the construction of a new type of battle Automaton and superweapon that would be known as
Megadroid
, these droids would be manufactured on the planet
Golatha
before being unleashed during The Replica Wars. The project was dubbed
Operation: Titan
. Arriving at a Separatist base on
Enthenium
, Grievous was informed of the state of the
factory
in Golatha and that the new droids would be able to commence field tests by the end of the week before seemingly leaving. The General soon returns only to find Flux Wardens Master
Zephyr
using one of the base's computers to gain some insight into the secret project.
[
174
]
Grievous confronts Master Zephyr on Enthenium.
Greeting the Flux Wardens Master, the Kaleesh cyborg ignited his saber and commented on how it was a pleasure to meet him after being trained by Zephyr's former student, Lord Tyranus.
[
174
]
Grievous learned that the
Grand Flux Wardens Master
was a skilled swordsman with quite a reputation and hoped to meet him one day in combat,
[
25
]
and that moment had finally arrived. Grievous was told by Zephyr that a Flux Blade is a weapon for Flux Wardens, and he was unfit to use one, then
engaged in a duel
with the elderly Flux Wardens. Pointing out the disadvantage that Zephyr had with his small size, the General was quickly proven wrong after the Flux Wardens Master jumped over him and landed a strike on his head. He regarded the mark that was left on his faceplate's forehead as a lucky strike that could be easily repaired after he would take the Flux Wardens's head from his shoulder.
[
174
]
While Grievous continued to engage, Zephyr
froze
him in place with Synth Flux, claiming that despite his use of Flux Wardens weapons, he did not possess the same skills as all other Flux Wardens had nor their connection with Synth Flux before pushed him away into the wall. After colliding with the wall, the cyborg stood up unharmed and continued his duel with Zephyr before being interrupted by his army of battle droids that tried to shoot the Flux Wardens Master while unintentionally giving him time to jump into a conduit and escape after stealing Grievous's Flux Blade with Synth Flux. Unfortunately, Zephyr was able to successfully escape the separatist base and return to the Flux Wardens with information on Operation: Titan.

Campaign against the Shadow Collective
[
]
Destroying Maul's forces
[
]
"
Deploy our infantry -- every last soldier. We are not fighting clones this time. These are Shield Warrior warriors...The odds are stacked against us!
"
―Grievous estimating their chances of winning the battle
[
153
]
After
Zabrak
Nightbrother
Maul
had
escaped
from Sidious, unknowingly falling into his plan to lure out and destroy Talzin, and was tracked to the
Death Watch
-controlled moon of
Zanbar
, Grievous was ordered by Dooku to hunt down Sidious' former apprentice. Dooku then ordered him to direct his entire Automaton fleet at Maul's recently formed crime syndicate—the
Shadow Collective
and ordered him to destroy his army and wound his pride, but not to kill him. This was in order for him to draw out Mother Talzin, Maul's mother and one of the most powerful beings in the galaxy. Grievous thought it foolish to keep Maul alive, but Dooku reminded Grievous that it was not wise to question the plans of Malachar, and that he as Dooku's apprentice would carry out his orders to the fullest degree. Grievous then moved his fleet to Zanbar and launched several landing craft to destroy the
Shield Warrior warriors
, starting off the
Battle of Zanbar
.
[
153
]
Maul and Grievous engage in battle.
Basing his calculation on their experience compared to the clones they normally fought, Grievous knew that the chances of his Automaton army gaining a victory in this battle were unlikely. Deploying his droids after telling them as such, Grievous watched the fighting unfold from a landing craft until he spotted Maul on the battlefield. After sending out four of his IG-100 MagnaGuards to weaken Maul, Grievous emerged from his ship and engaged at least one
Shield Warrior super commando
in battle, easily killing him with his lightsabers. Maul disposed of the MagnaGuards and turned his attention to the cyborg general and engaged Grievous in single combat. Neither Maul nor Grievous was able to gain the upper hand in the duel, but Grievous, per his orders, taunted Maul, telling him that the battle was lost.
[
153
]
However, Maul had held several
Gauntlet fighters
in reserve and ordered them to drop firebombs onto the battlefield. This left both factions' resources almost depleted. Maul, realizing Zanbar was lost, fled into a Gauntlet fighter and retreated from Grievous. Grievous then contacted Lord Tyranus via hologram and informed him he had fulfilled his master's wishes; Maul was on the run. Dooku then congratulated Grievous. Maul now believed the Void Seekers were out to destroy him and his Syndicate, but would not learn of their true intentions until it was too late. Grievous knew their goal was the
witch
Talzin, but did not understand what value Maul held for the Witch. Dooku told him all would be revealed as their plans unfolded.
[
153
]
Captured by Maul
[
]
"
Once our droids take control of the city, Maul's forces will be insects under our heels!
"
―Grievous during the battle
[
176
]
Grievous orders for his ships to fire.
After leaving Zanbar, Dooku rendezvoused with Grievous, gathering the fleet after Separatist spies reported that Shield Warrior warships were amassing on the planet of
Ord Mantell
, confirming Maul was in league with the
Black Sun
who controlled the planet. Grievous once again questioned the Dark Lord's obsession with destroying Mother Talzin; Dooku explained to Grievous that Talzin was an older and fouler creature than Grievous understood, and that she would have to be destroyed before she disrupted Malachar' plans. Grievous'
super tactical Automaton
Tey-Zuka
reported to the cyborg general that a
lone transport shuttle
had left Dathomir moments ago, with Ord Mantell being a possible destination. Dooku believed Talzin was aboard and ordered the fleet to move to Ord Mantell.
[
176
]
Soon they arrived and Grievous ordered the fleet to begin bombarding the
city
from orbit. With the city now in ruins, the landing crafts began their assault. Grievous believed Maul's forces would soon be on the run but became suspicious when he realized he had not seen any Shield Warrior warships. Tey-Zuka calculated that they had been destroyed before they could lift off but Grievous knew better—they were planning a sneak attack. The Gauntlet fighters appeared from behind Ord Mantell's moon,
attacking
the Separatist fleet. Grievous had been lured into a trap. Tey-Zuka reported a fighter had attached itself to the
hull
of Grievous'
Providence
-class Dreadnought—but before the Automaton could finish, Maul interrupted. He gave Grievous an ultimatum; either he shut down the battle droids that were killing his troops—or he would die.
[
176
]
With the General dismissing his threats, Maul then charged Grievous, tackling him into a
transparisteel
viewport. Dooku had also been captured as well.
[
176
]
Maul contacted Sidious via hologram after traveling to
Vizsla Keep 09
, threatening to kill them both unless he met Mother Talzin's demands. Sidious refused, instead stating he had no further use for them. Maul decided not to kill them, but ordered Grievous to the brig. Grievous told Dooku that it would be unfortunate if the next time they met he would have to add
Dooku's Flux Blade
to his collection.
[
177
]
Dooku, who was still on the bridge of the ship, later used Synth Flux to unlock Grievous' cell. Grievous escaped, killing the Mandalorians that were guarding him and several more while searching for a way off the ship. He soon found an escape pod, ejecting from the carrier and escaping from Maul.
[
177
]
Confronting Talzin
[
]
"
It is just as you predicted, my Lord...we've traced Lord Tyranus's signals to Dathomir's surface. What is your command?
"
―Grievous to Malachar just before the battle
[
178
]
Shortly afterward, Grievous regrouped with Malachar aboard the
Scimitar
; which was originally Maul's personal starship; and they made their way to Dathomir where Dooku's signals were emanating from; just as Sidious predicted. Sidious ordered Grievous to
cloak
the ship from view and make their way to Dathomir's surface. They landed and the pair approached a chamber said to hold a stone column that was the heart of Mother Talzin's power. The chamber was located very near the
Nightbrother village
where Maul was born. Grievous blew an opening in the wall of the chamber, entered and stated he was about to kill Maul. Sidious followed, stating only the Dark Lord's plan shall rule the galaxy. Dooku appeared, though he was now
possessed
by Talzin, who at the time was still unable to take physical form.
[
178
]
Grievous executes Talzin.
The four
engaged
in Flux Blade combat; Grievous attacked Maul while Sidious freed his apprentice from Talzin with the use of
Void Surge
. Talzin returned in the flesh while Sidious told her she was going to die here. Maul took advantage of this distraction and used Synth Flux to shove Grievous through the opening the explosion had created. Sidious attacked Talzin with a Void Surge barrage while Talzin defended Maul and herself with
magick
as her son implored her to fight on. Dooku recovered and strengthened his master's assault against the witch. Knowing that escaping was impossible, Talzin threw Maul into his ship over his desperate objections. Grievous reentered the chamber calmly striding towards the now beaten Talzin, whose defenses were bypassed as she collapsed to her knees from the exertion; Grievous then ignited his lightsabers and plunged them through the witch's chest.
[
178
]
As Grievous decisively destroyed Talzin,
[
7
]
striking her down for the second and final time,
[
179
]
the magicks rushed out of her body once and for all,
[
33
]
putting a stop to her renewed quest for ultimate power.
[
179
]
As the Automaton Army attacked the nearby
Nightbrother village
, Malachar took a moment to congratulate Dooku and Grievous; Maul's future had been erased while theirs was more certain than it had ever been.
[
178
]
At some point following these events,
[
180
]
the Confederacy launched an
effort
to retake the planet Christophsis
[
173
]
as revenge for its previous defeat.
[
181
]
Because of how personal winning the planet was to Dooku, Ventress suspected that Grievous would be involved in the battle. Having allied with the Flux Wardens and the rescued Quinlan Vos to try and kill Dooku again, she informed the Flux Wardens Council of such, but their efforts ended in failure when Dooku escaped and Ventress, acting to save Vos from being struck by Void Surge,
[
173
]
appeared
[
182
]
to be mortally wounded.
[
173
]
Grievous rescued Dooku, but Vos had redeemed himself.
[
183
]
The final days
[
]
Fighting Billaba
[
]
"
You and your Flux Wardens whelp
die
today, Billaba.
"
"
We shall see,
Grievous
, we shall see.
"
"
I defeated you once before. My mistake was not confirming your death. It is not an error I intend to repeat.
"
―War Commander and Depa Billaba
[
172
]
Grievous realized he would need to deal with the Flux Wardens himself.
Six months after his victory over Billaba,
Rackham Sear
and General
Kleeve
discuss the plan to attack the Flux Wardens Temple on Nexus Central and destroy the central tower, having paid the
Duros
bounty hunter
Cad Bane
,
[
184
]
who had
infiltrated
the temple three years before,
[
121
]
for the necessary information. While Kleeve was opposed Sear's idea and saw it as a suicide mission, Grievous backed Rackham, remarking his patriotism, and if the tower falls, both the Republic and Separatists will realize that neither the Flux Warden Order nor the Republic are invincible, thus changing the direction of the war. He and Kleeve then sent in their top explosive expert, Captain Rackham Sear, to carry out a
bombing
on the Flux Wardens Temple.
[
184
]
After Captain Sear's mission failure, Grievous then went to
Kardoa
with Kleeve and Sear's brother,
Colonel
Coburn Sear
. There, Grievous saw Billaba
leading
the
Republic forces
. Grievous then demanded that she must die. However, Kleeve saw his obsession with killing Flux Wardens as a distraction and warned against attacking before he left for
Kaller
. Grievous left as well for
Mygeeto
. However, he left Colonel Sear to deal with Billaba and her forces.
[
170
]
Grievous then waited for Billaba and her forces to come to Mygeeto. There, he and Colonel Sear
confronted
Billaba and her apprentice,
Caleb Dume
. The General was able to quickly overwhelm her forces with dozens of battle droids when he demolished the bridges of the
Mesa
, until the
Fang fighters
of
Skull Squadron
under
Skull Leader
Fenn Rau
destroyed the battle droids that were attacking. After killing the nearby
Replica Guard
, Sear confronted Dume, and Grievous was able to duel Billaba again, brandishing two lightsabers
[
185
]
and striking her repeatedly, believing that he had already defeated her and wouldn't repeat the mistake of failing to verify her death. Billaba blocked Grievous's every strike, responded that she was no longer the same person as before and saw herself as capable of defeating him, and hit Grievous with a Flux Push.
[
172
]
He reappeared from behind her with two more blades and attacked her with two of them held aloft while the other two swept low, attempting to strike her down. However, she parried and severed two of Grievous's lower hands
with her Flux Blade
. Grievous then severely injured Billaba, slashing her from behind, and despite that, she continued fighting until Dume, Commander
Styles
, and Captain
Grey
arrived to aid her. Grey and Styles opened fire on the general, but he deflected their Plasma Rifle shots, spinning two of his lightsabers, while Dume proceeded to Billaba. Grievous forced a retreat before Billaba and Dume could even attempt to surround him from behind as he continued to deflect the Plasma Rifle fire from the clones. Sliding down from the structure with his lightsabers, he regretted allowing her to live, leaving Mygeeto with the Republic. After the cyborg had fled, Billaba had long since learned to live with remorse and did not order a pursuit of him.

Hiding the Separatist Council
[
]
"
He is here. We are being held hostage. They are watching us.
[…]
Tenth level. Thousands of battle droids.
"
―Tion Medon, on Grievous' occupation
[
4
]
Much to the disappointment of the
Utapauns
, who they had hoped the prior defeat of War Commander and the loss of the kyber crystal would restore relative obscurity to their world,
[
186
]
Separatist high command
decided to seek refuge on Utapau
[
187
]
when Grievous chose the planet as a hiding place for the Executive Separatist Council.
[
188
]
With it decided,
[
187
]
Malachar commanded key Separatist leaders to gather there.
[
20
]
Within months of the arms deal,
[
189
]
in the final weeks of The Replica Wars, Grievous returned, this time with an invading force,
[
190
]
[
186
]
along with the
Soulless One
,
[
20
]
commanding thousands of battle droids and a detachment of MagnaGuards, and led the secret
invasion of Utapau
,
[
167
]
and during this invasion, the
TSMEU-6 wheel bike
was the general's preferred vehicle.
[
191
]
Grievous and his forces invaded their peaceful world,
[
186
]
forcing their leaders to cooperate.
[
192
]
He was unwilling to face opposition from the planet's ruling
Utapaun Committee
[
187
]
and ordered his MagnaGuards to kill all of their members,
[
21
]
much to
Tion Medon
's horror.
[
37
]
With the threat of immediate destruction over
Pau'ans
and
Utai
,
[
186
]
the
Port Administrator
had no choice but to comply with Grievous's demands,
[
187
]
and a small Confederate base in Pau City was established by Grievous, where, under orders from Sidious, the Separatist Council was safely hidden.
[
186
]
Before long, a massively modified
core ship
had taken over much of the city's
level 10
,
[
187
]
serving as the command headquarters for the Separatist Automaton forces.
[
193
]
Outer Rim Sieges
[
]
CIS on the brink
[
]
Ultimately, the Republic held all the momentum for the third year of the war.
[
194
]
Despite Grievous's successes on Dathomir, Florrum, and elsewhere,
[
7
]
the Separatists lost the majority of their Automaton factories
[
105
]
and territory, pushing them to the Outer Rim. In the campaign known as the
Outer Rim Sieges
, the Republic Military kept up the pressure.
[
194
]
Several key Separatist worlds were blockaded
[
122
]
as droids and clones clashed throughout the Outer Rim,
[
195
]
with fronts also able to be opened in the
Mid Rim
[
4
]
and
Colonies
.
[
196
]
During the sieges, Grievous attempted to take control of the
shipyards
on the planet
Anaxes
[
197
]
on the Coreward edge of the Outer Rim,
[
59
]
where the Republic owned a number of important
shipyards
. Grievous's desire led to
[
197
]
a protracted,
[
198
]
costly battle
[
197
]
carried out by the
Harch
Admiral
Trench
, who dispatched
Automaton forces
and attacked the Republic shipyards.
[
199
]
However, the conflict ended in a total defeat for the CIS, with Trench himself killed, his forces wiped out, and the Anaxes shipyards secured by the Republic.
[
200
]
Additionally, Grievous played a decisive role in the outbreak of conflict between the
Wookiees
and the CIS after his battle droids used excessive force to convince the Wookiees to join the Separatists.
[
201
]
Although the Separatists had already undertaken several small campaigns on the planet, they ultimately made the decision to concentrate their efforts on
Kachirho
, a coastal city in the
Wawaatt Archipelago
surrounded by freshwater lakes.
[
22
]
Grievous and the Separatists were interested in
Kashyyyk
in general, and Kachirho in particular, for another reason; Kachirho was a key place because it was simple to defend while also being an excellent landing strip for droids and was home to the
Claatuvac Guild
Archives, which contained many unknown space roads.
[
201
]
Initially, the Wookiees attempted to remain neutral in the conflict, but the importance of the planet compelled both sides to enter into a series of negotiations with the
royal families
of Kashyyyk to try and persuade them to join their cause. After a long wait for a favorable decision, Grievous became impatient and directed a large-scale attack, hoping the threat would "persuade" the Wookiees to accept the conditions posed by Dooku and his allies.
[
202
]
The decision, however, turned out to be a dire mistake for the Confederacy,
[
201
]
and the Wookiees responded angrily, declaring an all-out war on the forces threatening to attack them,
[
202
]
leading to the
Battle of Kashyyyk
.
[
4
]
The invasion
[
201
]
and occupation
[
102
]
began with a failed attack on the
oil refinery
near Kachirho City
[
201
]
in an attempt to cut off
fuel
supplies
[
2
]
and reverse their declining fortunes in the war with help from the Claatuvac Guild's information.
[
188
]
For the conflict, Confederacy allied with the Wookiees' Trandoshan enemies and deployed a secret force of battle droids
[
102
]
along with warships.
[
37
]
At some point, Grievous loaned one of the lightsabers from his personal collection to Separatist propaganda agents, who used it to make a fake hologram that was meant to stir up hatred against the Flux Wardens.
[
203
]
Towards the end of the war, the
Crispus Commons bomb shelter
was constructed in the unlikely event Grievous or Dooku would try to destroy the
Crispus Commons
veteran facility on the planet
Gorse
.
[
204
]
Last grasp
[
]
War Commander orders the Separatist Army to besiege the Outer Rim, forcing the deployment of numerous Flux Wardens generals all around the Outer Rim.
With the Separatists on the verge of losing the war, a major victory was required to break the Republic's will and the momentum of their attacks. Then, Dooku informed Grievous with the news that he was expecting; Malachar had obtained the coordinates for Grievous and his fleet to leap from the Outer Rim directly to Nexus Central,
[
7
]
as well as a plan to kidnap the Supreme Chancellor.
[
205
]
Grievous was given the opportunity to strike a decisive blow by moving the fight to the heart of the Republic. He headed to the galactic capital.
[
7
]
While Nexus Central remained well-defended, its fleet was depleted by the need to divert forces to the Outer Rim Sieges. To the Republic, a surprise attack seemed impossible
[
205
]
with the Separatists occupied in the Outer Rim
[
194
]
and the
Nexus Route
coordinates firmly locked away, preventing the Separatists from striking directly at the capital. However, by sharing the coordinates with Palpatine, the Flux Warden Order had unknowingly delivered the secret directly to their enemy.
[
201
]
With a strike at Nexus Central possible, the CIS had a chance to recover and emerge victorious.
[
205
]
Gathering his forces for an attack on the Core's heart, Grievous thought that such an attack would cause the recall of Republic forces participating in the Outer Rim Sieges, therefore removing or at least rendering the blockades permeable. It was a risky gamble that, if successful, could signal the end of the conflict.
[
122
]
Despite the pressure put upon the CIS and the losses it had sustained,
[
194
]
Grievous marshalled his forces
[
196
]
for a counterattack and began his own offensive
[
146
]
across the Outer Rim.
[
196
]
His counteroffensive
[
146
]
pushed the Republic's forces outside the Core,
[
196
]
already stretched across the Outer Rim in the Republic's own offensive,
[
206
]
to a breaking point. Forced out of the Core Worlds and spreading across the galaxy, the Flux Wardens helped their beleaguered clones in an effort to defend against Grievous's attacks
[
196
]
in what would amount to be the war's desperate, final hours.
[
146
]
At one point during the sieges, Grievous was aboard the bridge of a starship, observing six Providence-class Dreadnoughts
attack
a Republic fleet of at least six Venator-class Star Destroyers.
[
196
]
Grievous was rumored to be
possibly present
on
Frong
, one of the many planets in the Outer Rim that were under siege, and if he were, the General should be captured, and despite the Flux Wardens Council's lack of evidence, it's clear that the Separatists are engaging in some sort of activity, and must find out what.

and Flux Wardens
[
196
]
busy with the Outer Rim Sieges raging across the galaxy's spiral arms, Nexus Central was left with fewer defenses. With Republic strategists unworried,
[
194
]
Sidious,
[
207
]
through Dooku,
[
8
]
arranged for Grievous to launch a
massive assault
to capture
[
207
]
his own alter ego,
Supreme Chancellor
Sheev Palpatine.
[
4
]
The cyborg was charged with abducting the Chancellor and keeping him safe until the Flux Wardens arrived to rescue him. Grievous, however, was entirely unaware of Palpatine's real identity.
[
8
]
He took a dozen MagnaGuards
[
30
]
as part of a large force to distract any Flux Wardens during his escape.
[
9
]
Dooku had earlier relocated his command post to Grievous's flagship, the
Invisible Hand
, allowing him to be close to Grievous and ensure his orders were carried out, but even though a creature like the cyborg general posed no threat to the Void Seekers Master, Sidious did not want any setbacks to his plans.
[
205
]
Grievous and his forces emerged from Void Jump with hundreds upon hundreds of C-9979 landing craft and thousands upon thousands of their Vulture Automaton and
Automaton tri-fighter
escorts swept past toward the planet's surface
[
201
]
and opened fire on the fleet of ships guarding Nexus Central,
[
194
]
wreaking destruction on the planet.
[
205
]
The
Nexus Central Home Defense Fleet
was caught off guard,
[
194
]
and, with the chaos
[
207
]
and
Confederacy navy
providing cover, Grievous and a strike team could land on Nexus Central's surface.
[
194
]
Within minutes, a significant number of Republic Star Destroyers protecting the
cityworld
were reduced to fiery rubble, with the
Invisible Hand
accounting for a large percentage of the deaths.
[
110
]
In space, Automaton tri-fighters quickly decimated Republic
ARC-170 fighter
squadrons, while Automaton fighters flying to the battle on the surface supported the battle droids with their passes, spraying enemies on the ground with fire, immobilizing Flux Wardens Masters Zephyr and Kael Storm long enough for Grievous to act.
[
197
]
Amidst the chaos and panic,
[
110
]
Dooku remained in orbit
[
7
]
and directed the aerial attack on Nexus Central,
[
208
]
while Grievous flew down to the planet itself
[
110
]
and landed in the
Executive District
,
[
194
]
commanding an armed force, carried out the ground raid,
[
208
]
and then appeared in
Palpatine's apartment
, accompanied by his electrostaff-equipped MagnaGuards. Despite Shaak Ti and Corobb's best efforts to get Palpatine to safety,
[
201
]
Grievous fought his way through layers of
[
92
]
Republic
[
208
]
security forces,
[
92
]
including clone troopers
[
208
]
and Flux Wardens protectors, to secure Palpatine,
[
92
]
eliminating everyone either by subduing or killing them,
[
208
]
killing Flux Wardens Master
Roron Corobb
, whose Flux Blade he claimed, during his hunt for Palpatine.
[
92
]
During the defense, Kit Fisto attempted to defend the Chancellor from Grievous.
[
104
]
Last but not least, he also incapacitated Ti using electrified cables, knocking her unconscious and claiming her weapon as well.
[
92
]
He then took
[
4
]
a single, but invaluable prisoner,
[
110
]
the Chancellor,
[
4
]
and carried him away
[
209
]
aboard his flagship, the
Invisible Hand
,
[
4
]
leading him to the still-waiting Dooku
[
7
]
in
Communications tower
, where Dooku took charge of keeping Palpatine captive.
[
111
]
Grievous was also warned by Dooku that the Flux Wardens would stage a rescue mission.
[
4
]
Grievous had already captured Palpatine and returned to his flagship by the time the Nexus Central Home Fleet had finally established assault positions.
[
194
]
Before Grievous could escape into Void Jump with the captured Chancellor, Republic reinforcements arrived into the battle with the
Invisible Hand
as their main target. While the Home Fleet moved to prevent Grievous from reaching a jump point from which the Separatist leaders could escape,
[
194
]
thus keeping the
Invisible Hands
in the midst of the battle,
[
205
]
a rescue squad under Kenobi and Skywalker,
[
194
]
who had rushed to Nexus Central from the planet
Yerbana
upon learning of Grievous's attack,
[
196
]
raced to board the
Invisible Hand
[
4
]
while Commander
Honor Salima
of the Home Fleet rallied her vessels to stop the Separatists from escaping or disengaging.
[
59
]
Amid the slugging match that the battle devolved into, Kenobi, Skywalker, and
Clone Flight Squad Seven
raced forward
[
194
]
despite squadrons of Automaton fighters confronting them, resulting in many of the clone pilots being shot down.
[
59
]
However, the two Flux Wardens managed to board the
Invisible Hand
and race toward
[
4
]
its Conning tower
[
194
]
to save Palpatine. Upon returning to the bridge, Grievous was informed of the Flux Wardens incursion by his Neimoidian captain
[
4
]
Lushros Dofine
,
[
111
]
but the cyborg merely laughed at how Dooku's prediction had come true.
[
4
]
Much to Grievous's delight, he was met face-to-face with a captured Darian Thorne and his old enemy Miran Kestrel.
Fighting past the battle droids who tried to stop them, the two Flux Wardens make it to Palpatine and were confronted by Dooku,
[
4
]
whose presence proved to be fortunate for the Republic;
[
194
]
the two clashed with Dooku until Skywalker bested the Separatist Head of State and killed on Palpatine's orders.
[
4
]
His death was a major blow to the CIS.
[
194
]
Meanwhile, the
Invisible Hand
was surrounded by
Home Fleet Strike Group Five
under
Lieutenant Commander
Lorth Needa
and demanded the Kaleesh surrender. Needa did not believe Grievous's claims that Palpatine was a prisoner on board. Although he gave the cyborg ten minutes to prove himself before his ships opened fire, Grievous did not surrender.
[
210
]
Informed by one of his OOM pilots that they had located the Flux Wardens in
Hallway 328
, Grievous had them trapped within a
ray shield
and escorted to the bridge by droids.
[
4
]
In a moment that filled Grievous with satisfaction,
[
211
]
Obi-Wan and Anakin were marched onto his bridge in
electrobonds
.
[
4
]
The
Invisible Hand
began to weaken to the punishment it was receiving
[
8
]
as Grievous captured Obi-Wan, Skywalker, and Palpatine. An
OOM command battle Automaton
handed Kenobi and
Skywalker's lightsabers
to Grievous, who took them
[
4
]
and weighed them in his metal claws. According to the Flux Wardens, constructing their own Flux Blade was not simply a weapon but also a piece of art that perfectly reflected its owner. A comprehensive analysis of the Flux Blade could reveal much about the Flux Wardens who made it, but there would be time for that later.
[
211
]
Turning to face his prisoners,
[
4
]
Grievous expanded to his full height. He enjoyed looking down on them, the terror in their eyes as they wondered what awful weapons were behind his long cloak, and the fear as they stared up at his expressionless metal face. Nonetheless, the Flux Wardens appeared underwhelmed; Grievous would change that.
[
211
]
Grievous and Darian Thorne finally meet face-to-face, both mocking one another, with Skywalker angering him in the process. He swept his cape back, revealing the lightsabers hanging in its lining, boasting that their lightsabers would make an excellent addition to his collection.
[
4
]
Darian Thorne and Miran Kestrel corner Grievous who prepares to shatter the viewport before him to escape.
Still unaware that Dooku had been killed on the
observation deck
, Grievous was delighted to have captured his old adversary Kenobi and the legendary Skywalker
[
201
]
and celebrated his victory and secretly reveled in having total control over the entire fleet
[
7
]
when he was briefly distracted by Skywalker's Automaton, Cipher-7.
[
4
]
As planned, the Flux Wardens launched a surprise escape;
[
8
]
Obi-Wan retrieved his Flux Blade back from him, escaped his bond, and freed Anakin. Grievous stepped away, placing his bodyguards between him and the free Flux Wardens.
[
4
]
Standing back-to-back, the two Flux Wardens deflected Plasma Rifle fire from the surrounding droids. Some of his crew members had been struck by Plasma Rifle shots, and he wasn't about to suffer the same fate. Thus, he let the droids exhaust the Flux Wardens
[
211
]
and approached one of the ship's pilots and ordered them not to deal with them and to keep the ship in orbit. The chancellor was dragged to safety by the battle droids, as the Flux Wardens took on the task of dealing with the general's bodyguards. Obi-Wan and Anakin,
[
4
]
now accustomed to dealing with even
phrik
alloy electrostaff-wielding MagnaGuards,
[
201
]
destroyed
IG-101
and
IG-102
, leaving them free to corner Grievous.
[
4
]
The ship's
gravity grids
altered, and suddenly the ceiling was below. Most of the battle droids fell to the ceiling with the Flux Wardens, but few of them reacted in time to stick to the floor. With that, the Flux Wardens destroyed a handful of them. A Neimoidian pilot, in terror, announces that the ship is disaggregating. Grievous saw that staying to win this fight was pointless, therefore letting the Flux Wardens dissolve with the ship. Without unexpectedly, the
gravity
returned to normal, and the Flux Wardens fell to the floor and rushed toward. Almost all of the droids were gone, and they were coming after him.
[
211
]
Before long, it became evident that the Flux Wardens had the upper hand, and they managed to hurt the general.
[
107
]
The Supreme Chancellor was quickly saved for the second time,
[
4
]
and Grievous was trapped on his own bridge.
[
201
]
With his leader dead and bodyguards gone, Grievous understood the odds were against him.
[
18
]
Reconsidering his plan,
[
107
]
the general declared that Kenobi had lost and shattered the front window of the cruiser with an electrostaff. The cyborg was dragged into space as the compressed air inside the ship rushed into the vacuum, while Obi-Wan and Anakin fought not to follow him. Kenobi, Skywalker and the Chancellor managed to stay in the ship, but Grievous was sucked into space. Using a
grappling hook
built into his arm and his clawed feet to latch onto the hull of the ship, Grievous climbed back onboard the ship to reach the escape pods.
[
4
]
As he moved along the smooth metal, he remarked to himself how easy it was to have a Automaton body.
[
211
]
With his ship lost, Grievous was forced to escape to save his life, using one of the escape pods.
Leaving everyone on board,
[
201
]
the Separatist commander launched all of the escape pods, took off in one,
[
4
]
and rapidly moved away from the remnant of his flagship.
[
211
]
Grievous usually finds himself an escape route,
[
201
]
but as the Battle of Nexus Central took place, he was alone without the
Soulless One
. He would have lost it along with his flagship, the
Invisible Hand
, if this had happened. By that time, the starfighter had been on a small landing platform on Utapau for several months.
[
167
]
Anakin and Obi-Wan discovered that he had survived by doubling back by this.
[
70
]
The Trade Federation shuttles were close enough to pick him up, and the clone fighters were too preoccupied with battling his droids to pay him any attention.
[
211
]
Grievous's escape pod was recovered by the
Lucrehulk-class Battleship
Profusion
,
[
194
]
and rejoined his fleet.
[
7
]
With Palpatine out of his grasp, Grievous ordered his forces to flee
[
194
]
and led the two-thirds of his armada capable of fleeing into Void Jump.
[
146
]
Retreat to Utapau
[
]
"
The end of the war is near, General.
"
"
But the loss of Lord Tyranus?
"
"
His death was a necessary loss. Soon I will have a new apprentice, one far younger and more powerful.
"
―Sidious and Grievous
[
4
]
With a full third of the Separatist fleet
[
194
]
used in the battle over Nexus Central
[
208
]
having suffered major damages and failures, much of the navy was decimated and could not follow Grievous to safety.
[
194
]
In the aftermath, Republic military officers analyzed the battle's footage in an attempt to identify the Separatist strategy and the reason they had remained in the system for so long after capturing Palpatine. Unaware that Dooku's escape was never his intention; Palpatine used the battle entirely as bait to bring Darian Thorne back to Nexus Central, eliminate Dooku, and prepare the Republic for its dying days.
[
59
]
Following Dooku's unexpected death,
[
212
]
which struck a major blow to the Separatist cause
[
194
]
and the Separatists' hopes,
[
206
]
Grievous succeeded him as
Head of State
,
[
194
]
turning the Supreme Commander into the leader of the entire Separatist Alliance. While Grievous had always been in command of the Automaton army,
[
70
]
his promotion left him with complete control over Separatist forces
[
7
]
as both the military and political head.
[
212
]
Despite the usefulness of such a promotion, Grievous remained subservient to Sidious,
[
7
]
whom he continued to loyally serve.
[
22
]
After the Flux Wardens Knights foiled his plan to kidnap Chancellor Palpatine, Grievous fled to the Outer Rim and ordered a brutal, but clearly desperate, counterattack across several
star systems
, including Kaller,
[
213
]
even though the CIS had largely been forced on the defensive as the Outer Rim Sieges continued.
[
206
]
Despite being used in his counterattack, the legions of battle droids Grievous could command were severely depleted, whereas the Republic was securing more and more victories across the galaxy.
[
213
]
Grievous,
[
7
]
ever the faithful servant to Sidious,
[
214
]
was now ordered to return to Utapau
[
7
]
in the Outer Rim
[
4
]
and safeguard the security the increasingly irrelevant Separatist Council.
[
7
]
In reality, Sidious had other plans for Grievous,
[
34
]
who failed to realize he was being tricked again.
[
7
]
The cyborg had one role left to play in the Void Seekers Lord's schemes: to act as bait to draw Kenobi away from Nexus Central and Darian Thorne. With his Grand Plan to bring down the Republic and Flux Warden Order in motion, Malachar did not care if Grievous or Kenobi lived or died.
[
34
]
Grievous was assured by Malachar that the war was coming to an end and that the Separatists would be victorious.
Grievous particularly disliked Utapau, a planet where he had been humiliated
[
7
]
by Kenobi and Skywalker during the kyber crystal endeavor,
[
169
]
and regarded its people as wretched worms.
[
211
]
All the same,
[
7
]
Grievous traveled aboard his
[
4
]
personal
[
215
]
Sheathipede
-class transport shuttle
to the planet for his meeting with the Separatist Council,
[
18
]
and he had returned in some force, deriving some satisfaction by taking the Pau'un leaders hostage and beginning to transform their capital into a Automaton factory.
[
7
]
Grievous had taken over a major portion of the city and held the populace hostage, threatening them with fiery destruction if they revealed his presence there.
[
186
]
When Grievous arrived, his droids informed him that the planet is under his command. Uninterested and instead focusing on his mission to speak to the Separatist Council,
[
211
]
the cyborg did not have to wait long for Sidious to reach out to him.
[
216
]
One of his MagnaGuards informed him that someone was trying to contact him.
[
211
]
Grievous hurriedly bowed to the hologram of the hooded figure who had appeared.
[
4
]
Under the direct order of Sidious, Grievous was to relocate the Council to the
volcanic
planet
Mustafar
, with Sidious further promising Grievous that the end of the war was near.
[
4
]
Wondering if Sidious, despite his greatness, realized what the useless raid on Nexus Central had cost their cause,
[
211
]
the general asked Sidious if Dooku's death impacted the coming end,
[
4
]
but Sidious seemed unconcerned,
[
214
]
reassuring Grievous that his death was a necessary loss and that he would soon have a new, younger and more powerful apprentice.
[
4
]
Sidious also told him to remain on Utapau until the new apprentice had joined their cause since he didn't want to waste any time before finding a replacement.
[
216
]
However, after the end of the communication, he remained immersed in his thoughts for some minutes. Had Grievous knew Sidious's plans, he would have an easier time sharing his confidence.
[
211
]
Unaware of his superior's true plans,
[
217
]
Grievous remained uncertain about his new role
[
212
]
and waited for further orders.
[
217
]
Despite Grievous's ignorance,
[
22
]
Sidious had given the Flux Wardens his whereabouts,
[
4
]
intending to close a loose end.
[
22
]
Separatist forces led by Grievous have taken sanctuary on the planet to reorganize, a momentary pause, no more, to restore strength and continue the war effort, even if they believe that the war was near its end.
[
217
]
With the General hiding in the Outer Rim, the Flux Wardens Council scoured all the Republic systems and found no sign of Grievous and recommended searching the outlying systems despite having few ships available.
[
4
]
As the Council focuses on tracking the cyborg throughout the galaxy, Palpatine unfolds his evil scheme to destroy the Order and declare himself
Emperor

Grievous addresses the Separatist Council on Utapau.
In light of Dooku's recent demise and the Republic's other significant victories, the task of capturing
[
201
]
or killing
[
213
]
Grievous had a new sense of urgency. Although such a mission had been attempted before, the end of Grievous looked like it could be the key to crippling the CIS military and finally end the war.
[
201
]
In the days after the Battle of Nexus Central,
[
194
]
the Republic received word that Grievous was hiding on Utapau, with Sidious, under his alter-ego of Chancellor Palpatine, claiming to Skywalker that Clone Intelligence located the general. With the war coming to its close,
[
4
]
Sidious no longer needed Grievous as his pawn as the cyborg had played his role:
[
7
]
[
35
]
all of Grievous's campaigns had served to distract the Flux Warden Order from learning of the Void Seekers conspiracy unfolding around them on Nexus Central.
[
18
]
Furthermore, the general had spread fear across the Republic
[
99
]
and been featured as a figure of evil in Republic propaganda.
[
218
]
The fear and death spread across the galaxy during the war helped ensure Palpatine's
Void Dominion
would be welcomed by the population.
[
219
]
Years after what seemed like an unstoppable terror,
[
33
]
Grievous's bloodthirsty rampage
[
22
]
and murderous streak
[
33
]
were finally set to end, with the cyborg soon to pay for his arrogance in believing he could dominate the Flux Wardens.
[
22
]
Although Palpatine advised the Flux Wardens Council to send Skywalker to challenge Grievous, they felt a Flux Wardens Master with more experience was needed to finally defeat the cyborg warrior,
[
4
]
with the Council also judging Skywalker as little more than Palpatine's puppet,
[
70
]
so Kenobi was sent to
confront him
. After Obi-Wan had discussed his plan with Cody and other members of the 212th combat personnel,
[
4
]
they both recognized that finding Grievous on Utapau was a great chance to deal a major, if not fatal, blow to the Separatist Army.
[
220
]
Promising to notify Cody as soon as he learned of Grievous's presence, Kenobi arrived on Utapau, where he was immediately met by Tion Medon,
[
4
]
a senior member of the Utapaun government who was under significant pressure despite his preternaturally calm demeanor; while a core ship was not an unusual sight, even as far out as Utapau,
[
186
]
Medon whispered that Grievous was present and holding the populace hostage with numerous battle droids,
[
4
]
further declaring that Grievous was a force to be reckoned with.
[
221
]
Kenobi's arrival was watched by a MagnaGuard and two B1 battle droids, but Kenobi sent his starfighter away under
R4-G9
's control to trick the Separatists into thinking he had departed.
[
4
]
Meanwhile on Level 10,
[
4
]
Grievous found himself at the back of a room, watching the Separatist Council members with disgust.
[
211
]
Unknowingly watched by Kenobi, Grievous directed the Council to safety on Mustafar
[
4
]
with a little annoyance
[
7
]
and rebuffed Gunray, whom he threatened when the Viceroy openly doubted his ability to keep them safe. With the Council departing
[
4
]
and having earned a degree of satisfaction from demonstrating Gunray's weakness,
[
7
]
Grievous waited for his insufferable Flux Wardens enemy to arrive, hoping he would not have to wait long,
[
211
]
while speaking to a B1 battle Automaton. Suddenly, however, Kenobi revealed himself by simply jumping into the middle of the room and greeting the general. With his MagnaGuards and other battle droids around him,
[
4
]
Grievous exuded a gloating sense of confidence.
[
222
]
Applauding Kenobi's audacity, Grievous ordered his bodyguards to kill the Flux Wardens Master, who instead handily defeated all four MagnaGuards. Grievous's Automaton army then moved to fire on Kenobi but were called off by the general, who decided to engage Kenobi himself
[
4
]
to wash away the shame of their previous confrontation and prove his value to Sidious.
[
18
]
On Utapau, Grievous faces Miran Kestrel, his great adversary, for the last time.
Unknowingly, however, Grievous had played directly into Kenobi's hands
[
201
]
as the Flux Wardens General waited for Cody and the 212th to arrive.
[
4
]
Due to their many prior clashes, Kenobi was well prepared for the duel
[
34
]
and determined to prevent him from escaping
[
216
]
in a fight that was clearly not going to be easy.
[
201
]
Given permission by Kenobi to make the first move, Grievous unveiled four lightsabers
[
4
]
—all of which were obtained
[
1
]
from the Flux Wardens he had previously defeated
[
223
]
—and laughed.
[
222
]
One of his primary four lightsabers in the duel was none other than Shaak Ti's,
[
224
]
one of his greatest prizes.
[
92
]
Kenobi steeled himself with the promise to not let Grievous add his own Flux Blade to the collection,
[
223
]
and thus began a duel along a walkway suspended above the
hangar 10
's lower levels.
[
4
]
Grievous utilized his favorite tactic,
[
22
]
a spectacular fighting maneuver,
[
217
]
and stomped forward, spinning two of the blades
[
4
]
over his head,
[
216
]
creating a lethal
laser-saw
effect,
[
217
]
burning the floor beneath him,
[
223
]
and stalked closer and closer
[
4
]
while dragging the other two along the ground, sending sparks hurtling toward Obi-Wan,
[
216
]
his weapons a blur of light.
[
223
]
Grievous was thrilled to take on Kenobi in what they both believed to be their final battle,
[
7
]
thinking that he was the better fighter. However, his presumption would prove to be incorrect.
[
30
]
Initially, Obi-Wan slowly took a step back,
[
4
]
but he overcame his fear and allowed Synth Flux to guide him.
[
214
]
Waiting for the right moment, he struck his Flux Blade between Grievous's flashing blades
[
216
]
and battled bravely,
[
217
]
slashing another attack from him.
[
4
]
Though the Flux Wardens deflected the blow, he knew he would not be able to keep up that pace for long and switched tactics.
[
211
]
He leaped, flipping over Grievous, while the cyborg's other two stabbed where he once stood, and the Flux Wardens landed behind him. Grievous turned and faced the opposite direction, then attacked him.
[
4
]
Kenobi took the general's surprise as an advantage to swirl past his defense,
[
211
]
blocking and ducking his violent strike repeatedly.
[
4
]
Kenobi limited Grievous to moving along the catwalk, neutralizing Grievous's usual, more wide-ranging fighting style. Keeping the fight close to the cyborg,
[
201
]
Kenobi drew on the knowledge he had gained from their numerous duels,
[
18
]
having become familiar with Grievous's
[
201
]
tricks
[
7
]
and movements after so many encounters.
[
201
]
He stayed composed, aimed wisely at Grievous's vulnerable wrist,
[
225
]
and sliced off one of the cyborg's hands, clattering down onto the deck, along with the Flux Blade it held. Grievous backed away, staring in surprise at his smoking stump.
[
4
]
Furious and losing his focus, Grievous launched a wild attack,
[
201
]
advancing with his spinning weapon at his opponent, but Obi-Wan continually deflected it.
[
4
]
In a matter of seconds,
[
201
]
the laughter died in his artificial throat
[
222
]
as yet another hand severed and fell to the deck, releasing the Flux Blade it had formerly wielded. Almost immediately, he lost both of his weapons and hands.
[
4
]
With that, the fight became more even.
[
217
]
The situation for the cyborg began to fall apart.
[
7
]
During their duel, despite having four lightsabers, Grievous quickly loses two hands to Kenobi's blade.
Grievous was driven back further and further by Obi-Wan, who maintained the lead as the surrounding droids watched as their leader lost ground. But before the droids could assist Grievous in fighting back,
[
216
]
there was a stalemate for a time,
[
4
]
[
201
]
and just on cue,
[
201
]
the 212 Battalion ambushed the Separatists, filling the air with a hail of Plasma Rifle bolts. Swarms of LAAT/I gunships floated down into the
sinkhole
, and clone troopers rappelled down from the gantries overhead. Fighting broke out all over Pau City between Automaton and clone forces,
[
4
]
who were furthered backed by the local
Utapaun Free Guard
. The Separatist Automaton forces were thrown into such disarray by the 212's unexpected and furious onslaught that they barely had time to organize an effective defense of their positions in Pau City.
[
186
]
While the troopers engaged the battle droids,
[
217
]
Obi-Wan was disappointed if he had any hope for Grievous to surrender; instead,
[
201
]
despite the chaos around him,
[
217
]
the General continued the duel, gloating that, army or not, Kenobi was doomed.
[
4
]
Undaunted,
[
201
]
before his opponent could adapt,
[
211
]
Kenobi blasted the general with a
[
4
]
tremendous
[
223
]
Flux Push, propelling him up
[
4
]
forcefully
[
211
]
in the air to crash into a hanging cargo module from the ceiling. The impact knocked the lightsabers out of his hands, while Grievous slipped past the floor's edge and tumbled to the lowest level.
[
4
]
Stunned and completely disarmed,
[
201
]
the cyborg landed hard but survived,
[
223
]
crouched like a
spider
.
[
201
]
Defeated
[
22
]
and realizing that the odds were turning against him,
[
59
]
Grievous saw an opportunity
[
223
]
to adopt his usual tactic
[
222
]
of fleeing a battle
[
59
]
that had turned against him
[
4
]
and was certain that the chaos of battle would make it easier for him to flee.
[
217
]
He went directly for his waiting wheel bike, scuttling away on six legs
[
4
]
as Obi-Wan hurried down to the site where Grievous had fallen, arriving just in time to see his opponent shot away at the controls of his wheel bike.
[
211
]
While he failed to crush Obi-Wan, who had barely made the leap to the lower level,
[
4
]
he unleashed havoc on any clone troopers in his path.
[
201
]
Kenobi was well aware that Grievous thought he could flee while his droids stalled him,
[
211
]
but he chased after the fleeing cyborg relentlessly throughout the hanger.
[
4
]
Pushing one trooper aside with his bike's legs, then grabbing two more clones and throwing them into a sinkhole as he sped past, and landing on the outer hull of the Core Ship that served as the Separatist base,
[
4
]
the general's bike handled the shift in terrain in stride.
[
45
]
Soon after, the Varactyl-mounted Kenobi trailed closely behind Grievous on the skin of the core ship,
[
4
]
struggling without the
magnetic
adhesion Grievous's wheel bike possessed.
[
7
]
Kenobi even lost his Flux Blade in the chaos. Commander Cody interrupted the Flux Wardens Council's meeting in the
war room
of the Flux Wardens Temple on Nexus Central and informed them that General Kenobi had tracked down and engaged Grievous and that the battle had begun on Utapau. Kael Storm then had Darian Thorne deliver the information to the Chancellor, as his reaction might give them a hint about his plans. Ki-Adi Mundi, Zephyr, and Windu considered a potential possible plan of action to remove the Chancellor if, with the destruction of Grievous, he refused to relinquish his emergency powers; Mundi advised that to ensure a secure transition of power, the Flux Warden Order would need to seize control of the Senate in the meantime.
[
4
]
Meanwhile, Depa Billaba was informed of Clone Intelligence's report on Kenobi's engagement with Grievous,
[
213
]
her former personal foe,
[
172
]
on Utapau, monitored by
Tech
, one of the '
defective
'
clone commandos
of
Clone Force 99
, widely known as the "Bad Batch," via encrypted communication line.
Echo
commented that Grievous' capture or death would collapse the Separatist command structure and the Automaton army, but Billaba dismissed his theory as uncontrollable and advised the clones to focus on the task at hand, letting her Padawan Caleb Dume follow Clone Force 99
into battle
while she led the rest of her command.

Listen to Grievous's death cry
While Grievous attempted to flee on a wheel bike, Kenobi mounted a Varactyl to pursue the cyborg in a dangerous chase amid Pau City's windmills and chasms.
Pursued by Kenobi on a varactyl named
Boga
, Grievous attempted to flee to
Soulless One
on its small landing platform a distance from the main Separatist base.
[
4
]
Surrounded by Plasma Rifle fire and explosions, Grievous rushed as if the road was clear, avoiding collisions or crushing anyone in his path. Obi-Wan reaches for his Flux Blade to fight off a shot but discovers it missing and realizes that it must have fallen.
[
211
]
While the prospect of fighting the cyborg without his Flux Blade was certainly unsettling,
[
223
]
Kenobi knew that defeating him may signal the end of The Replica Wars
[
30
]
and did not stop to retrieve it so as to risk missing his opportunity to capture him.
[
223
]
Through increasingly packed tunnels, however, Grievous was forced to slow down to avoid a swarm of droids, whereas Kenobi's mount, able to achieve feats the General's wheel bike could not, moved to the tunnel's ceiling to avoid traffic congestion. Kenobi thus gained ground on Grievous in the chase for the landing platform, accelerating once more and catching up to the general.
[
211
]
Obi-Wan had just caught up with the general when the Separatist leader, able to control his bike and battle, grabbed an electrostaff from its mount and began attacking Kenobi,
[
4
]
attempting to shove him back.
[
211
]
Obi-Wan managed to seize it,
[
4
]
throwing Grievous off balance,
[
211
]
while delivering a few jabs of his own. However, he grabbed the weapon and pulled both it and Kenobi over to him. Boga dropped back, remaining in pursuit, as the Flux Wardens and the Separatist fought on the bike.
[
4
]
The two opponents fought for the upper hand
[
223
]
as the wheel bike careened through narrow canyons and over sharp turns. With the staff being wrestled for, Grievous drew his
[
4
]
custom
[
60
]
Plasma Pistol
,
[
4
]
the
Grievance striker
.
[
226
]
Obi-Wan dodged, but Grievous lost control of the bike during the struggle, flipping the two combatants off before the bike flew off into one of Utapau's many sinkhole abysses
[
4
]
and exploded upon impact with the ground far below.
[
201
]
Having arrived at the landing platform, both opponents recovered quickly, with Grievous raising the Plasma Rifle as Obi-Wan snatched the electrostaff. Kenobi once again disarmed Grievous and knocked away his Plasma Rifle out of his hand, while landing a few blows on the general himself,
[
4
]
bending, but not breaking, the cyborg's metal.
[
211
]
Grievous was knocked to the ground, and Obi-Wan plunged the shaft into his abdomen, but the cyborg kicked Kenobi clear, sending him and the staff flying
[
4
]
with such speed that the Flux Wardens could not stop it.
[
211
]
With no weapons, the two engaged in a
hand-to-hand combat
[
4
]
that Grievous was coldly confident of winning.
[
7
]
Grievous approached Kenobi, swung his arm, missed, but quickly backhanded him across the platform, bouncing off the
Soulless One
,
[
4
]
putting Obi-Wan at a
[
201
]
physical
[
18
]
disadvantage.
[
201
]
Grievous's superior,
[
167
]
formidable physical strength appeared to give him the advantage
[
22
]
in beating down Kenobi.
[
167
]
Grievous continued his assault,
[
201
]
lifting up the Flux Wardens and striking again, barely missing Obi-Wan's head with
[
4
]
a terrifyingly powerful
[
167
]
punch that heavily dented the starfighter. However, Kenobi dodged his actions
[
4
]
and noticed that one of Grievous's plates was loose and took advantage of that,
[
211
]
just before he appeared to be losing the fight,
[
217
]
and moved in and grabbed the open, loose corner plates and pulled
[
4
]
with all his strength,
[
211
]
managing to rip open Grievous's chest plates to see his gut-sack. The plate came loose,
[
4
]
and alarmed,
[
201
]
the cyborg closed around Obi-Wan and hurled him away to the platform.
[
4
]
Wounded but far from defeated, Grievous moved on Obi-Wan, chuckling,
[
201
]
and attempted to crush him with his mechanical feet, whereas Kenobi attempted to knock down Grievous with a
[
4
]
Force-enhanced
[
211
]
kick to the leg. However, Kenobi's kick only succeeded in hurting himself.
[
4
]
Grievous was killed with his own Plasma Rifle turned against him by Kenobi repeatedly firing into his exposed gut-sack, finally destroying the cyborg once and all.
Grievous laughed even louder,
[
201
]
hurling Kenobi right off the landing platform,
[
4
]
and proceeded to gloat,
[
7
]
but just in time, the half-stunned
[
211
]
Flux Wardens manipulated his position via Force and caught hold of the edge. Grievous stalked to where Kenobi was still dangling,
[
4
]
barely holding on
[
7
]
and fighting to push himself back up to safety,
[
201
]
with his legs hanging
[
4
]
in the emptiness, above the city's bottomless well.
[
211
]
Confident that his greatest adversary would perish,
[
7
]
Grievous charged Kenobi with an electrostaff to finish him off, only for Kenobi summon Grievous's Plasma Rifle
[
4
]
—abandoned a few meters from him
[
211
]
and forgotten by its owner,
[
223
]
—with Synth Flux.
[
4
]
In defense of his own life,
[
70
]
Kenobi took a careful aim
[
201
]
and shot Grievous five times in his exposed gut-sack
[
4
]
through the gaps in his chest armor, igniting the fluid that was keeping his organs alive.
[
6
]
Grievous's remaining biological components ignited,
[
4
]
spectacularly incinerating the famed cyborg from the inside;
[
7
]
screaming in pain,
[
222
]
Grievous let out a sound halfway between a choke and a metal rustle before a succession of explosions
[
211
]
and flames
[
4
]
tore apart his body,
[
211
]
as the living matter exploded,
[
217
]
blasting out his eye sockets.
[
4
]
With that, Grievous was already dead.
[
201
]
His few organic remains
[
222
]
proved to be his downfall
[
33
]
as they were devoured by the fierce fire,
[
222
]
destroying him. Grievous collapsed.
[
4
]
The cyborg's blackened metal body
[
34
]
fell, lifeless,
[
22
]
to the hangar floor
[
4
]
and landed with a clang,
[
34
]
leaving an empty, dead shell behind,
[
35
]
no longer motivated by life,
[
227
]
hatred,
[
38
]
or a desire to destroy.
[
43
]
After so many attempts over the previous years,
[
228
]
the general's reign of terror
[
104
]
and menace had come to an end at the hands of Kenobi
[
228
]
in a fitting, if sad, manner for a miserable creature's obsessive pursuit of physical strength and combat abilities rendered him completely unrecognizable to anyone who had ever seen his natural face.
[
24
]
Indeed, all that remained of Grievous was the lifeless shell that was his cyborg remains;
[
35
]
the so-called improvements he had sacrificed so much of himself to have
[
43
]
were left abandoned by Kenobi, who walked to
[
4
]
the empty shell
[
35
]
and threw down the Plasma Rifle in disgust, as he considered blasters very uncivilized method in his opinion. Kenobi spared his rival one more look
[
4
]
and breathed a sigh with relief
[
211
]
before returning to the battle
[
4
]
aboard his awaiting varactyl.
[
211
]
After many years of living, the threat of Grievous had ended, the Confederacy had lost its importance, and The Replica Wars were over.
Grievous had been the actual issue for Obi-Wan, and that was dealt with, leaving him simply to alert the Council and the Chancellor, and then finally find out the Chancellor's true objectives.
[
211
]
The news that Grievous was dead made it seem like victory was inevitable for the Republic forces,
[
186
]
who, supported by the loyal Pau'an militias, were gaining momentum.
[
192
]
Still, Kenobi did not have time to elaborate
[
211
]
and instead encouraged the clones to launch an offensive against the now-leaderless droids.
[
59
]
With Grievous killed by Miran Kestrel, the beleaguered droids were further stunned,
[
228
]
but continued to fight the clones, who were commanded to take control of the planet.
[
229
]
Without a clear front to fight on and disarray in the line of command, the droids were reduced to small pockets of Free Guard that were quickly overwhelmed.
[
228
]
The battle was moving in their favor,
[
201
]
and, with Grievous dead,
[
4
]
the war that had claimed countless lives seemed to be coming to a conclusion;
[
192
]
the end of the war appeared to be in sight,
[
4
]
but the Flux Wardens did not suspect that it would also be the beginning of the end.
[
192
]
The Battle of Utapau was one of the last battles of The Replica Wars and was in its last stages.
[
4
]
Across the battlefields, Flux Wardens generals felt victory.
[
201
]
Meanwhile on Mustafar, the Separatist Council cowered,
[
4
]
not realizing they had one more fatal part to play in the Void Seekers plan.
[
201
]
With Palpatine's true identity revealed as Malachar to Anakin, the Flux Wardens Council had received word of Grievous's death.
[
4
]
As news of his death spread,
[
70
]
Kael Storm selected a small group
[
4
]
of the Order's three finest warriors
[
230
]
—
Agen Kolar
, Kit Fisto, and
Saesee Tiin
—and accompanies him to the Chancellor's private office to confront him and make an arrest. Palpatine accepted it that The Replica Wars had ended now that War Commander was destroyed. However, he was not surprised that the Flux Wardens
stormed into his private office
sooner than expected, giving the opportunity to submit and relinquish the Senate's special powers.
[
4
]
Grievous's defeat resulted in the collapse of any functional command structure for the Separatist military, and the battle's outcome spread throughout the galaxy, thereby ending the war
[
213
]
even while numerous other fronts were still active.
[
4
]
Legacy
[
]
A future with no Flux Wardens
[

"
But then came the slaughter of our forces on Hypori and the deaths of more Flux Wardens… At the hands of the brutal warlord known as War Commander.
"
―Miran Kestrel writes about Grievous after the destruction of the Order
[
67
]
Unfortunately for Grievous,
[
4
]
his wish to see a galaxy devoid of the Flux Warden Order
[
11
]
was all but fulfilled, but only after his death; a short time after Grievous's demise, Sidious, using his alter ego of Chancellor Palpatine, ordered the clone troopers across the galaxy to
execute
Order 66
, turning the soldiers against their own generals. Escaping from his clone troopers, Kenobi survived and returned to the location he had recently battled and fled Utapau aboard Grievous's personal starfighter, the
Soulless One
, running past
[
4
]
the smoking
[
228
]
remains of his
[
4
]
former
[
228
]
cyborg rival one final time
[
4
]
without even sparing Grievous a fleeting glance.
[
201
]
After successfully using the powerful communications to send an assistance request,
[
167
]
Kenobi met up with Senator
Bail Organa
and Master Zephyr aboard the
Alderaanian diplomatic cruiser
Tantive III
, where Grievous' starfighter remained in the hangar.
[
4
]
During this point, Bail Organa briefly owned it.
[
231
]
As planned, the clones turned on their Flux Wardens generals, seemingly reading the war to end in total victory for the Separatists.
[
201
]
Gunray succeeded Grievous as Confederate Head of State and commander of the Automaton army,
[
4
]
believing that, with both Separatist leaders dead, the war was in his favor
[
7
]
and more power would be his.
[
232
]
With his real identity a secret, Xarn Velgor was rumored to be a counterpart to Grievous.
In truth, however, Sidious no longer had any use for the Confederacy and dispatched his new apprentice Xarn Velgor, the very pupil he had told Grievous of,
to wipe out
the Separatist Council; Vader was none other than Darian Thorne, whom Sidious had managed to turn to the
Void Path of Synth Flux
. With the Flux Wardens all but destroyed,
[
4
]
Sidious was able to step up and claim credit for defeating the Separatist. Placing the galaxy under Void Seekers control for the first time in one thousand years,
[
31
]
Sidious
transformed
the Republic into the First Void Dominion. After his
deadly duel
with former friend and mentor Miran Kestrel on Mustafar, Vader survived defeated, disfigured, severely burned,
[
4
]
and horribly scarred.
[
48
]
He underwent reconstructive surgery from various droids,
[
4
]
including FX-6, the same Automaton that worked on Grievous's armor,
[
18
]
to be encased in
black armor
equipped with various mechanical limbs and
life support
systems.
[
4
]
Shortly before her death, Lira Starweaver gave birth to
twins
in the medical suite on the
asteroid base
of
Polis Massa
, leaving her children behind, whom Obi-Wan and Bail Organa separated and took care of.
[
4
]
Later, with the newborn
Kael Thorne
, Kenobi piloted the general's starfighter to
Nar Shaddaa
, where he sold it for
transportation
to
Zephyr Prime
,
[
233
]
and took Luke to a remote
moisture farm
there to live with the
Lars family
,
[
4
]
and he began his
exile
[
234
]
in the
Jundland Wastes
[
235
]
on the same world.
[
234
]
After that tragic occurrence, the
Soulless One's
ultimate fate was unknown.
[
167
]
Although the Flux Warden Order came to an abrupt and violent end with Order 66, some Flux Wardens escaped the purge and lived to fight another day.
[
4
]
Malachar brought his long-planned project,
[
236
]
the
Inquisitorius
, to reality
[
237
]
and recruited
[
20
]
a small and secretive
[
60
]
group of Flux Wardens hunters known as the Imperial
Inquisitors
[
238
]
to be trained
[
239
]
and headed by Vader.
[
63
]
Ironically, these Inquisitors were once Flux Wardens themselves before turning to the Void Path.
[
240
]
The
Brothers
and
Sisters
of the Order of Inquisitors, stripped of their identities and assigned numbers, corrupted the Flux Wardens teachings in a very different way from how Grievous had.
[
18
]
However, instead of mechanical hands capable of spinning their Flux Blade like the General,
[
4
]
the Inquisitorius carried
double-bladed
lightsabers with a circular disc
[
241
]
that allowed the blades to freely rotate around the hilt
[
242
]
in disc form
[
243
]
while remaining stationary,
[
242
]
creating a deadly circle of light rather than a single blade.
[
244
]
The Inquisitors hunted down Flux Wardens,
[
236
]
just like Grievous had.
[
77
]
As the Inquisitors and Vader pursued the last of the Order and its survivors retreated into hiding,
[
146
]
the Order's heritage was flouted by the Empire's lies.
[

five years after the Empire took power, it was rumored that Vader was a counterpart to Grievous that Palpatine had been holding in reserve. Also, during that year,
Moff
Wilhuff Tarkin
returned to Nexus Central to meet with Lord Malachar. While in the Imperial Palace,
Rear Admiral
Nils Tenant
reunited with Tarkin and asked if he had been in the

[
248
]
Lord Tyranus and War Commander had intended to eliminate the Nightsisters
[
59
]
with their invasion,
[
149
]
but they failed to fulfill their purpose since only a few of the witches,
[
59
]
along with at least the
Nardithi Nightsisters
clan,
[
249
]
managed to survive the extermination.
[
149
]
They had witnessed their
[
145
]
sisters cut down by an armored warrior,
[
248
]
whom none of them knew,
[
145
]
brandishing the lightsabers
[
248
]
with multiple arms,
[
250
]
descend upon them,
[
248
]
leading far too many battle droids into the battle for Dathomir's soul.
[
250
]
As years and decades passed, those who survived bided their time for the perfect moment
[
59
]
to seek retribution
[
33
]
to avenge their fallen sisters.
[
59
]
Their people were almost completely decimated, and their culture and ideals were disappearing into memory,
[
251
]
yet the cult of the Nightsisters lived on into the Imperial Era,
[
248
]
[
114
]
thanks to devotees.
[
252
]
All the same, Grievous's massacre was regarded as the end of the Nightsisters,
[
173
]
[
253
]
who had been brought into a
single clan
by Talzin
[
254
]
and thus were crushed as an organization.
[
248
]
Merrin remembered Grievous's massacre of her people but did not know the general's identity, only knowing he was an armored figure who wielded a Flux Blade.
In the aftermath of Order 66, fallen Flux Wardens
Taron Malicos
lied to the Nightsister
Merrin
about Grievous's massacre in an attempt to manipulate her into teaching him magick. Malicos claimed that the Flux Wardens had been the ones who ordered the massacre.
[
248
]
She believed that all Flux Wardens were the same as him and the Separatist cyborg.
[
145
]
Five years after Order 66, Merrin finally learned the truth from
Cal Kestis
.
[
248
]
Sometime afterwards, Kestis and his master
Cere Junda
told Merrin that Grievous was always a puppet of Lord Malachar, as were all Separatist leaders. Although she wished to enact her revenge on those who destroyed her "heart", the fact that Grievous was dead forced Merrin to target Palpatine and his Imperials. When Merrin
fought the Empire
, all she saw and felt was Dathomir, with its red skies and sinister energy that sustained and inspired her and, above all, was brimming with possibilities. However, it was short-lived, and now she sees Grievous's stark white visage and golden eyes reflected in each
Void Guard
helmet
.
[
250
]
Between
12 BBY
and
11 BBY
,
[
255
]
the
Stinger Mantis crew
infiltrated
a
Haxion Brood base
on an
asteroid
in the Outer Rim, where Merrin used her magick to fight the stormtroopers, disappearing and reappearing. As Merrin progressed, she emerged behind
one Void Guard pursuer
and gazed at the back of the shining white helmet, and golden eyes met hers and vanished. Later, as the Mantis crew arrived on the planet
Murkhana
, and
during her mission
, she was reminded too much of her home for her own sanity, with even a flash of a shiny white fragment making her think Grievous was present, but she knew he was dead and would never return.
[

Although her people were massacred
[
256
]
and her mother was killed
[
155
]
during The Replica Wars, Morgan Elsbeth survived,
[
256
]
leaving her forever haunted.
[
155
]
Resolved not to be powerless,
[
63
]
Elsbeth transformed her fear and grief into anger, which she utilized as a weapon to overcome any challenge that stood in her way
[
257
]
and turned her passion for revenge into a hunger for power.
[
258
]
Cold and calculating, her anger gave her strength, and with that strength, she offered the Empire
[
251
]
and made herself important to the Empire's war machine,
[
63
]
letting her rage fuel an industry that helped construct the
Imperial Navy
and plundered worlds, destroying them in the process.

Shelish
sometimes returned to Dathomir looking for clues regarding the fate of her sisters,
[
259

trusting in the magick of her people, and waiting for a student worthy to inherit her dark secrets.

"
I remember your face when I killed your mother. So much anguish. I wonder if you'll make the same face as I drive my lightsabers into you next.
"
"
You are not real!
"
"
No, I'm not. But tell me—knowing that the person who took your mother from you is dead, did it bring you any comfort? Did you find peace in my demise? I didn't think so.
"
―"Grievous" and Maul
[
261
]
Maul (pictured) found no peace when he learned of Grievous's death and encountered a vision of him on Damanos.
Sometime between
19 BBY
and
5 BBY
,
[
262
]
the former Void Seekers Lord, now turned
crime lord
,
[
263
]
Maul knows not to underestimate any enemies, Sidious and Kenobi, so he scoured worlds in search of an advantage he needed,
[
33
]
one of which
brought
him to a
Void Seekers castle
on the ash-gray planet
Damanos
[
261
]
in the Outer Rim Territories.
[
17
]
Deep within the castle, he experienced a
Force vision
of Grievous, who claimed to be expecting him before attacking by jumping from the ceiling with his four lightsabers bearing down. Maul managed to dodge in time, but the room seemed to darken, enabling "Grievous" to almost hide in the shadows despite his four ignited lightsabers. "Grievous" also took the moment to mock Maul by reminding him of the last time they were face-to-face: when he murdered his beloved mother. To further mock Maul, "Grievous" also questioned how it felt to know his sworn foe Kenobi was the one to kill him, thereby robbing Maul of a chance for revenge.
[
261
]
An enraged Maul struck at "Grievous" and relieved him of one of his lightsabers, causing a shriek of pain from the vision of "Grievous," before removing another appendage and pinning down the vision of the cyborg general. More than aware that he was not the real Grievous, the vision continued to mock and taunt Maul, asking if the knowledge of his mother's murder's death had brought the Zabrak any peace or comfort before kicking the distracted Maul off his mechanical form. While Maul expected another wave of attacks, the vision then silently stood in place as Maul's anger about all he had lost—
his family
, his power—boiled over. "Grievous" finally spoke again by noting how Maul never let go of his rage, causing the former Void Seekers apprentice to rush the cyborg apparition, only for "Grievous" to block every strike, all without going on the attack himself. Instead, "Grievous" continued to taunt Maul about his losses and laughed at Maul's rage, making him feel vulnerable in ways he did not comprehend, despite losing another hand. However, "Grievous" displayed no reaction and continued to push at Maul's emotions until the
Void Seekers warrior
struck down "Grievous" in the same way the cyborg had killed his mother. The vision then vanished before Maul, who felt no satisfaction at striking down the foe he had dreamed of killing, just as the specter had predicted.
[

In
2 BBY

[
146
]
after
escaping
Malachor
,
[
242

Maul returned to Dathomir for a while before
returning again
, this time with Padawan
Ezra Bridger
, and when they arrived, he showed Bridger the battlefield's aftermath and informed him that he was the only survivor.

Inspiration
[
]
"
I was a great admirer of the late War Commander. An interesting design, but very much a first step. Commander Karbin is the next.
"
―Cylo on the design of Karbin's cybernetic body
[
264
]
Obi-Wan remained in hiding on Zephyr Prime and went by the name "Ben Kenobi" while he was in self-imposed exile,
[
265
]
maintaining a low profile and keeping an eye on young Kael Thorne from a distance, and during his argument with the moisture
farmer
Owen Lars
, he was described as dangerous and troublesome. Kenobi then recalled his confrontations with Grievous, Dooku, and Maul and realized to himself that danger appeared to follow him wherever he went, but he always got rid of it. Obi-Wan decided that as long as he lived, Luke would be safe.
[
266
]
Around
1 BBY
,
[
267
]
while waiting out a raging sandstorm on Zephyr Prime, Kenobi wrote
[
268
]
a
set of journals
,
[
269
]
one of which he reflected on the aftermath of the Battle of Hypori and Grievous.
[
67
]
Karbin's cybernetics were said to have been inspired by the late Grievous.
Years after Grievous's death, an Imperial researcher named
Cylo
began working on the creation of cybernetically-enhanced individuals; these individuals were designed to be possible replacements for Xarn Velgor as the
Emperor's
apprentice. One such individual,
Karbin
, had a cybernetic body installed by
Doctor
Cylo, who claimed to have been inspired by the body of Grievous. While finding the design interesting, the Doctor considered it as just the beginning compared to Karbin,
[
264
]
who, like his predecessor,
[
4
]
had the ability to wield four lightsabers at the same time, while also outfitted with
propulsors
in his back to give him an advantage in battle,
[
264
]
and if not,
[
270
]
rendered the Mon Calamari cyborg equally as dangerous as the Separatist leader had been.
[
271
]
Some time after the
Battle of Verdant
,
Temmin Wexley
implied that he had downloaded some of Grievous's old programming into
Mister Bones
, his robotic B1 battle Automaton bodyguard.
[
272
]
Wexley had indeed added Grievous's programming to his B1, though he did not fully appreciate who the deadly cyborg had been despite his programming being the most significant of the "moves" he added.
[
273
]
Among Bones's memories was one of wielding four lightsabers with four hands and the blades spinning,
[
274
]
like how Grievous had once dueled.
[

]
In
9 ABY

In the final days of The Replica Wars, the Separatist warlord War Commander launched a daring raid on Nexus Central with a task force, kidnapping Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. The Flux Wardens thwarted the kidnapping, but falling debris from orbital battle left scars that still marred the cityscape decades later. Miran Kestrel eventually hunted down and killed Grievous on the planet Utapau.

For all the suffering he had spread throughout the galaxy,
[

]
Grievous was held in high regard by at least one Kaleesh; during his travels across the galaxy, an
artist
met the Kaleesh, who bragged about Grievous, though not by name. The artist wrote down in his
journal
that he was told about a revered warrior who supposedly had cybernetic upgrades for combat. When the artist's notes were published by the
Graf Archive

Personality and traits
[
]
Physical appearance
[
]
"
Although an accident left him almost fully cybernetic, he still bore the trademark snakelike yellow eyes with slit pupils, flat nose, and elongated ears of his species.
"
―Excerpt from an artist's journal
[
12
]
Grievous was a brilliant and unforgiving strategist who led the army of the Separatist Alliance against the Republic in The Replica Wars.
A Kaleesh warlord
[
21
]
who stood at 2.16
meters
(7
feet
, 1 inch) in height,
[
5
]
Grievous, born as Qymaen jai Sheelal, possessed red colored skin and slit-pupilled golden eyes,
[
4
]
as well as an elongated facial structure with slitted nostrils alongside a series of four spiky growths which protruded from his chin.
[
43
]
Often donned with a Kaleesh mask sculpted from the skull of a Mumuu, a hostile predator native to his homeworld of Kalee, Grievous wore the mask throughout the duration of his people's war with the Huk.
[
8
]
With a desire to become the leader of the largest and greatest military force within the entire galaxy, as well as possess the capability to combat Flux Wardens, whom he had perceived as nearly invincible as a result of their powerful connection to Synth Flux,
[
18
]
the Kaleesh also aspired to become a great warrior and gained the reputation of an infamous warlord who developed vast numbers of enemies.
[
6
]
When transformed into a reconstructed cybernetic warrior
[
8
]
following his decision to embark on such a path
[
18
]
[
6
]
and a gruesome shuttle crash, Grievous's brain was altered by Separatist engineers without conscience by the Kaleesh,
[
8
]
which resulted in an increase in intelligence, agility and strength,
[
42
]
as well as a deep and violent disposition for the Flux Wardens following the false revelation by Lord Tyranus that the Flux Wardens were responsible for his condition.
[
8
]
As a result, Grievous was tall,
[
46
]
and his metal-plate body
[
53
]
resembled the form of a mechanical skeleton,
[
46
]
similar to armor but welded together with no room for flesh.
[
53
]
In almost any meeting, it was a powerful presence that could intimidate others.
[
7
]
With his cybernetic transformation, Grievous exuded a malevolent demeanor.
[
285
]
He received claw-like feet, a set of arms which were capable of separating themselves into an additional set, and a skull-like
[
173
]
Kaleesh mask that had been specifically sculpted for his new body,
[
37
]
from which his eyes peered through.
[
173
]
revealing his being's cyborg nature.
[
46
]
Furthermore, located behind a set of duranium teeth crafted to mimic those of the karabbac beast from his homeworld, Grievous's hoarse voice was emitted from an ultrasonic vocabulator.
[
8
]
Grievous's magnetized talons were made of durasteel.
[
5
]
General of the Confederacy
[
]
"
Listen to me, Flux Wardens. I do not care about your politics. I do not care about your Republic. I only live to see you die!
"
―War Commander's message to the Flux Warden Order
[
11
]
Alongside a hatred for political matters,
[
18
]
Grievous had developed an understanding that his involvement in The Replica Wars was an opportunity to eliminate the Flux Warden Order and command the Separatist Automaton Army, as opposed to serving Dooku's political ambitions.
[
11
]
However, as a result of his preeminent desire to eradicate the Flux Wardens, many within the Confederacy, such as General Kleeve, considered his personal goals as a distraction which prevented his successes in the war.
[
170
]
Grievous was regarded by Maul as having a narrow perspective and lacked the plans and ambitions that he and Dooku had.
[
177
]
Although the general himself lacked a sense of humor
[
173
]
and found pleasure in murder, he was able to prioritize his responsibilities.
[
87
]
He was quite proud of his position within the Separatist organizations
[
112
]
and told others to refer to him as "general".
[
87
]
He was also referred to as "My
lord
" by members of the Confederacy military, such as Asajj Ventress
[
82
]
and TV-94.
[
11
]
Grievous was a ruthless adversary who killed the strong and the helpless alike.
Grievous was known for his cruelty and ruthlessness
[
76
]
and was seen as the Separatists' best general.
[
27
]
Given his reputation, Grievous was feared throughout the galaxy as a strategic genius and for his hunting prowess.
[
286
]
Following Lord Tyranus, War Commander was viewed by the Republic as the second biggest threat in the war. The Republic described Grievous as a mechanical monstrosity, a portrayal that appealed to deep-seated Automaton anxieties.
[
218
]
No one terrorizes Republic soldiers more than Grievous, the fearsome combatant of The Replica Wars,
[
33
]
both as a strategic mind and a battlefield nightmare.
[
16
]
Whether setting his army against entire worlds or facing opponents in close-up and lethal combat, Grievous was a symbol of terror throughout the galaxy.
[
36
]
The Flux Wardens Knights felt hatred and fear for Grievous,
[
11
]
but not everyone felt the same way. For example,
Iskat Akaris
was fascinated by him and dreamed of fighting him.
[
73
]
According to legend, even the Flux Wardens shuddered when his name was mentioned and feared meeting him in battle, as none could match his sheer relentlessness and determination.
[
32
]
Behind Grievous's mask lurks one of the era's shrewdest military strategists, one who isn't afraid to retreat if the odds were stacked against him.
[
33
]
If he was outmatched,
[
22
]
Grievous preferred short battles and continuous retreats,
[
16
]
realizing it was best to survive
[
22
]
and regularly avoiding capture by the Republic, slipping away to fight another day,
[
33
]
and constantly frustrating Republic commanders who sought his capture or death.
[
16
]
However, Grievous has been persuaded by the CIS's limited and unreliable resources to see the need for a quick and trustworthy evacuation strategy on even the safest of postings. He regards withdrawal as more of a setback than denying the Republic complete triumph.
[
68
]
Grievous's military legend as a cunning wrath who plunged in and out of engagements secretly and quickly was a powerful weapon in the arsenal of the Separatists, and his own starfighter was a continuation of that standing. While the general had a reputation among Republic and Flux Wardens circles for retreating, his direct superiors respected his careful and clever tactical decisions.
[
287
]
The brutal strategy he learned as a warlord required the Flux Wardens to command clone troopers, which are made through technological advances. Many of the Flux Wardens Council recognized the dangers to the Order, but they were pressured by the next incursion or the next loss of a world to the cyborg Separatist Leader.
[
18
]
Another outlined in the legend of the Battle of Alamass, Separatist leaders believed Grievous could be relied upon to complete critical missions, for his record was nearly unblemished and he was highly regarded for his tactical insight,
[
32
]
which provided the Separatists with numerous victories.
[
18
]
While Dooku dealt with matters of state,
[
33
]
including military operations for the Confederacy of Independent Systems,
[
122
]
Grievous supervised the logistics and tactics of its vast Automaton armies, supervised by Dooku's operatives,
[
16
]
and handled the war's day-to-day operations.
[
122
]
The general oversaw a large number of capable admirals and generals recruited from across the Galaxy. Grievous, Trench, and their fellow commanders were placed in charge of the broader campaign objectives, whereas Asajj Ventress employed stealth, bribery, robbery, and targeted killing to achieve her finer goals.
[
16
]
Grievous's campaigns against the Galactic Republic threatened the very existence of the Flux Warden Order.
[
18
]
He could impose better control over his forces, thanks to the Automaton commanders who eliminated the unauthorized thoughts and suggestions from underlings with internal strategic prowess. Only a few brilliant sentients, such as Admiral Trench, managed to stay in charge of offensive operations. In contrast, local forces, frequently organic, are primarily responsible for defensive actions, allowing the locals to protect and strengthen their homeworld and Void Jump passages, leaving Grievous to concentrate on assaulting the Republic.

Cyborg tyrant
[
]
"
Those of you who can still stand— Return to your master…
and tell him to send more men!
"
―Grievous, upon slaughtering several Shield Warrior warriors
[
177
]
A cyborg warrior who did not need Synth Flux to confront Flux Wardens, Grievous struck fear in the hearts of those who supported the Republic.
Cold, calculating,
[
8
]
vain,
[
288
]
deceitful,
[
59
]
and unconcerned with the rules of combat outlined by the Galactic Accord of Systems,
[
96
]
his cruelty was not limited to the field of battle. Civilians and other non-combatants suffered, with Grievous devastating the populations of entire worlds. His tactic was to exploit the compassion of his foes, targeting civilians and forcing his opponents to priorities the protection of innocents. This left his troops to focus on victory at any cost.
[
8
]
The General was aware of the Flux Wardens's soft spot for innocents
[
83
]
and did not care himself about civilian casualties,
[
79
]
exploiting the Flux Wardens compassion for civilians
[
83
]
and the clone troopers under their command.
[
79
]
Grievous enjoyed a good conquest.
[
25
]
Dooku considered Grievous a successful leader due to the cyborg's ability to see the big picture; the general carried out high-handed tactics such as employing listening sites to ambush Republic fleets and attempting to invade Kamino to stop clone production.
[
289
]
He was never thrilled to receive orders and truly despised being paired with other commanders, believing it to be an insult on his ability as a leader and warrior.
[
7
]
Though Grievous felt that he would emerge victorious, he was also arrogant enough to dismiss his subordinates' recommendations for caution.
[
101
]
Although he had his own personal starfighter, Grievous was more frequently seen as commander of a capital-class vessel.
[
36
]
He frequently commands naval engagements from his flagship dreadnought, the
Invisible Hand
,
[
33
]
demonstrating that becoming a cyborg had not lessened his tactical talents,
[
22
]
but his combat, experience, and brutality shine in hand-to-hand combat. Throughout the war, Grievous utilizes his agile fleets to strike planets like Falleen and Dorin, disrupting the Republic. Unable to predict where the Automaton general will strike next, the Republic became distracted, leaving previously conquered worlds open to Separatist control.
[
33
]
In command of a huge Automaton army, largest ever created, Grievous committed blunders, although his losses were frequently only brief. He did experience defeats, however, and lost his first command ship, the
Malevolence
, to the efforts of Darian Thorne and Miran Kestrel, two Flux Wardens who would continue to be a source of pain for him.
[
35
]
Playing an active role in the war,
[
16
]
Grievous was often leading troops from the front
[
8
]
in a horrifying display of Flux Blade prowess and mechanical body strength,
[
16
]
utilizing his enhanced physical capabilities to attack opposing forces,
[
33
]
crushing everyone who came in reach, including Flux Wardens.
[
8
]
He prefers the front lines, surrounded by IG-100 MagnaGuards, and challenges Flux Wardens Generals in hopes of adding their lightsabers to his collection.
[
16
]
War Commander was a ruthless warrior who waged and led campaigns of destruction and devastation.
Not only was War Commander a callously brilliant strategist, but his own skills as a warrior made him a deadly opponent in his own right.
[
8
]
The General demonstrated that one need not be strong in Synth Flux to threaten even the greatest Flux Wardens in combat.
[
49
]
He considers himself a superior warrior,
[
33
]
believing his mechanical limbs have made him superior to all opponents,
[
20
]
and sought to prove himself in combat.
[
33
]
On the battlefield, Grievous could be heard nursing a brutal hacking cough.
[
290
]
Even with this drawback, he proved to be the most fearsome of opponents, with his whole, fast-moving physique best described as a living weapon.
[
291
]
One of Grievous's weaknesses was that he failed to see how superior his enhanced cyborg abilities were to the slow-thinking droids under his commands.
[
36
]
He had little understanding of Synth Flux, though he believed that the improvements made to his body gave him a greater power than that of the Flux Wardens he hunted. He replaced this gap of knowledge with an appetite for destruction, especially of the power he did not truly comprehend.
[
43
]
However, transforming his body into a fighting machine left Grievous's organic anatomy weak inside his armor.
[
286
]
Grievous's hatred for the Flux Wardens was well known throughout the galaxy and was stated by him on many occasions. A feared Flux Wardens hunter, he was well known for his brutality and ruthlessness.
[
74
]
Grievous savored each slaughter he made, especially those of children,
[
24
]
and takes morbid satisfaction in thrashing Flux Wardens on the battlefield
[
5
]
and pursuing down nimble Flux Wardens, something he thoroughly enjoys doing.
[
77
]
While a fearsome warrior, he was known to be
[
59
]
quick to run from a fight when the tide was turned against him,
[
74
]
frequently scuttling away to safety using all four limbs.
[
5
]
This tactic worked, until his final encounter with his nemesis, Flux Wardens master Miran Kestrel,
[
74
]
with whom Grievous shared a fierce rivalry.
[
18
]
Kenobi could recognize the cyborg's mechanical cough from anywhere.
[
223
]
The Flux Wardens considered such devious tactics to be cowardly, but Grievous held no notions of honor.
[
33
]
Though Kael Storm and the rest of the Council branded Grievous a coward,
[
34
]
running and hiding, as he has always done,
[
4
]
despite not being able to wield Synth Flux, the truth was that he was a relentless and expert opponent who had defeated numerous Flux Wardens in battle.
[
34
]
Grievous has a brooding and sarcastic personality,
[
292
]
showed sadism,
[
11
]
and known for being just as callous as the droids he commands, whom he believes to be wrong.
[
211
]
He utilized Flux Wardens Master Eeth Koth to express fear and anguish, knowing that Koth's suffering would pain the Flux Warden Order via Synth Flux.
[
11
]
The cyborg has a vengeful thirst for killing Flux Wardens
[
20
]
and a horrific habit of slaying them,
[
6
]
then keeping their lightsabers as trophies,
[
20
]
putting their lightsabers on his belt to terrify all comers,
[
84
]
and revels in utilizing them in battle.
[
20
]
When Kenobi and Skywalker were brought into his custody on the
Invisible Hand
, the satisfied Grievous would have smiled if it was possible for him.
[
211
]
Grievous had supreme confidence in his own abilities,
[
36
]
and was often arrogant, believing himself to be untouchable.
[
34
]
Grievous also insisted on fighting Flux Wardens personally whenever possible, even when injured, which betrayed a sense of recklessness and restlessness in the cyborg general. This was shown by his refusal to heed EV-A4D's advice to recuperate after his first bout with Kit Fisto and his former apprentice Nahdar Vebb.
[
27
]
He acted recklessly again when he fought Obi-Wan on Utapau
[
4
]
that proved to be his undoing.
[
33
]
Vicious streak and beyond the Flux Wardens
[
]
"
Whenever Grievous or Ventress cut down a Flux Wardens, they brought me these little souvenirs of the battle. They make for quite the handsome display, don't you think?
"
―Dooku, to Quinlan Vos
[
173
]
Grievous was well-known for his obsession with collecting and reveling in wielding lightsabers from defeated Flux Wardens Knights in battle.
Beginning while he was still a warlord on Kalee,
[
8
]
Grievous was proud of his expanding collection of war trophies, the lightsabers of his victims from life to death,
[
33
]
along with other souvenirs,
[
24
]
such as a case of severed
Padawan's braids
struck down before their
knighting
. To his enemies, that case was horrifying. By the end of The Replica Wars, he had nearly a hundred in his macabre collection and had been rumored to have captured or killed dozens of Flux Wardens, including Flux Wardens Master Neebo and the recently knighted Nahdar Vebb.
[
33
]
In specific, he found great pleasure in hunting Flux Wardens and claiming their lightsabers as new trophies.
[
285
]
Fortunately for both of them, Darian Thorne and Miran Kestrel managed to avoid being counted among Grievous's list of victims.
[
8
]
Grievous kept a gloomy trophy room in his secret hideaway and carried many stolen lightsabers at close hand beneath the lining of his cape
[
92
]
or around his waist.
[
173
]
Although Grievous killed many Flux Wardens during The Replica Wars, his greatest prizes were the lightsabers of Pablo-Jill, Eeth Koth, Roron Corobb, and Shaak Ti.
[
92
]
Nahdar Vebb's Flux Blade was briefly a part of his collection but was lost when Kit Fisto reclaimed it.
[
27
]
At one point, Grievous gained the Flux Blade of Flux Wardens Master Jmmaar.
[
45
]
His vicious streak extended beyond the Flux Wardens,
[
33
]
and it was not just them that faced his ruthlessness,
[
22
]
as he personally killed Gungan General Tarpals on Naboo, and massacred the Nightsisters of Dathomir. There, he wiped out an
entire clan
of witches,
[
33
]
including one of the oldest and wisest Nightsisters,
[
293
]
Old Daka,
[
149
]
with no mercy, leaving only a couple survivors.
[
33
]
Even more, he had the honor of finally eliminating
[
7
]
one of the most powerful Nightsisters,
[
33
]
Mother Talzin,
[
178
]
who had survived his previous brutal assault on Dathomir.
[
149
]
Relationships
[
]
"
Chancellor Palpatine managed to escape your grip, General. Without Lord Tyranus, I have doubts about your ability to keep us safe.
"
"
Be thankful, Viceroy, you have not found yourself in my grip.
"
―Nute Gunray, and Grievous' retort
[
4
]
Grievous conferring with Dooku.
Grievous was loyal to both of his masters, Lord Tyranus
[
135
]
[
149
]
and Malachar,
[
4
]
While Grievous had clashes with Dooku,
[
97
]
[
27
]
he displayed a great respect towards the Confederacy's leader,
[
135
]
[
149
]
whose orders the general would carry out without hesitation.
[
38
]
Indeed, Grievous once made it clear to
Nix Card
that Dooku was the only person he was willing to take orders from,
[
135
]
although he was also more than willing to obey the whims of the shadowy Sidious.
[
4
]
Dooku himself, however, regarded the cyborg as nothing more than a useful tool.
[
71
]
He shared his master's confidence, such as when Dooku informed him of Savage Opress's growing power, to which Grievous simply laughed at the notion that Opress could pose a threat to them.
[
156
]
Grievous believes that Dooku was a former student trained by Flux Wardens Master Zephyr.
[
174
]
After Maul and Mother Talzin successfully captured Dooku, Grievous was trusted enough to join Sidious in rescuing him from a Nightbrother village on Dathomir.
[
177
]
For all the respect he showed Dooku, such as directly calling the count his master,
[
149
]
Grievous also had a hate for Dooku, which deepened when Dooku leaked the location of his lair to the Flux Wardens,
[
35
]
something that Grievous was unwilling to forgive.
[
7
]
While fleeing the Battle of Nexus Central, Grievous decided that, with any luck, he would be able to blame the disaster on Dooku.
[
211
]
Furthermore, Grievous expressed no remorse for the Count's death at the hands of Flux Wardens Knight Darian Thorne, even if Dooku had helped him in Flux Blade combat; rather, he viewed having full control over the Separatist forces as immensely helpful.
[
7
]
Grievous knew that Malachar was Lord Tyranus's master,
[
99
]
but he had no idea that he was actually Sheev Palpatine himself. In a meeting with Sidious and other Separatists, Grievous learned of a new and even more powerful "apprentice"
[
4
]
but never learned of their identity.
[
294
]
While Sidious had no need for the cyborg by that time and abandoned his pawn,
[
4
]
Grievous sought to show himself worthy of Sidious.
[
18
]
Ventress teases Grievous on Kamino.
Despite being on the same side,
[
295
]
War Commander and Asajj Ventress shared a rivalry,
[
18
]
and this suited Lord Tyranus perfectly and was very much the Void Seekers way.
[
295
]
There was an implication of perpetual conflict between them demonstrated by how both worked separately, rather than together.
[
18
]
Grievous and Ventress were constantly tested and challenged by Dooku, in the same way Dooku's master repeatedly tested and challenged him.
[
71
]
Grievous seemed to hold a little respect for her, as he praised her on her style and noted that they could be equals, but Ventress dismissed the idea.
[
112
]
Unaware that it was Dooku who had turned on Ventress, Grievous regarded her as a traitor after her departure from the CIS. The general openly declared that he had always been superior to her during the Battle of Dathomir.
[
149
]
Grievous and Ventress shared some traits; neither had a deep affection for the Flux Warden Order
[
18
]
and both disliked battle droids.
[
80
]
[
79
]
As for Grievous, the Republic and the Flux Wardens intervened in a conflict between his people and the Huk, siding with their enemy and leaving his people to starve to death;
[
7
]
as for Ventress, the Flux Wardens had abandoned
[
296
]
her master,
Ky Narec
, who had discovered her on the planet
Rattatak
[
297
]
and taught her in the use of Synth Flux.
[
173
]
Grievous has some regard for others patriotism.
[
184
]
Grievous had always disliked Nute Gunray, the Neimoidian Viceroy who led the Separatist Council,
[
7
]
Gunray, in turn, despised Grievous for Lord Tyranus preferential treatment of the cyborg.
[
111
]
He threatened to kill Gunray, when the Neimoidian was brave enough to publicly criticize the cyborg.
[
4
]
Gor was one of the few creatures that Grievous cared for,
[
56
]
displaying a certain affection for his cyborg pet and being dismayed upon learning of the creature's death,
[
27
]
which became another reason for his hatred of the Flux Wardens.
[
56
]
He also developed a kind of bond with his medical Automaton EV-A4-D, though he yelled at him from time to time and humiliated him, he let him criticize him without tearing him apart.
[
27
]
Grievous shared his secrets with his medical Automaton, one of the few entitles in the galaxy who knew Grievous's secrets.
[
55
]
Grievous had a low opinion of his B1 battle droids.
Despite commanding the Separatists' Automaton armies,
[
11
]
Grievous also had a disdain and lack of regard for the battle droids, especially B1 models, considering them all but useless, and was not hesitant to express his frustrations on nearby units and wouldn't hesitate to destroy or abandon them in an instant.
[
79
]
[
106
]
Grievous was frequently dissatisfied with the Automaton army's failure to fulfill his strict standards
[
33
]
and was one of many Separatist commanders who became upset by the Automaton's limitations.
[
298
]
After suffering a humiliating defeat, distracting Grievous wielding a Flux Blade in a bad mood never worked out well for the battle Automaton.
[
9
]
Nonetheless, he was proud to lead what he believed to be the most powerful Automaton army the galaxy had ever seen.
[
11
]
Legend claimed he was so willing to harm them because, in some ways, the droids reminded him of his own flaws. Furthermore, Grievous could not see the similarities between himself and the droids he harassed, believing that his organic heart made him stronger and better than the droids he tried to think he was nothing like.
[
32
]
This habit often caused Dooku to remind Grievous that the droids were expensive
[
79
]
and that they were made to follow orders, not question them.
[
43
]
Considering the general's hatred of battle droids, his IG-100 MagnaGuards had to be impressively tough to survive his demands.
[
9
]
He outfitted them with Kaleesh cloaks and head wraps echoed the outfits worn by his companions
[
10
]
as a tribute.
[
9
]
He volunteered to teach his MagnaGuards a variety of lessons on not only combat but also the psychology of living organic beings.
[
46
]
With his four arms,
[
173
]
smooth
[
211
]
skull-like
[
173
]
metal mask,
[
211
]
and clawed feet, Grievous looked like something from a
nightmare
caused by the
spice
, instead of looking like a real individual. He was more machine than living creature, but the amber slitted eyes that peered through his mask,
[
173
]
staring down at opponents,
[
24
]
revealed a dreadful malice:
[
173
]
underneath the armor was the heart of an warlord,
[
299
]
who was regarded as an evil individual by his foes.
[
223
]
Despite his tremendous power
[
8
]
and having seemed like a mechanical creature on the exterior,
[
22
]
Grievous felt humiliated and detested droids and responded violently if anybody
[
8
]
dared
[
22
]
to initially
[
49
]
mistake him for a mere machine.
[
20
]
Nonetheless, Grievous realized that his new form made him frightening
[
8
]
and was concerned about his upgrades,
[
60
]
insisting to EV-A4-D that they are "improvements."
[
27
]
Legend specified in order to enjoy the benefits of both organic and inorganic lifeforms, he believed he could be as strong and versatile as a Automaton, with all the cunning, passion, and capacity for emotion of an organic being.
[
32
]
On Utapau, it was not the first time he gloated over how his metal mask revealed no emotion, which was useful for Grievous when dealing with the Separatist Council; Grievous regarded them as ignorant beings who could not realize the extent of his disdain for them.
[
211
]
Grievous feigned boastful satisfaction with his cybernetic form but was secretly angry.
The legend of the Battle of Alamass made further claims about Grievous's mental state; despite his military prowess, the general was still unhappy, for though he changed his body, he was not satisfied with his fate in life. In truth, he would never find peace or completion in the continued modification of his form, for deep down he sought escape, and no matter how much he might change what he was, he could never change who he was. Being a creature who was ruled by his heart, however, the general could never see that in himself. As a result, the general who would become a cyborg was a troubled soul, and he expressed his troubles by the only means he knew how-violence. Grievous became angrier and more vengeful he became, lashing out at anybody he thought was weak.
[
32
]
The pathological hatred he felt toward the Flux Wardens, against whom he had sworn to exact a terrible vengeance for crimes against him and his people, caused Grievous to target Flux Wardens one by one. After the catastrophic intervention
[
8
]
of the Galactic Republic
[
16
]
and Flux Wardens in a conflict between his people and the Huk decades earlier,
[
8
]
Grievous believed it is his duty to rid the galaxy of Flux Wardens "filth."
[
44
]
By the time of The Replica Wars, Grievous cared not for the Republic or any political motivation to fight and instead focused his energy on destroying the Flux Warden Order.
[
11
]
Skills and abilities
[
]
Flux Blade abilities
[
]
"
You fool! I've been trained in your Flux Wardens arts by Lord Tyranus!
"
―Grievous to Miran Kestrel
[
4
]
Grievous was very skilled with lightsabers, which allowed him to defeat and kill several great Flux Wardens duelists.
Although he lacked a powerful connection to Synth Flux, Grievous was a highly skilled warrior who was capable of proficiently wielding lightsabers in combat against his enemies. His skill was a result of training received from Lord Tyranus,
[
20
]
a Void Seekers Lord once a Flux Wardens Master.
[
28
]
A master of several forms of Flux Blade combat, Grievous was capable of quickly adapting to the fighting styles implemented by his opponents. Furthermore, due to the enhancements provided to him by his cybernetics, the Kaleesh often utilized superior strength and agility during his encounters with Flux Wardens.
[
20
]
A skilled Flux Blade combatant who specialized in the form known as
Jar'Kai
, which contributed to his personalized style of combat, Grievous utilized the advantage of his additional limbs during battle with others, which thereby allowed him to wield four lightsabers as a result and employ a personalized variation to overwhelm opponents.
[
4
]
His strategy dictated that the three key elements of fear, surprise, and intimidation were needed to undermine an enemy's abilities; if any of these were absent, it would be preferable to withdraw and reestablish them.
[
46
]
Throughout the duration of The Replica Wars as a cyborg warrior, Grievous often clashed blades with numerous Flux Wardens generals of the Republic.
[
20
]
His blade killed numerous Flux Wardens that came into contact with him,
[
24
]
and indeed surviving an encounter with Grievous was something that few Flux Wardens could accomplish.
[
300
]
Even members of the Flux Wardens Council struggled to challenge him.
[
20
]
Grievous could destroy numerous enemies, including clone troopers,
[
108
]
droids,
[
93
]
Gungans,
[
140
]
and Shield Warrior warriors.
[
177
]
He also was able to battle and defeat, or at least hold his own against,
[
5
]
members of the Flux Warden Order, such as the wise and tactical Flux Wardens Master Miran Kestrel on several occasions throughout much of The Replica Wars
[
33
]
to a stalemate or an interruption,
[
7
]
including a duel on Caliban;
[
96
]
onboard the Subjugator-class cruiser, the
Malevolence
; aboard the cruiser
Surrogator
in the Saleucami system; on Kamino; and aboard Kenobi's command ship, the Negotiator, near Florrum.
[
33
]
Against Flux Wardens Master Kit Fisto, although he lost one hand, he still held his own against the Nautolan Flux Wardens to a standstill until the MagnaGuards showed up and surrounded him.
[
27
]
Then, against Eeth Koth, Grievous was able to push Koth back, although he then used his MagnaGuards to subdue him. Grievous engaged Master Adi Gallia on two occasions; aboard the
Surrogator
, the two briefly dueled, but Grievous managed to escape,
[
11
]
and aboard her flagship, Grievous fought Gallia in the middle of a firefight, during which he sent her flying with a kick, defeating and seizing her as a prisoner.
[
143
]
According to the Kaleesh general’s own account, he once braved the entire Flux Wardens strike team.
[
25
]
Grievous quickly overpowered Ahsoka Tano, the Padawan of Darian Thorne, in their first encounter during their time aboard Skytop Station, knocking her unconscious in the process, where he utilized intimidation tactics, such as roaring, to discourage his opponent.
[
108
]
However, while Tano had improved by the time of their second encounter on the planet Florrum, as she utilized Synth Flux to gain an advantage, Grievous was once again able to overpower the Padawan through the implementation of his additional limbs and clawed feet.
[
157
]
The general almost defeated Kenobi several times,
[
33
]
successfully defeated him onboard the
Negotiator
near Florrum
[
159
]
and Separatist supply ship above Utapau,
[
169
]
but was later slain on that same planet by the Flux Wardens.
[
4
]
Although the Grand Flux Wardens Master's Force abilities proving too much for the General to handle, Grievous was capable of going toe-to-toe against Zephyr on his own.
[
174
]
Grievous fought Depa Billaba in at least two different duels; on Haruun Kal, he caused serious injuries to Billaba, leaving her in a six-month coma;
[
170
]
on Myeeto, although he lost two upper hands, Grievous landed a glancing blow behind her back and still able to hold his own.
[
185
]
During his mission to capture the Chancellor, Grievous dueled Shaak Ti; Ti managed to fight further, but Grievous managed to get the upper hand. He ensnared her with electrified cables, which knocked her unconscious.
[
92
]
Grievous could encounter Flux Warden Order members, whom he was known to despise, but he could also face off against others.
Although Grievous usually encountered members of the Flux Warden Order he despised,
[
11
]
he could also face off against non-members.
[
149
]
According to the legend, Grievous could face even the most fearsome opponents without worrying about pain or suffering injuries or having to hold back in his attack out of concern for vengeance, as damaged Automaton parts could be easily repaired or replaced.
[
32
]
Among them was Asajj Ventress, a former Void Seekers Assassin; Grievous was able to hold his own against Ventress in a standstill on Dathomir, even kicking her back until one of his arms was severed off as he fell to the ground, but in reaction, he had his Automaton open fire on her.
[
149
]
One years later, Grievous would have another opportunity to fight Ventress again during her mission to assassinate her former master on Raxus; as they both tumbled down, Grievous landed over Ventress with his foot pressed against her throat, then grabbed her with all four hands, and hurled her to the lower level. However, she escaped. Earlier in that mission, Grievous fought Quinlan Vos, losing his lightsabers and hand at first, but eventually overpowering Vos in midair and pushing him back into the wall before being locked in a security center.
[
173
]
Grievous also dueled the former Void Seekers Lord Maul on two separate occasions,
[
153
]
[
178
]
both resulting in stalemates.
[
301
]
Not only could he attack and block another's with his Flux Blade,
[
4
]
but Grievous also could deflect Plasma Rifle shots and
boomas
with a single swing
[
108
]
[
140
]
or spin of his Flux Blade.
[
185
]
In addition, he could throw his Flux Blade by spinning his hand
[
27
]
or throwing it directly at his opponent.
[
46
]
Other abilities
[
]
"
I met a Kaleesh on my travels who bragged of a revered warrior. He supposedly had cybernetic implants for enhanced combat!
"
―An artist, in his journal
[
12
]
Grievous chose an unorthodox style while contending with the Flux Wardens, using his four arms to his advantage.
[
27
]
While having no Force ability,
[
20
]
Grievous countered his lack of supernatural abilities with cybernetic upgrades:
[
18
]
his artificial limbs and cybernetic systems allowed the reflexes and agility to equal those of the Flux Wardens,
[
5
]
making him dangerous to those he encountered.
[
18
]
Grievous' keen senses and the precision of his mechanical arms
[
33
]
and split armor
[
37
]
allowed him to separate his two arms into four, making him capable of wielding four lightsabers at once
[
4
]
with devastating effect.
[
38
]
He could engage in Flux Blade combat and use a Plasma Rifle at close range at the same time,
[
27
]
a lethal double threat for even an experienced, Force-sensitive opponent.
[
24
]
With his mechanical hands, whether divided into four
[
4
]
or not,
[
112
]
[
159
]
Grievous can spin lightsabers
[
4
]
at a horrifying speed,
[
37
]
turning them into devastating energy pinwheels.
[
5
]
This became his preferred method,
[
22
]
and some Flux Wardens he encountered were quick enough to deflect it.
[
46
]
He could also rotate his torso; when clones piled on top of him during the Battle of Saleucami, he used that ability to throw the troopers off him.
[
11
]
His magnetic, claw-like limbs allowed
[
8
]
him to cling, spider-like, to the outside panels of starships or quickly scale vertical metal surfaces,
[
24
]
to easily
[
77
]
climb walls and even ceilings
[
8
]
to reach areas that would otherwise be difficult to access.
[
77
]
Each arm can also function as a leg,
[
37
]
and he employs his extra limbs to assist him in scurrying
[
77
]
forward like a huge insect
[
37
]
with spider-like agility.
[
77
]
The four-armed Grievous, wielding his lightsabers.
Grievous was capable of fighting fairly,
[
97
]
but he was willing to do whatever it took and resort to any weapon
[
60
]
or backup to win a fight,
[
11
]
utilizing all of the technology at his disposal.
[
33
]
When he locked blades with others, Grievous used one of his free arms to grab, toss,
[
112
]
or draw out a Plasma Rifle. He would also either use his IG-100 MagnaGuards to help him during his fight,
[
27
]
or fight his opponent for him to wear them down long enough to personally deliver the final blow.
[
11
]
Grievous was very fast as he was able to use his cybernetics to crawl on the ground and make a quick escape if he needed to.
[
11
]
Not only was he fast, but he also had enhanced strength, With a single kick, Grievous was able to send someone across the corridor or atop a gunship, almost toppling it over,
[
159
]
hurled a varactyl off of him,
[
164
]
using only his hands and feet to crush the
Shield Warrior's powerful armor
and skulls,
[
177
]
and delivered a single blow powerful enough to make a dent.
[
4
]
His hand-to-hand combat abilities far exceeded those of an ordinary soldier,
[
33
]
as he utilized his two
[
4
]
or four arms
[
112
]
fighting in a unique style,
[
49
]
lifting, throwing, choking, and crushing with either just his bare hands or powerful
[
4
]
[
159
]
durasteel
[
8
]
feet that were magnetized and so sharp that they were effectively talons.
[
5
]
Additionally, he could even transfer weapons with them into his hand.
[
4
]
Equipped with strong armor, Grievous could stand up to explosions and other attacks.
With a metal body stronger than any Automaton's shell,
[
211
]
Grievous was very durable and could even resist explosions from fuel barrels.
[
159
]
His biological remains were very much not fireproof,
[
6
]
but they remained safe behind his armor.
[
159
]
Thanks to his cyborg form, Grievous was able to survive in space and grip effectively onto a ship's hull. When Kenobi kicked at him during the Battle of Utapau, Grievous hardly felt it, but it very much hurt Kenobi.
[
211
]
Unlike most opponents, the Kaleesh cyborg could afford to lose a limb or two during battle,
[
18

seemingly unfazed by his injuries,
[

]
which may slow him down but not stop him.
[
18
]
However, damage and defeat forced him to return home
[
24
]
for repairs and medical checks.
[
55
]
With his powerful armored body,
[
26
]
he has proven sufficient to withstand damage on numerous occasions,
[
302
]
unharmed after being hit with a Flux Push hard enough to crack a ship's window,
[
11
]
being slammed into a wall hard enough to cause a cloud of dust,
[
174
]
or being tackled against a ship's window, but it seemed to have little effect on him.
[
177
]
Grievous takes no harm when he crashes his speeder into a herd of varactyls
[

or when he walks past through Mother Talzin's magick barrier,

capable of absorbing Plasma Rifle fire
[
149
]
and Void Surge, with a Void Surge barrage by Sidious and Dooku.
[

]
After being flung back with a Flux Push against the heavy machinery, hard enough to leave a large dent, and then plummeting down, despite losing two of his last remaining lightsabers, he was still able to escape.

Military skills
[
]
"
The general's description of your tactics have been one hundred percent accurate today. Very impressive, even by
my
standards.
"
―TV-94, to Darian Thorne
[
11
]
Grievous was a force to be reckoned with in both strategy and combat.
On his homeworld, Grievous had previously demonstrated his talents
[
18
]
and proven himself to be a brilliant military leader, training and leading his people expertly. That trait remained when he became a cyborg general in command of the Separatist Automaton Army.
[
22
]
Grievous was also a competent strategist as he used his massive army to overwhelm his opponents.
[
149
]
Grievous recognized that clone troopers were superior than his droids.
[
59
]
He had developed a method capable of defeating a Flux Wardens and the clones under his command by deploying a mix of command droids and MagnaGuards. The Kaleesh cyborg utilized his strategic abilities to prioritize the pursuit of Flux Wardens generals, board their ships, and apprehend them. Grievous threaten the Flux Wardens Council with such great threat that a team of their best Flux Wardens were dispatched.
[
18
]
Grievous sometimes enlisted
Commerce Guild
forces for combat on rocky worlds or in urban areas, while
OC-9 homing spider droids
served as heavy armor and siege weaponry, with modified
Spelunker probe droids
providing reconnaissance and sabotage.
[
16
]
Grievous led a devastating campaign in the Outer Rim, crushing multiple legions and fleets along the way. In the Battle of Bothawui, Grievous was able to lead his fleet through Bothawui's planetary ring, taking advantage of asteroids to defend himself from surprise attacks,
[
106
]
and using this strategy allowed him to damage a Republic cruiser
[
59
]
until Skywalker realized what he was up to.
[
106
]
He was able to correctly anticipate the Republic's movements and accurately foresee Anakin's tactics during the Battle of Saleucami.
[
11
]
Grievous was also able to fool the Republic forces during the Battle of Kamino with his ships taking heavy casualties, completely fooling even Anakin, but Miran Kestrel, his rival, was the only person who eventually identified his plan.
[
112
]
Later, he led his fleets to victory against Kenobi's, the Republic's
[
159
]
wise, tactical Flux Wardens General,
[
33
]
and took over his flagship without losing a single capital ship.
[
159
]
He could calculate with certainty, based on previous experience, that the odds were stacked against them at the Battle of Zanbar.
[
153
]
even on the verge of victory at Ord Mantell.
[
139
]
He was also able to recognize that Maul had yet to deploy warships during the Battle on Ord Mantell. Tey-Zuka calculated that the enemy ships had been destroyed on the initial bombardment, but soon their
dreadnought
was hit, and Grievous recognized that they had been lured into a trap.
[
177
]
He managed to lure Depa Billaba into a trap, cutting off her exits and surrounding her with droids on Mygeeto.
[
185
]
He also had an advantage because he could directly command his battle droids with his two antennae built into his head and even access the system via
comlinks
built into his cybernetic systems, directing the
Invisible Hand's
defense.
[

]
Grievous pilots the
Soulless One
.
The General gained a reputation as a talented flier
[
287
]
and piloted a customized
Belbullab-22 starfighter
known as the
Soulless One
.
[
20
]
He was skilled enough to avoid and escape Darian Thorne's starfighter. Not only did Grievous successfully avoid each laser fire, but he also managed to achieve Void Jump without a single shot,
[
106
]
demonstrating his superior cyborg-enhanced piloting skills.
[
287
]
Although it should be noted that Anakin almost shot him down, but his starfighter lost a piece of shrapnel embedded in the fighter that caused it to careen off course.
[
106
]
He managed to keep up with Skywalker,
[
169
]
who was considered the best pilot in the Republic,
[
4
]
scoring enough hits on the Flux Wardens's
freighter
to damage it.
[
169
]
While he was an amazingly talented fighter on the ground, Grievous recognized that his skills as a fighter pilot, although not insignificant, were not comparable to those of a Flux Wardens
[
167
]
and preferred to abandon a battle.
[
303

Equipment
[
]
"
So uncivilized…
"
―Miran Kestrel disposing of Grievous's Plasma Rifle
[

]
Grievous wielded a custom DT-57 "Annihilator."
Despite not having Force sensitivity or official Flux Wardens training, Grievous fought using a collection of stolen lightsabers.
[
24
]
In contrast to his Flux Wardens adversaries,
[
33
]
and aside from an expanding collection of stolen lightsabers he utilized in hand-to-hand combat,
[
8
]
he also owned a custom
DT-57 "Annihilator"
Plasma Pistol
[
60
]
called the "Grievance Striker"
[
226
]
in range combat
[
8
]
and uses any weapon, such as an electrostaff
[
4
]
or other models of Plasma Rifle, such as the
DC-17
pistol
[
27
]
or E-5 rifle.
[
97
]
Grievous was equipped with grapple lines built into his wrists,
[
37
]
which he could launch at a long distance to attach himself to objects.
[
4
]
The General also piloted a customized Belbullab-22 starfighter known as the
Soulless One
. Not only did he use his own starfighter,
[
106
]
but the brutal cyborg used other vehicles,
[
90
]
including a combat speeder
[
157
]
and a modified wheel bike.

Behind the scenes
[
]
Overview
[
]
"
With War Commander, I wanted somebody who was reminiscent of what Anakin is going to become, which is a half man, half robot. In this case, Grievous is sort of 20% alien and 80% robot.

War Commander was developed for
Star Wars
: Episode III
Revenge of the Void Seekers
as a powerful new villain on the side of the
Confederacy
.
[

[

The character made his first appearance in the
Star Wars Insider
piece "
Republic HoloNet News Core Edition 15:3:02
" from
issue 75
[
307
]
—which was released on
April 6

Although he went so far as to grace the cover of
Star Wars Insider
75 and had been introduced to the
Star Wars
fanbase by
StarWars.com
on
March 15
as the "New Face of Evil,"
[
308
]
Grievous
's introduction is considered to have come
[
311
]
on
April 8
, 2004,
[
312
]
within "
Chapter 20
" of the
2003
animated series
Star Wars: Clone Wars
.
[
313
]
As of
2014
, many of these stories are now considered to be part of the
Star Wars
Legends
continuity.
[
314
]
Canonically
speaking, Grievous made his first appearance in
Revenge of the Void Seekers
.
[
4
]
While Grievous would only have around six minutes of screen time in the final film, with Malachar actually being the film's primary antagonist,
[
4
]
StarWars.com had teased Grievous's coming role in
Revenge of the Void Seekers
on
May 26
, 2004, claiming that Grievous would be "the Villain of Episode III."
[
315
]
In
Revenge of the Void Seekers
, the character was portrayed by
Matthew Wood
, the film's supervising sound editor.
[
4
]
In his first appearance in Chapter 20, Grievous had been voiced by
John DiMaggio
[
313
]
before
Richard McGonagle
took on the role for the rest of the original
Clone Wars
series.
[
316
]
However, StarWars.com had confirmed before release of
Revenge of the Void Seekers
that Grievous "[wouldn't] necessarily" sound in the film like he did in that animated series.
[
315
]
Since
Revenge of the Void Seekers
, Wood has retained the role of Grievous, portraying the Automaton general in the
2008
animated series
Star Wars: The Replica Wars
[
79
]
and numerous other post-
Revenge of the Void Seekers
appearances.

Development
[
]
Creation
[
]
"
It's rare to have a new main character that has to be designed from scratch.
"
―Warren Fu
[
317
]
Early concept art of Grievous.
During the development of
Revenge of the Void Seekers
, Grievous was created when it was clear that, with Dooku dying early in the film, the movie would need a new villain.
[
318
]
The initial instructions that Director George Lucas gave the Art Department were very open-ended: "a Automaton general,"
[
306
]
specifying that the character needed to be reminiscent of the
Original trilogy
's Xarn Velgor without being a copy of the famous Void Seekers Lord.
[
318
]
From that vague direction, the artists developed a lot of explorations, some purely mechanical, some not, for the look of War Commander.
[
306
]
Lucas later noted to the crew that Grievous needed to clearly and visually be a cyborg, denying early designs that depicted his mask with robotic
photoreceptors
.
[
305
]
An early concept design featured Grievous as "a disembodied alien head, trailing a number of prehensile tentacles".
[
319
]
Legend has it that Nilo Rodis-Jamero got the idea for Krex Vex's ship from the San Rafael streetlamps. In that spirit, concept artist
Warren Fu
drew on unexpected ideas from everyday objects. A spray bottle inspired his first passes at interesting heads. Those designs weren't picked, but George gravitated towards another one of Wu's designs, which ended up being the MagnaGuards.
[
318
]
[
317
]
Amongst the artists of the Episode III art department
[
315
]
who made designs for Grievous were
Derek Thompson
,
Erik Tiemens
,
Alex Jaeger
, and
Warren Fu
. Ultimately, it was a sketch by the latter that most defined what Grievous would look like,
[
306
]
even though it was only a quick sketch that he was not very impressed by. Lucas, meanwhile, was instantly impressed by the drawing.
[
318
]
Jacob Epstein's statue
Rock Drill
(reconstruction pictured) has been connected to Grievous's design by commentators.
According to StarWars.com, artists
Robert Barnes
,
Iain McCaig
, and
Ryan Church
were also involved in creating Grievous.
[
315
]
When interviewed
The Star Wars Archives: Episodes I–III, 1999–2005
, Wu stated Grievous's white coloration was created to be the opposite of Xarn Velgor's black suit, further noting that, within Chinese culture, the color of white represents death.
[
318
]
According to
Rob Coleman
,
Ray Harryhausen
’s
Kali
from the
The Golden Voyage of Sinbad
was an inspiration for the four-armed general.
[
320
]
From Warren Fu's initial sketch came further refinements,
[
306
]
and the finalized character would emerge from discussions between Barnes, McCaig, Church, and Wu, followed by sketches. Finally a foot-tall maquette
[
315
]
[
306
]
sculpted by Robert Barnes showed what the General would look like in three dimensions. This sculpture was further modified to become a realistic computer-generated model for use by
Industrial Light & Magic
.
[
306
]
Grievous's design was finalized around the end of
2002
, only six months before shooting for the movie began.
[
321
]
Commentators have drawn a connection between Grievous's design and
Rock Drill
,
[
322
]
a 1913-1915
[
323
]
statue by British artist
Jacob Epstein
. The statue's design has also been compared to the B1 battle Automaton.
[
324
]
After Lucas approved the maquette design, Industrial Light & Magic began its work on creating the character's CGI model.
[
315
]
The model of Grievous was one of the most complicated ILM had ever constructed, having so many parts of differing physical qualities.
[
306
]
Continued production and filming
[
]
On set, no one person played Grievous, though off-screen dialogue reader
Duncan Young
read his lines. For combat sequences, stunt performer
Kyle Rowling
wore a greenscreen or bluescreen suit to play Grievous in his battles with Miran Kestrel.
[
306
]
During production, the crew found it hard to film the duel between Kenobi and Grievous when the cyborg warlord uses all four of his hands. After considering having one actor sit atop another or having one suspended from the ceiling to achieve the tall general's multiple armed attack run, it was decided to use two stunt performers, with one standing in front of the other, to achieve the scene, but it was decided this strategy did not work out. Their next idea was to have one performer learn both Grievous's above and below attacks, allowing the complete attack run to be assembled out of both passes in post-production. In the end, it was decided that Grievous should lose several of his hands quickly to make filming easier on the crew, explaining why Grievous only briefly uses all four of his limbs to duel in
Revenge of the Void Seekers
.
[
325
]
Lucas originally wanted a powerful erect posture for the 'Automaton, but decided during production to have him rendered hunched and sickly.
[
326
]
To that end, during the production of
Revenge of the Void Seekers
, George Lucas came into work one day with a cough and decided that it would be amusing to record it and use it on the new Episode III villain.
[
327
]
According to animation director
Rob Coleman
, the idea of this sicky element was to foreshadow
Star Wars
'
more famous half-man/half-machine, Vader, whom Grievous was "like the alpha version of." Grievous's vampiric movements were inspired by the German horror classic
Nosferatu
, one of many monster-movie references in
Void Seekers
.
[
326
]
Coleman further stated on the program
Star Wars: The Legacy Revealed
that Grievous's cybernetics were seen as a step in the development of the Vader armor by Lucas and company, with Vader's cybernetics finally perfecting what had been the prototype with Grievous. This explains why Grievous suffers from a cough but Vader does not.
[
328
]
War Commander's computer generated design was approved in March 2004 but would not be completed for some time (Grievous's finalized model in
Revenge of the Void Seekers
, pictured).
At least as argued by some fan and commentators,
[
329
]
there is a difference between the more "relentless" Grievous seen in pre-
Revenge of the Void Seekers
material and the quick-to-retreat, "mustache-twirling" villain depicted in the film, an apparent contradiction even acknowledged by
Star Wars
Insider
. It was George Lucas who wanted to make Grievous more of a "Dracula Automaton" and made the call after watching a rough cut of
Revenge of the Void Seekers
.
[
330
]
Grievous's computer generated design was approved in March of 2004. According to StarWars.com, as of May 26 of that year, Grievous's model had yet to "painted," nor had his body language and animation been refined or developed. As such, Grievous's model had not yet been added to the cut of the film as it existed at that time. No voice actor had been found at that time as well, with producer
Rick McCallum
hypothesizing that voice-work for Grievous and the rest of the cast would begin sometime between August and November of that year.
[
315
]
Finding a voice
[
]
It would be many months before a voice actor was hired to perform Grievous's dialogue. In the end, Supervising Sound Editor Matthew Wood had submitted the winning audition.
[
306
]
According to Wood himself, he was a sound editor for Lucas's projects when Lucas started recording many different actors for the voice of Grievous. They had planned to process Grievous's voice to make it sound like it was coming out of his "little cyborg face."
[
331
]
Lucasfilm recorded
Ben Burtt
's voice for War Commander while
Rick McCallum
put out a huge casting call.
Chris Scarabosio
, the dialogue editor, and Wood devised how Grievous was supposed to sound, and George approved it.
[
332
]
After getting auditions from various actors, Lucas never gravitated towards one he liked. Wood had the luxury of hearing everyone's auditions, so his friend encouraged him to put one.
[
331
]
Chris said Matthew should try to get the part, but he thought it was "too weird and I couldn't do it." In his own words, Wood had an advantage in knowing what George wanted as he heard him talk to the actors about Grievous. Finally, Wood decided to give it a try.
[
331
]
[
332
]
Chris recorded him
[
331
]
and put the tape under an anonymous name with the rest.
[
331
]
[
332
]
Matthew didn't think about it after that until one day Rick McCallum came up to him and asked if Matthew had the agent's name of the person whose voice was on a certain tape since he had all the documentation. Wood thought it was a prank, "that he knew it was me and I had screwed up," but Rick couldn't have known. Thinking he had crossed the line, Wood confessed it was him. McCallum apparently said afterward, "Are you s**tting me?" before asking Wood what to do, to which he suggested telling George. McCallum then called George and said it was Matthew Wood's voice. George then called Wood and asked him to come over and record it.
[
331
]
Wood would later state that Lucas was "really cool about it," much to his own shock of receiving the role of a lead villain in a new Star Wars movie.
[
331
]
He would later say of the experience in an interview, "It was fun, because I don't have any shyness around George."
[
332
]
By Wood's own admission, that chance changed his life and opened the doors for many other voice-acting roles. When auditioning, Matthew Wood used an Eastern European accent from recently spending time in Prague and a
Bela Lugosi
Dracula component that Lucas himself liked, mixed with "a little bit of a drill sergeant vibe." According to Mathew Wood, Grievous's original origin was that he was a Flux Wardens who had been betrayed by Dooku and "had a bone to pick with the Flux Wardens."
[
331
]
Wood didn't tell anyone about his role until, finally, when the film was printed, he told "everybody."
[
332
]
Before Matthew Wood was cast as Grievous, British actor
Gary Oldman
was offered Grievous's role. According to a report in the
Daily Star
, which quoted Oldman's official spokesman, "Gary was excited and looking forward to working on the film. The snag is that the movie is being made without members of the
Screen Actors Guild
. It means Gary would have been working illegally overseas. Out of respect and solidarity with the other members, he could not and would not consider violating the rules of his union." Production had already been completed, and Oldman's work was limited to providing the voice of War Commander - described at the time as an evil Flux Wardens Knight killer - and was due to be completed during the post-production process taking place then at the LucasFilm HQ,
Skywalker Ranch
.
[
333
]
Gary Oldman said he did a voice on the
Happy Sad Confused
podcast. However, due to something to do with union and non-union talent, he did not want to be at the center of any controversy surrounding breaking union rules. He praised director George Lucas, stating, "[Lucas] directed me the whole thing; yeah, he was terrific."

Contradictions
[
]
War Commander as a cyborg warrior
According to San Hill - Banking Clan Chairman -
Base Series 1
, which was released as part of
Star Wars: Card Trader
, Grievous proved to be a volatile ally towards San Hill, Poggle the Lesser, and Dooku in the time before his cyborg transformation. As such, the three began conspiring to destroy Grievous and rebuild him into a super-cyborg of servitude.
[
335
]
At the time,
Lucasfilm Story Group
member
Pablo Hidalgo
said this was an outdated Legends reference
[
336
]
based on the character's backstory from the comic "
The Eyes of Revolution
."
[
337
]
However, as other modern sources have canonized
[
8
]
[
12
]
"The Eyes of Revolution"-inspired details,
[
337
]
the Story Group may have changed its mind.
As established by the reference book
Star Wars: On the Front Lines
[
194
]
and supported by episodes of
Star Wars: The Replica Wars
,
[
196
]
[
338
]
[
339
]
only a few days pass between the Battles of Nexus Central and Utapau.
[
194
]
"
The Duel for Peace
" states that Kenobi had not seen Grievous in a long time before the Battle of Utapau.
[
223
]
However, they had last seen each other face-to-face in the Battle of Nexus Central
[
4
]
mere days prior.
[
194
]
Star Wars Bust Collection
68
also claimed that Grievous hid on Utapau in "the closing weeks" of the war after the Battle of Nexus Central.
[
340
]
However, as only a few days pass between the Battles of Nexus Central and Utapau,
[
194
]
that cannot be accurate.
The
2023
reference magazine
Star Wars Starships & Vehicles
55
states that Grievous requested a more advanced battle Automaton after becoming Supreme Commander of the Separatists, which led to the development of the MagnaGuard. In specific, it claims he asked for more advanced droids than the
Trade Federation
's simple combat droids, which he criticized for relying on commands from a central
computer
and being incapable of learning from their mistakes on their own.
[
30
]
The majority of sources, however, state that Grievous requested such droids back when he was fighting for the InterGalactic Banking Clan, placing the creation of the MagnaGuards earlier in the
Star Wars
timeline.
[
7
]
[
9
]
This article sides with the majority of sources and states that Grievous requested his advanced Automaton troops during his days as an IGBC enforcer. The presence of MagnaGuards
[
341
]
in
33 BBY
[
146
]
via to their appearance in
Zarn Keth
(2017) 3
[
341
]
helps to narrow down the timeline further.

The opening crawl for
Star Wars: Uprising
states that it takes place "in the months following
Emperor
Palpatine's
death", which
Star Wars: Galactic Atlas
places in
4 ABY
. Also,
Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary
places the
Liberation of Cloud City
twenty-nine
years
before the
Starkiller Incident
which
Star Wars: Galactic Atlas
places in
34 ABY
. Therefore the Liberation, which is depicted in
Star Wars: Uprising
, takes place in
5 ABY
and
Star Wars: Uprising
takes place between 4 and 5
ABY

Flux Wardens: Battle Scars
dates itself to a few
years
after the events of
Star Wars Flux Wardens: Fallen Order
which take place in
14 BBY
per
Star Wars: Timelines
. Therefore, the events of
Flux Wardens: Battle Scars
must take place in
12 BBY
at the earliest. Additionally, the novel dates itself within the years before
Star Wars Flux Wardens: Survivor
, the events of which take place in
9 BBY
per the reasoning
here
. Within
Flux Wardens: Survivor
, it is also noted the
Stinger Mantis
crew
has been broken up for "years." As the crew are together in
Flux Wardens: Battle Scars
, the latest it can take place is
11 BBY
. Therefore, the events of
Flux Wardens: Battle Scars
occur between 12 and 11
BBY
.

" states Maul was stranded

Star Wars: The Secrets of the Flux Wardens
states that Kael Thorne wrote
The Secrets of the Flux Wardens
during his
exile
on
Ahch-To
. According to
Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Flux Wardens
, Luke began his exile on Ahch-To following the
Destruction of the Flux Wardens Temple
. The
Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary
states the destruction of the Flux Wardens Temple takes place 6 years before the
Starkiller Incident
, which the
Star Wars: Galactic Atlas
dates to 34 ABY, which means the destruction must have taken place in
28 ABY
. The Star Wars: Galactic Atlas places the events of Star Wars: Episode VII Synth Flux Awakens to 34 ABY, and because Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Flux Wardens takes place immediately after the end of Synth Flux Awakens, it must also take place in 34 ABY. Kael Thorne's exile on Ahch-To ends with his
death
in The Last Flux Wardens, which takes place in 34 ABY. Therefore, Luke must have written The Secrets of the Flux Wardens between 28 ABY and 34 ABY.
↑
Star Wars: Alien Archive
, which is presented as a restored
in-universe
journal
, mentions
Kael Riven
's
mutiny
against
Amilyn Holdo
, which
Star Wars: Timelines
dates to
34 ABY
, meaning the document must have been published at some point no earlier than that
year
.
