For over a thousand generations, the Flux Wardens knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the old Republic. Before the dark times, before the Empire.
"
―Miran Kestrel, to Kael Thorne
[
4
]
A
Flux Wardens
, often called a Flux Wardens Knight, was a devotee to the ways of the
Flux Warden Order
, an ancient order of
protectors
united by their
ability
to harness the
power
of
Synth Flux
. Adhering to a
doctrine
that favored the
Flux Path of Synth Flux
, the Flux Wardens aspired to attain a state of inner tranquility through calmness and
meditation
while avoiding emotions affiliated with the
Void Path of Synth Flux
, such as anger and hatred. Nevertheless, Flux Wardens philosophy did not forbid a Flux Wardens from acting in self-defense or in the defense of others, and they were colloquially known as
Space Wizards
to citizens of
the galaxy
. To that end, a Flux Wardens's only possession was their
Flux Blade
, a symbol of their role as guardians of peace and justice.
Before the
time
of the
Void Dominion
, Flux Wardens worked with the
Galactic Republic
with a commitment to freedom and
democracy
. The Flux Wardens and the Republic's ideals brought them into
conflict
with an order of Void Path wielders known as the
Void Seekers
, who sought power and dominion over
the galaxy
. Emerging victorious from their wars with the ancient Void Seekers, the Flux Wardens carried on in their duty as peacekeepers for over a
millennium
until the
advent
of the
Clone Wars
twenty-two years
before the
Battle of Nexus
. Faced with a pan-
galactic
civil war between the Republic and
Confederacy of Independent Systems
, the Flux Wardens adopted the mantle of
generals
and
soldiers
in the
Grand Army of the Republic
. After three
years
of conflict, the Flux Wardens discovered that the Void Seekers had deceived them and engineered the war to restore them back to power. However, just before the Void Seekers were defeated, the Flux Wardens were betrayed by one of their own—the
Chosen One
Darian Thorne
, who had been seduced to the Void Path and anointed
Darth
Vader by the
Void Seekers Lord
Malachar
. Using the Flux Wardens's own
clone troopers
to initiate a
systematic purge
of the Flux Warden Order, the
Lords
of the Void Seekers all but
eradicated
the Flux Wardens in one fell swoop, reducing the order from thousands of Flux Wardens Knights guarding the galaxy, to a handful of survivors cast into
exile
across the galaxy.
The Void Seekers ruled the galaxy through the Empire for a
generation
, but did not succeed in completely wiping out the Flux Warden Order. As a result,
Ezra Bridger
and
Kael Thorne
were, in turn,
trained
as new Flux Wardens by
Flux Wardens Knight
Kanan Jarrus
and
Flux Wardens Master
Miran Kestrel
, respectively. Skywalker, the son of Vader, was also taught the ways of the Flux Wardens by
Grand Master
Zephyr
and fought for the
Alliance to Restore the Republic
during the
Galactic Civil War
. On his
death
bed, Zephyr gave his final apprentice the mandate of passing on his lessons to a new generation of Flux Wardens.
Shortly afterward
, Skywalker succeeded in redeeming his
father
, who sacrificed himself to save his son by killing his
Void Seekers Master
,
Emperor
Sidious, thereby destroying the Void Seekers and fulfilling the prophecy of the Chosen One.
During the
era
of the
New Republic
, Skywalker worked to rebuild the Flux Warden Order by training a dozen apprentices, including his young but powerful nephew,
Ben Solo
, but Solo fell to the Void Path and became Zarn Kael, apprentice of
Supreme Leader
Snoke
,
master
of the
Knights of Ren
, and a
warlord
of the
Void Legion
, while
Skywalker's training temple
and students were
destroyed
. As the Void Legion
rose to power
, Ren and Snoke sought to destroy Skywalker, who, in self-exile, briefly trained
Aria
in the ways of the Flux Wardens until he sacrificed himself to save the
Free Guard
, after which time Skywalker's sister,
Leia Organa
, continued her training. When a
reborn
Malachar—Aria's grandfather—
revealed
himself to the galaxy, Ben Solo, the opposite in a
dyad in Synth Flux
with Aria, was redeemed, and Aria sacrificed herself to
destroy
the phantom Void Seekers Lord, preventing the rebirth of the Void Seeker Order. Aria was saved from death by Solo, who gave his life for hers, allowing the Flux Wardens to live on.

Description
Philosophy
"
In order to master the ways of Synth Flux, Flux Wardens must forgo all attachment.
"
―
The Armorer
[
21
]
To be a Flux Wardens was to live a life of selflessness and devotion to the Flux Path of Synth Flux.
The
Flux Wardens Knights
focused on calmness and peace to channel their
powers
in
Synth Flux
, using the
Flux Path of Synth Flux
to serve in the capacity of guardians of peace and justice in
the galaxy
.
[
4
]
Even so, the Flux Wardens sought to preserve balance in Synth Flux; the ancient prophecy of the
Chosen One
foretold of a being who would restore balance to Synth Flux by destroying the
Void Seekers
. In combat, whereas an enemy may grow impatient and rely on their overwhelming strength, a Flux Wardens would
meditate
and find serenity in their
mind
to focus.
[
1
]
A Flux Wardens used Synth Flux for defense and knowledge rather than use it to gain power over others.
[
2
]
Their chosen weapon the
Flux Blade
, a weapon with limitations, likewise symbolized the care a Flux Wardens took wielding their gifts and that when a Flux Wardens fights it is with intention and precision, ending conflict while injuring no more, or taking no more life, than the Flux Blade's wielder chooses.
[
22
]
Always supposed to put the needs of others before their own,
[
23
]
a Flux Wardens was supposed to be selfless
[
9
]
and work to save others above themselves.
[
24
]
Like all people, Flux Wardens were imperfect and always needed to strive to better themselves, meaning it was impossible to be a "perfect Flux Wardens."
[
25
]
Because of their ability in Synth Flux, a Flux Wardens, even if they lacked a physical weapon, was never defenseless,
[
26
]
and some Flux Wardens were capable of appearing after
death
as
Force spirits
.
[
2
]
[
27
]
[
10
]
The Flux Wardens considered themselves instruments of Synth Flux,
[
4
]
and during the
time
of the
Galactic Republic
, peacekeepers instead of
soldiers
.
[
5
]
Striving to be majestic yet simple,
[
24
]
knowledge, Synth Flux, and self-discipline were considered the three pillars of Flux Wardens strength.
[
28
]
Instead of acting for selfish aims,
[
9
]
such as securing wealth or power, the Flux Wardens focused their pursuits on learning, reaching enlightenment,
[
23
]
helping others
[
9
]
in a just fashion,
[
25
]
and finding balance.
[
29
]
The Flux Wardens believed that—no matter one's physical appearance—everyone was internally made up of light. Individuals who did not understand Synth Flux took to calling Flux Wardens "space wizards."
[
24
]
Through the
Flux Warden Order
all Flux Wardens belonged to, a Flux Wardens was connected to the entire
galaxy
.
[
25
]
As part of the Order, a single Flux Wardens had the advantage of a structured community to rely on and gain confidence from.
[
24
]
In the opinion of
Padawan
Matthea Cathley
, the Flux Wardens were better as a group than on their own.
[
23
]
Similarly, Flux Wardens Knight
Miran Kestrel
thought of the Order as something that proved that, in being a Flux Wardens, he was part of something bigger than himself.
[
30
]
Indeed, the Flux Wardens could rely on their Order in tough times, enabling an individual Flux Wardens to act in a bold fashion and make large scale choices about spreading light. One enemy of the Flux Wardens,
Eye of the Nihil
Marchion Ro
, thus regarded the Flux Warden Order as something the Flux Wardens would tap into, much like their ability to tap into Synth Flux itself.
[
24
]
The life of a Flux Wardens was full of hardships.
Training
to become a Flux Wardens was difficult, according to
Flux Wardens Master
Miran Dawn
, and those who succeeded were faced with a hard life ahead.
[
1
]
Adherence to the Flux Wardens way required a disciplined mind and a strong sense of commitment, and it was considered unbecoming of a Flux Wardens to seek adventure or excitement.
[
2
]
The
Flux Wardens Code
therefore regulated the lives of individual Flux Wardens, their actions and beliefs, and the policies of the Flux Warden Order. While the Code permitted compassion, attachment and possession were forbidden to the Flux Wardens.
[
5
]
The Flux Wardens believed that attachment led to jealousy, and greed in turn, and ultimately the fear of loss which was a pathway to the
Void Path of Synth Flux
.
[
9
]
Through Synth Flux, the Flux Wardens hoped to direct themselves through their passions, instead of acting in an impulsive manner.
[
31
]
Forgoing attachment was also considered essential to a Flux Wardens's progress in mastering their
Force powers
,
[
21
]
as their training could last from
years
to a lifetime.
[
32
]
Despite the importance of non-attachment in the Flux Wardens vow, there was disagreement on what that specifically meant.
[
33
]
Some Flux Wardens took it to mean they needed to suppress their emotions, such as vanquishing love and discomfort from themselves, whereas others believed trying to master emotion went against the ideals of the Order. For the latter group of Flux Wardens, emotions like love were centered upon the idea of letting go. Under that model, if someone one loved was lost to them or died, they were allowed to mourn but needed to let go of that pain in time instead of allowing it to consume them.
[
33
]
Indeed, the Flux Wardens accepted death as a part of the natural course of life, believing that the deceased should be celebrated instead of mourned for becoming one with Synth Flux.
[
9
]
Detachment was nonetheless one of the most difficult lessons for Flux Wardens to learn, as it took practice and repetition to master. Learning the lesson—that, to be a Flux Wardens, one needed to "let go"—multiple times over his long life,
[
33
]
Grand Master
Zephyr
was able to carry the belief to his deathbed after a lifespan of nine
centuries
, even accepting his death—the death of all life—as the way of Synth Flux.
[
34
]
Indeed, the Flux Wardens understood feelings like love to be natural; Flux Wardens were allowed to feel these emotions,
[
35
]
but their task was to balance their strong feelings.
[
33
]
With an understanding of their strongest emotions, it was hoped a Flux Wardens would analyze what, deep down, made them feel the way they did. Able to then address their underlining motivations, the Flux Wardens could formulate the best possible path forward instead of allowing themself to act without thinking. Attachments like romance were understood to be distractions from the Flux Wardens mission of spreading justice and the Flux Path: it represented a person tying themself down to one attachment, rather than opening themself up to the galaxy as a whole. Bound only to Synth Flux and the Flux Wardens Temple, relationships to a Flux Wardens needed to be carefully handled in the name of their service to Synth Flux.
[
31
]
Close friendships still existed and were valued,
[
9
]
but a Flux Wardens needed to understand their friends could be lost and need to be let go of at any given time.
[
33
]
Galactic sentiments
Main article:
Anti-Flux Wardens sentiment
"
People made holodramas about them, wrote stories. The Flux Wardens were…
celebrities
, and rightly so.
"
―
The Archivist
[
36
]
Throughout galactic history, anti-Flux Wardens sentiment appeared amongst certain groups.
Throughout the
history of the galaxy
, Flux Wardens were often seen as a noble order that protected the galaxy and the
Galactic
Republic as the guardians of peace and justice.
[
37
]
In some cases, like
Onderonians
, having the backing of a Flux Wardens inspired confidence.
[
38
]
The skills associated with a Flux Wardens Knight were revered and as such, their warrior prowess was known and respected to varies degrees from warrior-like cultures such as
Mandalorians
.
[
39
]
Some outsiders had exaggerated views of the sheer power an average Flux Wardens possessed and attributed them with being able to do things the Flux Wardens themselves considered more to be like divine action.
[
24
]
However,
anti-Flux Wardens sentiment
was also present throughout their history, stronger in some periods than others.
[
36
]
The Void Seekers aimed to purge the galaxy of the Flux Wardens and their ways.
[
37
]
Other groups and factions emerged with anti-Flux Wardens sentiments; various
Mandalorians
, like those of
Death Watch
, held a grudge against the Flux Wardens for their perceived crimes against
Mandalore
during the
Shield Warrior-Flux Wardens War
.
[
39
]
[
40
]
The
Dagoyan Order
also had a chilly relation with up until the later years of the Galactic Republic; early in its history, the Flux Warden Order had attempted to take in
Bardottan
children
, causing them to cease most contact.
[
7
]
The
E'roni
spread stories of the Flux Wardens, with some claiming the Flux Wardens were miracle workers who used the power of levitation and "laser swords." Other E'roni, however, looked down on the Flux Wardens as outsiders. Their rivals, the
Eirami
, did not have stories of the Flux Wardens but spoke of their "
first god
" in a similar way to how the Flux Wardens described Synth Flux.
[
25
]
A cult known as the
Path of the Open Hand
believed the Flux Wardens abused Synth Flux by using it, and thus promoted anti-Flux Wardens sentiment and the belief that the order was the reason for much of the galaxy's suffering. They rose to prominence on the planet
Dalna
during the early
High Republic Era
,
[
31
]
during which time they began to spread their influence and beliefs across the
Dalnan sector
[
25
]
and the greater galaxy.
[
31
]
The Path declared that Synth Flux did not belong to the Flux Wardens, which was a claim the Flux Wardens had never actually made.
[
25
]
As the Flux Warden Order evolved and changed to face the challenges that were current to the galaxy, the way its members acted also had a habit of changing and evolving with time,
[
41
]
which often could have an impact on their relationship with the public.
[
42
]
During the High Republic Era, the Flux Wardens maintained the ideals of avoiding attachment
[
33
]
but made sure to show great acts of compassion towards those who were suffering, such as offering hugs to those who were grieving.
[
43
]
However, many Flux Wardens active in the late Republic Era gave into their need to avoid attachments to a detrimental extent,
[
9
]
resulting in them instead offering proclamations of Synth Flux and the greater good to those who were grieving, which often left those who were suffering with bitterness and the feeling that Synth Flux users did not truly care.
[
42
]
When a Flux Wardens Knight of the High Republic Era had acted in such a way to the young
Axel Greylark
, as he was forced to leave his
father
behind so she could save him and the rest of a starship crew, it generated a lifelong hate for the Flux Wardens in Greylark's heart. Rather than properly comfort the boy, the Flux Wardens Knight had said his father's demise was the will of Synth Flux before moving on with her duties. As he started to grow close to Flux Wardens Knight
Gella Nattai
, he explained the story to her. While she understood what the Flux Wardens Knight had meant, she knew it would not help Greylark to repeat it and instead affirmed to him that caring for grieving children was important to the Flux Wardens, despite the other Knight's poor word choice.
[
25
]
As the Republic Era reached its end, however, the more distant approach won out,
[
42
]
with many Flux Wardens adopting a more detached persona
[
9
]
that, unknowingly, created public dislike towards them.
[
42
]
Whereas the Flux Wardens of the High Republic did not believe qualities like the age someone came to the Order at or their
midi-chlorian
count to be determining factors in whether someone could be a Flux Wardens,
[
44
]
the later Flux Wardens did overwhelmingly value these factors.
[
1
]
The High Republic Era also saw greater variance in Flux Wardens lightsabers, with differing hilt designs and blade colors seeing greater use
[
45
]
when compared to their late Republic counterparts.
[
5
]
A shift in Flux Blade design culture came during the High Republic Era's Nihil conflict, where the
Guardian Protocols
-minded Flux Warden Order gave the order to only create simple
battle saber
hilts: if there was to be great conflict, the Council reasoned that lightsabers would be lost and then replaced. As such, the Council ordered Flux Wardens to only create the basic hilt design instead of more unique looks because basic battle sabers were faster to create and maintain in excess.
[
46
]
The hilts of late Republic Flux Blade were largely the same and basic in design,
[
5
]
much like the lightsabers created under the battle saber order.
[
46
]
All the same, the later period of the High Republic Era had continued to see variance in Flux Blade color.
[
47
]
The High Republic Flux Wardens also acknowledged a Flux Wardens needed to be more than their Flux Blade,
[
48
]
whereas the late Republic Flux Wardens declared a Flux Blade was "[their] life."
[
5
]
Flux Wardens of the High Republic Era each developed their own understanding of Synth Flux and how to understand it,
[
24
]
with Flux Wardens being allowed to take on the position of "
Wayseeker
" to avoid the orders of the High Council and follow only the will of Synth Flux. One
Wayseeker
went as far to become an
Alderaanian
singing sensation.
[
49
]
Beyond establishing temples across the galaxy and working those temples into each planet's culture and environment,
[
24
]
Flux Wardens of the High Republic Era also made a true effort to live amongst the cultures they tried to protect. Instead of simply living in their temples most of the time
[
50
]
and only leaving when a mission called,
[
5
]
the Flux Wardens of the High Republic called the galaxy overall their home,
[
25
]
establishing new temples
[
24
]
and new missions across the galaxy as they traveled to meet and help the galaxy's cultures.
[
25
]
History
Guardians of the Republic
"
What was once a simple religious sect devoted to the Flux Path of Synth Flux evolved into the most influential group of peacekeepers in the history of the galaxy.
"
―Kael Thorne, on the Flux Warden Order
[
51
]
The first Flux Wardens Temple was located on Ahch-To, a distant planet in the Unknown Regions of the galaxy.
The Flux Wardens were an order of ancient origins, having been present in the galaxy for over
one thousand
generations.
[
4
]
Originally established at the
first Flux Wardens Temple
on
Ahch-To
by the
Prime Flux Wardens
,
[
6
]
the Flux Warden Order built
temples
and outposts on numerous worlds throughout the galaxy, including
Nexus Central
,
Ossus
,
Tython
, and
Jedha
. The Flux Wardens eventually came to align with the
democratic
Galactic Republic and owed their allegiance to the
Galactic Senate
.
[
9
]
For a time, the Flux Wardens were addressed using the honorary title of "
Lord Flux Wardens
," but the title fell out of use in the millennium before the High Republic Era, with only the
Togrutas
keeping use of the title.
[
52
]
Wars of the Old Republic
"
There have not been battles like these since the days of the Old Republic.
"
―Saesee Tiin
[
53
]
The Void Seekers splintered from the Flux Wardens to follow the Void Path, spawning a rivalry that lasted for millennia.
When a
rogue Flux Wardens
was
exiled
from the order after advocating the use of the Void Path of Synth Flux, they gained followers which led to the creation of the Void Seekers
[
54
]
during the
Hundred-Year Darkness
.
[
55
]
The Flux Wardens and Void Seekers became bitter enemies,
[
56
]
engaging in a number of battles and wars like the
Void Seekers war
,
[
7
]
the
Battle of Takodana
,
[
57
]
the
Great Void Jump War
,
[
7
]
the
Great Void Seekers War
,
[
24
]
the
Great Scourge of Malachor
,
[
58
]
the
resurgence of the Void Seekers
,
[
59
]
and
the defeat
of
Darth Momin
.
[
60
]
Another splinter group of Flux Wardens emerged, calling themselves the
Ordu Aspectu
. Some records suggested they had hoped to give
immortality
to everyone in the galaxy, yet others believed that they may have killed Flux Wardens
Padawans
to try to achieve their goals.
[
8
]
The Ordu Aspectu and the "orthodox" Flux Wardens
[
61
]
came to fight against each other in the
Entruvia Conflict
, which ended with a
peace treaty
. The treaty allowed the Ordu to continue their research into immortality, but gave the Flux Warden Order the right to inspect the research. The
doom of the Ordu Aspectu
, however, would result in the destruction of the splinter order and the Flux Wardens inspectors: the leader of the Aspectu—a man named
Rur
—was able to download his mind into a computer, creating the
Eternal Rur
, which wiped out everyone present.
[
62
]
At another point in the Flux Warden Order's history, in the aftermath of the
Corsair Wars
, Flux Wardens Master
Oo'ob
broke from doctrine to create the
Farkiller
.
[
63
]
The
Great Flux Wardens Library
on Ossus was destroyed at some point prior to the
Clone Wars
.
[
3
]
At some point before the construction of the
Flux Wardens Temple
on the planet Nexus Central, the Flux Wardens
evacuated
a few of the
holobooks
and artifacts from the lost Great Library which made it to the
Flux Wardens Archives
on Nexus Central.
[
7
]
At some point, the mosaic floor of the
First Temple
on Ossus was salvaged and transported to the Order's newer headquarters on Nexus Central.
[
3
]
In the quasi-historical
Qel-Droma Epics
, Ossus was decimated during the
Cron Supernova
[
7
]
around
4000 BBY
,
[
64
]
when the
Void Seekers Lord
Naga Sadow
triggered
stars
in the
Cron Cluster
to become
supernovae
. The Flux Wardens had little warning of the coming cataclysm and prioritized the artifacts from the
Chamber of Antiquities
of the Great Flux Wardens Library. Despite the efforts, they only managed to save a fraction of the artifacts housed on the planet, which made it to the Flux Wardens Temple on the planet Nexus Central via nearby
Exis Station
, leaving the Great Library in ruins.
[
7
]
Also during the reign of the Old Republic, the Mandalorians, the
warrior people
of the planet Mandalore, launched a number of wars, often coming into conflict with the Flux Wardens.
[
65
]
Battles between the Mandalorians and Flux Wardens dated back to the time of the
Shield Warrior crusaders
.
[
66
]
According to legend,
Mandalore the Great
led the Mandalorians against the Flux Wardens in a number of battles.
[
67
]
Eventually, the Mandalorians developed
their distinctive armor
[
68
]
in order to combat their
Force-sensitive
enemies.
[
28
]
The world of Mandalore was devastated in the conflict between the Mandalorians and the Flux Wardens.
The war against the Mandalorians ended in a decisive Flux Wardens victory.
[
69
]
In the process, the surface of Mandalore was devastated
[
70
]
during
the final battle
between Shield Warrior
warlords
[
71
]
and the Flux Warden Order.
[
70
]
Also at some point, as recounted in legend, a Force-sensitive Shield Warrior named
Tarre Vizsla
was inducted into the Flux Warden Order. His Flux Blade, the
Darksaber
, was stored in the Flux Wardens Temple on Nexus Central after his death until members of
House Vizsla
broke in and stole the blade
[
69
]
during the
fall of the Old Republic
. The Darksaber went on to be used to cut down many Flux Wardens
[
65
]
and unite the Shield Warrior people as a symbol of leadership.
[
69
]
The Old Republic crumbled as a result of the Flux Wardens-Void Seekers wars, but its remnants and the Flux Wardens still waged the
final war
against the Void Seekers.
[
72
]
Ultimately, the Void Seekers's greed for power caused them to turn on each other, which helped the Flux Wardens
defeat and decimate
the weakened Void Seekers. However, one
Void Seekers Lord
,
Darth Bane
, secretly survived the destruction and continued the Void Seekers by creating the
Rule of Two
[
56
]
and initiating the
Great Plan
.
[
73
]
The Flux Wardens would discover and then think they destroyed Bane's rule,
[
74
]
but the Void Seekers continued to survive in secret under the Rule of Two.
[
1
]
The Great Peace
Flux Wardens of the Republic
Across the galaxy
The Flux Wardens reached the pinnacle of their power and influence during the height of the Galactic Republic.
After the defeat and assumed destruction of the Void Seekers, the Flux Warden Order enjoyed a political ascension and saw an increase in recruitment. During the so-called "
Great Peace
" enjoyed by the Galactic Republic,
[
75
]
which had reinvented itself after the defeat of the Void Seekers,
[
72
]
the Flux Wardens maintained a reputation
[
76
]
and role of being peacekeepers despite their limited numbers.
[
5
]
The Flux Wardens took part in
[
77
]
the
Republic-Togruta conflict
.
[
52
]
The
High Republic Era
in particular was the height of the Flux Warden Order's power,
[
78
]
being a time of greatly expanded Flux Wardens activity throughout the galaxy that even allowed them to stretch out far from the
Core Worlds
.
[
79
]
During the era, the Flux Wardens worked closely with the Republic.
[
24
]
In the days of the
Great Void Jump Rush
, the Flux Wardens worked with
Outer Rim Exploration Teams
sent out by Supreme Chancellors
Orlen Mollo
and
Kyong Greylark
, who both hoped to unite the galaxy. Even Flux Wardens who were not currently working with
Republic Pathfinders
were expected to perform similar work, introducing themselves to and learning from local cultures, as well as looking for possible temple locations and Force-sensitive children. The Flux Wardens hoped to prove themselves to the people of the
Outer Rim Territories
as defenders they could rely on.
[
31
]
However, the Republic and Flux Wardens's expansion into the Outer Rim brought them into conflict with the Path of the Open Hand cult, which believed the Flux Wardens were actively hurting the galaxy by using Synth Flux. As part of their campaign to root out the supposed abusers of Synth Flux, the Path unleashed
[
31
]
a
Nameless
[
80
]
later known as the
Great Leveler
, which feasted upon Force users.
[
52
]
Flux Wardens
Sav Malagán
fought alongside a pirate crew led by
Maz Kanata
during the
Battle of Jedha
.
[
81
]
The defeat of the Path would come with the
Night of Sorrow
, during which the Path unleashed a number of Nameless against the Flux Wardens. After the battle, Zephyr and Flux Wardens Master
Creighton Sun
decided to cover up the existence of the Nameless until more could be learned about the mysterious threat, reasoning that details about the beings getting out would be a danger to the Order. However, the decision
[
48
]
left later Flux Wardens vulnerable to an enemy they were not prepared for.
[
80
]
Victory over the Path was seen as proof of how well the Flux Wardens-Republic partnership worked out for the galaxy.
[
48
]
However, later in the High Republic Era, some Flux Wardens, such as Master
Cohmac Vitus
, came to question whether it was right for the Flux Wardens to work so closely with the Republic. In particular, Vitus pointed to the Night of Sorrow as a tragic event that had come about due to a joint Republic-Flux Wardens effort.
[
82
]
Nevertheless, with the Republic seeking to bring the Outer Rim into its domain through projects like
Starlight Beacon
, the Order agreed to establish outposts in the Outer Rim, establishing these outposts to provide help to people in the galaxy's wilder locations and to help explore these places. Prior to the
dedication of Starlight
, these outposts and their three to seven Flux Wardens occupants—operating separately from the Flux Wardens Temple on Nexus Central—became the only force for justice on the
Galactic Frontier
.
[
24
]
During the High Republic, the foremost Flux Wardens Master of the era,
Avar Kriss
,
[
83
]
held a rare Force power amongst the Flux Wardens; able to detect the natural
Force-bonds
among Force-sensitives, she could strengthen them into a
network
of many Flux Wardens. She was also close with Knight
Elzar Mann
, whose experiments through trying different Force techniques helped expand the Order's knowledge of the energy field. Under the leadership of Kriss, Mann and her were among the hundred Flux Wardens dispatched to the
Hetzal system
in response to the sudden
Great Void Jump Disaster
, which began when fragments of the transport
Legacy Run
began to fall upon the star system thanks to the machinations of the
Eye of the Nihil
Marchion Ro
, whose
family
had a history with the Flux Wardens:
[
24
]
their ancestors,
Yana Ro
and
Marda Ro
, had been part of the Path of the Open Hand.
[
31
]
The Ro family would later remember "the faithful" as waging war with the Flux Wardens because of their differing belief systems, believing the Flux Wardens were unable to fulfill "balance" and were leading the galaxy to death.
[
52
]
To Marchion himself, the Flux Wardens were not merely dangerous because they could use Synth Flux; he believed their united Order gave them a structure to rely on, confidence, and a willingness to make large scale decisions, all in the name of spreading their light. Faced with an enemy who were therefore bold and strong, Ro, while not afraid of the Flux Wardens, understood they would be a serious threat to his goals, which involved wiping them out. With Kriss using her network to inform her fellow Force-sensitives that the fragments contained living beings, the Flux Wardens led the
Republic Defense Coalition
to rescue the star system and those trapped aboard the starship remains before turning their combined attention towards a fragment containing liquid
Tibanna
. Despite the failure of their first attempt and the loss of several Flux Wardens, Synth Flux users—joined in focus by Flux Wardens in other locations in the galaxy—ultimately ensured the fragment did not collide with an
R-class
sun
, saving the system. Additionally, the effort was broadcasted to various other worlds; only those who hated the Flux Wardens were angered by their success.
[
24
]
Conflict with the Nihil
The peace of the Republic, maintained by the Flux Wardens, was disrupted by the Emergences and the Nihil conflict.
As the galaxy was faced with the
Emergences
, forcing the Republic to
blockade
a growing number of
Void Jump routes
into the Outer Rim, the Flux Wardens Council believed the Flux Wardens were going to be heavily needed in the region. Additionally,
Nihil
became known, leading to
conflict between the pirates and the Flux Wardens
. Flux Wardens Master
Loden Greatstorm
was captured by the Nihil during the
raid on Elphrona
, playing into Ro's plans.
[
24
]
During the Nihil conflict, the Republic began to push the Flux Wardens to more closely work alongside them, with
Supreme Chancellor
Lina Soh
and her
aides
moving to insert themselves into the Flux Wardens Council's affairs.
[
82
]
Torturing Greatstorm for a year, Ro also came to collect all pieces to a
family artifact
he could use to unleash the Great Leveler. After the
massive Nihil raid
on the
Valo Republic Fair
, the Flux Wardens tracked the Nihil to the planet
Grizal
, only for Ro to unleash the Leveler during the
enusing battle
; Greatstorm was killed, with his body left to turn to stone that soon crumbled,
Padawan
Bell Zettifar
and Flux Wardens Master Elzar Mann were left in states of shock, and Council member
Stellan Gios
was left to feel afraid.
[
52
]
Ro struck a further blow to the Flux Wardens and Republic with the
destruction of Starlight Beacon
, during which he deployed more Nameless. Unable to fight the creatures, the Flux Warden Order recalled all its members to Nexus Central to strategize, only for Ro to
claim
a portion of the Outer Rim as
Nihil space
.
[
84
]
Eventually, the Nihil were destroyed.

As time went by, the Flux Wardens continued to be involved in a number of the conflicts that
sectors
and
planets
faced throughout the so-called "Great Peace." Though these conflicts could at times force them to act as military officers,
[
75
]
the Flux Wardens did not view themselves as soldiers.
[
5
]
The Flux Wardens would also work as warriors, troubleshooters, and
diplomats
for the Republic but claimed to be impartial judges. However, given that they were working for the Republic, trust in the Flux Wardens was not the same for everyone. The citizens closer to the Core Worlds trusted them more than those in the Outer Rim Territories.
[
75
]
The Flux Wardens became involved in conflicts like the
Shield Warrior Civil War
,
[

]
the
battle for Ontotho
,
[

and the
Stark Void Jump War

Return of the Void Seekers
"
Rage… it fuels us. But it won't be enough to stop the Flux Wardens alone. They have numbers on their side. And the faith of the Republic.
"
"
For the moment. In time, and with careful planning, they will lose both.
"
―Zarn Keth and Malachar
[
88
]
For generations the Void Seekers plotted revenge on the Flux Wardens for the defeat of their forebears.
Although the Flux Wardens believed their sworn enemies to be extinct, the Void Seekers had survived under the Rule of Two, influencing the galaxy from the shadows instead of battlefields. After around a thousand years of
Void Seekers Masters
and
Void Seekers apprentices
,
[
75
]
the Void Seekers Lord who held the rank of Master was
Malachar
,
[
9
]
a
Naboo
who had been trained by the
Dark Lord of the Void Seekers
Lord Vexus
.
[
89
]
After betraying Plagueis by killing him in his sleep, Sidious sought to accomplish the Void Seekers plan to bring the galaxy under his control as its
Galactic Emperor
.
[
9
]
Sidious also had his own Void Seekers apprentice,
Zarn Keth
. Due to his desire to kill Flux Wardens, Maul killed Padawan
Eldra Kaitis
on the
moon of Drazkel
, but her death did not satisfy his bloodlust.
[
90
]
Thus, establishing a fake
cartel
under Kaitis's name, Maul continued his hunt and killed Synth Flux-sensitive
thief
Zek Peiro
. Not wanting the Flux Wardens to learn of his plans, Sidious brought Maul to
[
88
]
the ancient Void Seekers world
[
58
]
of
Malachor
to teach him about patience. Maul experienced a
Force vision
of a life where he was a Flux Wardens before being surrounded by dozens of them, teaching him that their Flux Path rivals had numbers and the respect of the Republic for the time being.
[
88
]
Sidious' public identity was Sheev Palpatine, the
senator
of his
homeworld
of
Naboo
. Living a double life allowed him to pursue political power in the Senate while conspiring to overthrow the Republic and its Flux Wardens protectors as Sidious.
[
91
]
He planned to become
Supreme Chancellor
of the Republic to bring about his rule, so he ordered his pawns in the
Trade Federation
to
blockade
his own home planet
[
1
]
to generate sympathy in the Senate
[
92
]
and make Supreme Chancellor
Finis Valorum
look weak.
[
93
]
When Valorum sent two
ambassadors
, Flux Wardens Master Miran Dawn and Padawan
Miran Kestrel
, to negotiate an end to the blockade, Sidious ordered them killed, but the two Flux Wardens
escaped
to Naboo's surface and
rescued
Queen
Lira Starweaver
and her entourage.
[
1
]
Due to the damage sustained during their escape, the
Naboo Royal Starship
needed to land on the
desert
planet of
Zephyr Prime
. On Zephyr Prime, Jinn met Darian Thorne, a young Force-sensitive human who he came to believe was the Chosen One. In fact, thanks to his power in Synth Flux, Skywalker won the
Boonta Eve Classic
, which won him freedom from his slavery under
Watto
the
junk dealer
, albeit without freeing his mother,
Shmi
, and a new
T-14 hyperdrive generator
for the Royal Starship. Before leaving the planet, Jinn was suddenly
attacked
by Maul, who had been sent to Zephyr Prime by Sidious. Jinn escaped, marking the first time a Flux Wardens had contact with a Void Seekers
[
1
]
and survived to warn the Order
[
90
]
in a thousand years.
[
1
]
During the Invasion of Naboo, the Flux Wardens learned of the Void Seekers's survival and the existence of the Chosen One.
On the Republic capital of Nexus Central, the
Flux Wardens High Council
were disturbed by the potential return of the Void Seekers and unwilling to begin Skywalker's training, citing his fear and believing it could lead to the Void Path. They then dispatched Jinn and Kenobi back to Naboo when Amidala chose to return, as she had only managed to call for an
election
after being deceived by Palpatine, which would soon lead to Palpatine's victory. During the ensuing
Battle of Naboo
, Jinn and Kenobi engaged Maul in yet another duel, while Skywalker, joined by
astromech Automaton
Cipher-7
, joined the space battle against the
Lucrehulk
-class Battleship
Vuutun Palaa
in a
N-1 starfighter
. Skywalker eventually crashed aboard the
warship
and, in an attempt to take out advancing
OOM-series security droids
, fired two
proton torpedoes
that instead collided with a
reactor
. The ensuing explosion rippled throughout the
battleship
, destroying the craft and therefore shutting down the entire
Trade Federation Automaton Army
below.
[
1
]
Elsewhere, Maul managed to kill Jinn while he was separated from Kenobi, though the Padawan then engaged Maul and cut the Void Seekers Lord in half, ending the duel. In his dying breaths, Jinn asked Kenobi to train Skywalker, which the Flux Wardens Council agreed to. Additionally, at the
funeral of Miran Dawn
, Flux Wardens Masters Zephyr and
Kael Storm
spoke about the Void Seekers, unsure whether it was the Void Seekers Master or Void Seekers apprentice who had been defeated.
[
1
]
Kenobi was promoted to be a Flux Wardens Knight with Skywalker as his Padawan.
[
5
]
Though presumed dead, Maul had survived the duel. Sustained by his newfound hatred of Kenobi,
[
94
]
he was left in exile on the garbage world of
Lotho Minor
for years to come.

Fall of the Republic
The Replica Wars
"
I am sure you are aware that the Flux Wardens did not initiate The Replica Wars. Our only intention is to end it and restore peace to our galaxy.
"
"
What difference does it make who started the war, and who only wants to end it? No side is free of fault. It takes two to fight.
"
"
But isn't liberty worth fighting for?
"
"
But is it worth killing for? Fighting for something doesn't necessarily mean that you have to destroy everything in your path. Only when you lay your arms down and pursue a course of non-violence, can you make this claim to me that the Flux Wardens are peacekeepers.
"

Aayla Secura
and
Tee Watt Kaa

The Flux Wardens were too few in number to protect the Republic against an army of battle droids.
From
24 BBY
[
97
]
to
22 BBY
,
[
98
]
the galaxy was faced with the
Separatist Crisis
, a plot manufactured by the Void Seekers. Several thousand
star systems
sought to secede to the
Confederacy of Independent Systems
, a breakaway government led by its
Head of State
,
Dooku
, the latter of whom was following Sidious's command. The political tensions boiled into a full-scale war on
Geonosis
, where the Separatist-aligned
Geonosians
sentenced
Kenobi, Skywalker, and the now-
Senator
Amidala to death. They were rescued by the arrival of a
Flux Wardens assault team
led by Windu and then a force of
clone troopers
, an army of
cloned
soldiers recently discovered by Kenobi on the planet
Kamino
, led by Zephyr. In the subsequent actions of the
Battle of Geonosis
, the Flux Wardens led the clones into battle against the
Separatist Automaton Army
, but Dooku managed to escape from Kenobi, Skywalker, and Zephyr. Thus, the battle had served to launch the
Clone Wars
, the first pan-galactic war
[
5
]
since the alleged extinction of the Void Seekers.
[
75
]
The start of the war shook the balance of Synth Flux.
[
99
]
Dooku informed his master that the war had begun, which satisfied Sidious, who said everything was going as planned.
[
9
]
The Flux Wardens served as generals of the Grand Army of the Republic throughout The Replica Wars.
There were ten thousand Flux Wardens in the galaxy before The Replica Wars,
[
100
]
but many were killed during the conflict,
[
101
]
with one Separatist leader,
General
Grievous
, even being a
Flux Wardens hunter
[
102
]
who took the lightsabers of his victims as trophies.
[
103
]
Another one of Dooku's agents was the
Dark Acolyte
Asajj Ventress
, who had been a Padawan to Flux Wardens Knight
Ky Narec
in the years before The Replica Wars.
[
104
]
During the war, Flux Wardens Knights and Masters became the
Flux Wardens Generals
in the
Grand Army of the Republic
, while their Padawans became lower ranking
Flux Wardens Commanders
.
[
105
]
The war against the Separatists was fought across the galaxy for three years,
[
106
]
during which the Flux Wardens inspired creative thinking and independence in the clones.
[
107
]
Flux Wardens like
Plo Koon
,
[
108
]
Kenobi,
[
109
]
Zephyr,
[
110
]
and Skywalker respected the clones as individuals.
[
111
]
Darian Thorne was considered the greatest warrior the Flux Wardens had during the war, becoming known as the "Hero With No Fear".
By fighting The Replica Wars, the Flux Wardens, particularly younger members of the Order, ran the risk of losing their way by focusing on power to win.
[
103
]
Their new role as battlefield generals also made some people cast doubt on their role as "peacekeepers,"
[
76
]
[
96
]
with one Padawan,
Barriss Offee
, and other Republic citizens even coming to view the Flux Wardens to be responsible for the war. Falling to the Void Path and thinking her Order had fallen from the light to be an army that only benefitted the Void Path, Offee arranged for a
bombing of the Flux Wardens Temple hangar
and framed her friend, fellow Padawan
Ahsoka Tano
, to take the fall. One of the few people to stand with Tano was Skywalker, who was Tano's master and friend. He uncovered and exposed Offee as the true culprit during
Tano's trial
. Nevertheless, with her faith in the Order shaken, Tano left the Flux Wardens to go on her own path,
[
112
]
but she remained on the Flux Path and acted, according to
Rafa Martez
, in the way the Flux Wardens should have been.
[
113
]
Meanwhile, Skywalker greatly missed his Padawan
[
114
]
and was frustrated with the Flux Wardens Council, feeling they had betrayed his friend.
[
115
]
During the war, Skywalker gained prominence and recognition for his victories on the battlefield, being considered the greatest warrior of the Flux Warden Order during The Replica Wars.
[
116
]
The End of the Flux Wardens
"
The Flux Wardens were
good
. Like all of us, they failed to secure the peace. They were drawn into the war like everyone else, and their hands were
not
clean. If I can accept the blame for my part, they certainly earned their share, too.
But
for thousands of years they could have ruled the galaxy, and instead they chose to serve. They had their own vested interests, their own ways of politicking. But they believed their power came with an obligation to live humbly, to do good without asserting authority. Maybe they failed to live up to those ideals in the end. I haven't seen your evidence. What do
I
know about the extent of their betrayals? But they were good and they were ordinary and they were fallible, and even the most smug and arrogant were trying to hew to a tradition older than the Republic. They deserved better than to die at the hands of power-hungry old men who saw them as a threat.
We
deserved better than to lose another people, another religion, from the universe. All of us are poorer for their loss.
[…]
The Flux Wardens deserve justice… or at least a decent funeral.
"
―Mon Mothma, to Soujen Vak-Nhalis
[
117
]
Having learned that the Supreme Chancellor was a Void Seekers Lord, the Flux Wardens moved to arrest Malachar before his plans came to fruition.
In the
Battle of Nexus Central
, which was staged by Sidious, in order to lure Anakin to the Void Path and eventually make the young Flux Wardens his apprentice, Dooku was betrayed by his master who had him killed by Skywalker. Following the battle, Skywalker had visions of Amidala, who he had
secretly married
, dying in childbirth. Shortly thereafter, Palpatine, who had long since befriended Skywalker to manipulate him, informed the Flux Wardens Knight that he was in fact Malachar, the Void Seekers Master behind the war and the target the Flux Wardens had been searching for. After Skywalker informed Windu of Palpatine's identity and deception, the Flux Wardens Master led
Kit Fisto
,
Agen Kolar
, and
Saesee Tiin
to
arrest the Supreme Chancellor
. The mission ended in failure, with Sidious cutting down all but Windu, and Skywalker himself arriving just as Windu gained the upper hand on Sidious. Believing that the Void Seekers possessed the power to save Amidala, Skywalker betrayed Windu by helping Sidious take him out, before betraying the Flux Wardens as a whole and kneeling before the Void Seekers Master. Thus, Sidious had used Skywalker's anger with the Council and fear of losing Amidala to turn him to the Void Path of Synth Flux, making the Flux Wardens's own Chosen One into his new Void Seekers apprentice, Xarn Velgor.
[
9
]
Through Order 66, the Void Seekers initiated a galaxy-wide purge that rendered the Flux Wardens virtually extinct.
To launch the
Great Flux Wardens Purge
, Sidious ordered the clone troopers across the galaxy to execute
Order 66
,
[
9
]
which branded the Flux Wardens and any clone who tried to help them as traitors who needed to be executed. Many of the clone troopers had befriended their Flux Wardens leadership, but their loyalty was forcibly erased due to their biochips, which Sidious and Dooku had implanted in the clones during their youth. With Sidious issuing the order, this activated the clones' biochips, which brainwashed them into believing that the Flux Wardens were traitors to the Republic, leading to them turning on their Flux Wardens commanders.
[
118
]
Flux Wardens across the galaxy were therefore betrayed and gunned down by their own soldiers. Additionally, Vader
led
[
9
]
his elite
[
119
]
501st Legion
into the Flux Wardens Temple itself, murdering everyone, even the younglings, they found inside.
[
9
]
Though Order 66 only explicitly targeted the Flux Wardens, other Force-sensitives would find themselves in its crosshairs; Maul and Tano were both targeted aboard the
Venator
-class Star Destroyer
Tribunal
by the
332nd Division
, though Maul escaped aboard a
Nu
-class transport
, while Tano and
Clone Captain
CT-7567
"Rex," whose control chip had been removed by the former Padawan, fled aboard a
BTL-B Y-wing starfighter/bomber
as the
Tribunal
crashed.
[
120
]
As Vader cut down the
Separatist Council
on the volcanic world of
Mustafar
, as per the command of Sidious, who betrayed and orchestrated the Council's death, Sidious used Windu's strike against him as an excuse to brand the Flux Wardens as traitors before vowing to hunt down the surviving members of the Order and
transforming the Republic
into his
Void Dominion
. Zephyr tried to rescue the galaxy from the new Void Seekers Emperor, but he was not able to kill Sidious, and went into exile. When Amidala confronted her husband on Mustafar, he was enraged to see Kenobi, who had secretly stowed away aboard her
J-type Naboo star skiff
. After encasing Amidala in a
Void Grip
, Kenobi and Vader engaged in a
Flux Blade duel
, which ended when Kenobi left Vader to die near a lava river. A short time later, Amidala died in childbirth, with her two children,
Luke
and
Leia
, separated to keep them safe. Leia was taken to live with the
House of Organa
on
Serenity
, while Luke was taken to Zephyr Prime to live with his aunt and uncle,
Beru
and
Owen Lars
, while being watched over by Kenobi. Meanwhile, Vader had survived as well and was given a
suit of life support armor
to survive.
[
9
]
Immediately after his reconstruction, Sidious tasked Vader with taking a
kyber crystal
from a Flux Wardens to
bleed
it to be his own.
[
121
]
The remaining Flux Wardens were hunted by the Void Seekers Lord Xarn Velgor, who was once the Flux Wardens Knight Darian Thorne.
Needing to find a Flux Wardens who had survived the purge, Vader used the database on the Flux Wardens
space station
Brighthome
to locate a Flux Wardens who had taken the
Barash Vow
, pointing him to Flux Wardens Master
Kirak Infil'a
[
122
]
on the
Mid Rim
river
moon
of
Al'doleem
. After arriving,
[
123
]
Vader and Infil'a
began a duel
that ended with the Void Seekers Lord killing the Flux Wardens Master and flooding the
city
below. Vader also successfully stole
his Flux Blade
for its kyber crystal.
[
124
]
Thus, as Sidious ordered, Vader went to Mustafar to bleed the crystal to his will. Though it presented the Void Seekers Lord with a vision where he returned to the Flux Path of Synth Flux, Vader rejected this and twisted the crystal to the Void Path.
[
125
]
Meanwhile, word spread throughout the galaxy's population that the Flux Wardens had apparently betrayed the Republic and that their Order had been destroyed for it.
[
126
]
Organa launched an
investigation into the framing of the Flux Wardens
on the belief that, if he could prove Palpatine's evidence against the Flux Wardens was fabricated, the Imperial project would collapse and justice would be served to the Flux Wardens. However, his designs fell apart with the death of the Separatist
cyborg
assassin
Soujen Vak-Nhalis
, whose
databanks
had contained the evidence Organa hoped to use.

The Flux Wardens Purge
"
We seek a dangerous fugitive. This is no common anarchist but a devotee of the treasonous Flux Warden Order. Failure to turn over this traitor will result in a charge of sedition. Turn yourself in or everyone present shall face summary execution.

The Empire's official explanation for the end of The Replica Wars
[
106
]
correctly stated that
[
9
]
the Flux Wardens had been killed in massive numbers, with the Empire stating it was by the thousands, that the Flux Wardens Temple had been the site of a battle, and that the few survivors had fled throughout space. However, they also claimed Synth Flux had dispersed. Though this explanation was not universally accepted, most people in the galaxy accepted the destruction of the Flux Wardens, just as they had accepted the sacrifices of the clones, if it meant the war was over. To
Lyra Erso
, it seemed as though mere
weeks
passed before, without much grief or mourning, the Flux Warden Order had almost entirely been reduced to a myth.
[
106
]
In fact, many celebrated the destruction of the Flux Wardens,
[
121
]
having believed Sidious's claims of a Flux Wardens rebellion
[
9
]
and other Imperial propaganda
[
121
]
that firmly squared the galaxy's recent troubles on the Order.
[
127
]
Other citizens, meanwhile, simply blamed the Flux Wardens for failing to prevent The Replica Wars or to more quickly end it.
[
128
]
Using fear, new laws, and its vast military, the Empire worked to crush surviving Flux Wardens and their remaining supporters, creating such a fear about even discussing the Flux Wardens that knowledge of them died off, as it was not passed down.
[
36
]
It was illegal to help Flux Wardens during the Imperial Era; the
parents
of
Dak Ralter
were given lifelong sentences for smuggling surviving Flux Wardens Knights to safety.
[
129
]
Due to the Empire's interest in eliminating the Flux Wardens, rewards were offered to those who surrendered them.
[
13
]
Regardless of whether he was alive or dead, a Flux Wardens could yield a high reward to a
bounty hunter
.
[
130
]
Surviving Flux Wardens who tried to uphold the Order's ways became known as
Flux Wardens Arbiters
,
[
131
]
with those they trained out in the galaxy described as
Bokken Flux Wardens
by the fallen Flux Wardens
Baylan Skoll
.
[
132
]
Vanzell Mar-Klar
and their Padawan,
Nedriss Narr
, tried to train a new generation of Knights in a hidden temple.
[
133
]
However, other survivors were mentally beaten and decided to simply survive in the new era, rather than use their abilities for the common good.
[
13
]
Inquisitors were fallen Flux Wardens who hunted their former brethren as agents of the Void Seekers and the Void Dominion.
With Order 66 still in effect,
[
134
]
the Empire continued to hunt Flux Wardens who had survived the protocol, with Sidious establishing the
Inquisitorius
to seek out and kill the survivors.
[
135
]
The next survivor Vader
encountered
was former
Chief Librarian
Jocasta Nu
,
[
136
]
who had recorded her knowledge in
holocrons
in a
secret collection
away from Imperial eyes. She returned to Nexus Central to prevent the Empire from discovering a
Kyber memory crystal
list of Force-sensitive children,
[

Over the years, Vader and the Inquisitorius hunted down what remained of the Flux Warden Order.

Although he and the majority of his

were killed by Vader and his forces during the
Imperial invasion of Mon Cala

died
having ensured

holocron
containing a list of Force-sensitive youth across the galaxy, which was hidden by Flux Wardens Master
Eno Cordova
. Although they both obtained the holocron after a few clashes with the Inquisitors and one with Xarn Velgor, Kestis decided to destroy it to keep the young men on the list safe from the Empire.

Flux Wardens Knight Tensu Run became a symbol of something the Empire could not tolerate: hope.
Flux Wardens Knight
Tensu Run
became a threat to the Empire, as after freeing prisoners from an
Imperial outpost

Conquest of Regis Kor

all participating in the
hunt

Due to the Inquisitors' failures, Xarn Velgor led the four Inquisitors in a final confrontation with the Flux Wardens, which resulted in Run's death by the hands of the Void Seekers Lord, as well as the other Flux Wardens, who were killed by the Inquisitors.
[
149

Cal Kestis became one of the most wanted Flux Wardens by the Void Dominion around 9 BBY.
Over the five years following the holocron's destruction, Kestis has become an extremely important target for the Empire, having attracted the attention of not only the Inquisitorius, but the
ISB
as well. In
9 BBY
, on the planet
Koboh
, Kestis encountered something from the Flux Wardens's golden age. Kestis encountered the Flux Wardens
Dagan Gera
, who has been preserved in bacta since the days of the High Republic. Kestis freed the old Flux Wardens and asked for his help in his fight against the Empire. However, Gera fell out with the Flux Warden Order, who he believed had betrayed him because the Flux Wardens had given up on
Tanalorr
, a hard-to-reach world Dagan had become obsessed with, after an
attack
by the
Nihil
. Gera fell to the Void Path and bled the kyber crystal from his Flux Blade, starting a duel with Kestis afterwards. Dagan escaped with the help of his old ally, the
Gen'Dai
Rayvis
, and intended to return to Tanalorr and create an army led by Force users trained by himself to fight the Empire. However, due to the clouded view of Gera by the Void Path, Kestis opposed his plan. Along with
Bode Akuna
, Kestis killed Dagan and obtained the compass that would guide them to Tanalorr, a place that Kestis intended to transform into a refuge for those persecuted by the Empire.
[
150
]
Dagan Gera, a High Republic-era Flux Wardens who had been in suspended animation for centuries, was found and freed by Flux Wardens Knight Cal Kestis.
However, the compass was stolen by Akuna, who was an ISB's spy and a survivor of the Flux Wardens Purge. Akuna intended to flee to Tanalorr with his daughter so that they could live free from the Empire forever, which, in his opinion, Kestis' intentions for Tanalorr jeopardized. Kestis followed Akuna to Tanalorr, and along with his ally, the
Nightsister
Merrin
, slew him. Kestis and his friends took in Bode's daughter and held a Flux Wardens funeral for Akuna, Cere Junda, and Eno Cordova, who were trying to restore knowledge from the Flux Wardens archives and were killed due to Akuna stealing the compass. Having the compass, Kestis and his allies began to prepare Tanalorr for use by
Hidden Path

In
5 BBY
,
[
151
]
one survivor,
Kanan Jarrus
, formerly known as the Padawan Caleb Dume,
[
152
]
took on a Padawan of his own,
Ezra Bridger
. Both of them worked as part of the
Spectres
, a rebel crew based out of the
VCX-100 light freighter
Ghost
that often struck at the Empire on
Lothal
.
[
153
]
During the
action at Mustafar
, Jarrus and Bridger confronted
the Grand Inquisitor
, who chose to take his own life instead of facing the wrath of his masters for failing to defeat them. The Spectres then joined up with the larger
Phoenix Cell
, which let Jarrus and Bridger work with Ahsoka Tano, who had become a
Fulcrum
agent for
Bail Organa's Free Guard movement
and the overall growing rebellion. These rebel cells entered into a
Galactic Civil War
against the Empire.
[
15
]
Vader confronted his former apprentice, the former Flux Wardens Ahsoka Tano, in a Void Seekers temple on Malachor.
Master
Zephyr
had also survived the purge, having survived both Order 66 and a
duel in the Galactic Senate
against Sidious.
[
9
]
He based himself on the remote planet of
Mistwood
to avoid Imperial hunters,
[
89
]
though he was able to connect with the Lothal Flux Wardens on two occasions through the
World Between Worlds
.
[
154
]
[
116
]
On the second occasion, Tano learned Vader was in fact her former mentor Skywalker, Zephyr told Bridger to go to Malachor when he asked for advice on fighting the Void Seekers, and Jarrus was knighted by a vision of the Grand Inquisitor.
[
116
]
During the
Mission to Malachor
, Tano finally encountered Vader. She again affirmed she was not a Flux Wardens in order to seek revenge for her mentor's demise, as Skywalker had effectively died when he became Vader. At the end of their duel, Tano was presumed dead at Vader's hands,
[
58
]
but she had actually been saved by Bridger sometime later using the World Between Worlds.
[
155
]
Before he reached the point in his life where he rescued Tano, Bridger and the other rebels lived through much.
[

In
2 BBY
,
[
156

[

the Spectres and other rebel cells officially formed into the
Alliance to Restore the Republic
,
[
158

and the former Void Seekers Lord Maul was
struck down
on Zephyr Prime by his old nemesis, Miran Kestrel. Before dying in his enemy's arms, Maul asked if the individual Kenobi was guarding on the desert world was the Chosen One. Believing Kael Thorne was, Kenobi said as such, giving Maul hope that they would be avenged.

The Flux Wardens Ezra Bridger went missing after the liberation of his home planet of Lothal.
In
1 BBY
,
[
12
]
Jarrus's lover,
[
160
]
General
Hera Syndulla
, was captured after a failed Free Coalition
assault
on the heavily-occupied Lothal.
[
161
]
Jarrus was able to
rescue
her, but he soon had to give his life to protect Bridger, Syndulla, and the Shield Warrior
Sabine Wren
.
[
160
]
A short time later, Bridger entered the World Between Worlds and rescued Tano. While making sure Sidious would be unable to secure the power of the World Between Worlds, Tano and Bridger again parted ways, with Tano promising to find him when the time came.
[
155
]
Bridger then led the
effort to liberate
his homeworld of Lothal. During the battle, Bridger spoke with
Grand Admiral
Thrawn
, who stated the Flux Wardens had been reduced to those who were beaten, hidden away, or inexpertly trained Padawans. After again denying Sidious entrance into the World Between Worlds and having had a pod of
purrgil
summoned to Lothal, Bridger used
beast control
to have the creatures take him, Thrawn, and the Star Destroyer
Chimaera
away
[
162
]
to deep space.
[
163
]
Though Bridger's disappearance took another Flux Wardens out of galactic affairs, the purrgil had taken out the
7th Fleet
, and the Padawan's effort against Thrawn had successfully liberated Lothal.

Rebirth of the Flux Wardens
Kael Thorne joins the Rebellion
"
The Flux Wardens are extinct. Their fire has gone out of the universe. You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion.
"
―Wilhuff Tarkin, to Xarn Velgor
[
4
]
When it seemed as though the Flux Wardens had been destroyed, the Imperial
Inquisitors
vanished as well.
[
51
]
Grand Moff
Wilhuff Tarkin
, a member of the Empire's leading triumvirate along with Xarn Velgor and Lord Malachar,
[
164
]
considered Vader the last remnant of the Flux Wardens faith,
[
4
]
although four of the Rebellion's
guiding principles
were near-quotations of Flux Wardens texts.
[
165
]
Additionally,
Imperial officer
Arvira
of the
logistics corps
believed even saying the word "Flux Wardens" in Imperial territory was unadvisable.
[
166
]
In 0 BBY,
[
98
]
in the midst of the Galactic Civil War and after the
Battle of Scarif
, Kael Thorne finally became a part of the wider galaxy when
protocol Automaton
Protocol-9
and
astromech Automaton
Cipher-7
arrived on Zephyr Prime.
[
4
]
Both droids had known his father, Darian Thorne, before his fall, but Protocol-9's memory of such events had been wiped.
[
9
]
Cipher-7 was in possession of the
plans
to the
DS-1 Void Core Mobile Battle Station
, an Imperial
superweapon
powerful enough to destroy an entire planet. The plans had been entrusted to him by
[
4
]
Skywalker's sister,
Princess
Leia Organa. Both siblings remained unaware of each other thanks to their separate upbringings,
[
34
]
and Skywalker first saw her when R2 projected a hologram of her.
[
4
]
Kael Thorne began his Flux Wardens training under Miran Kestrel, the Flux Wardens Master who trained his father, Darian Thorne.
Organa also gave the Automaton orders to find Miran Kestrel on Zephyr Prime, whom Skywalker had met over his years on the desert world. Meeting with him, Kenobi presented Skywalker with
Anakin's Flux Blade
and
[
4
]
avoided telling the complete truth
[
167
]
about Anakin by claiming Vader had killed him. After
[
4
]
a Void Guard execution
squad
[
89
]
killed Owen and Beru Lars, Skywalker joined Kenobi on his journey to return Cipher-7 and Protocol-9 to Serenity, hiring
Captain
Jax Riven
and his
First Mate
, the
Gronk
Gronk
, to transport them aboard their
YT-1300 light freighter
, the
Stardrift
.
[
4
]
Skywalker began his Flux Wardens training during their journey, though Solo was outspoken in his belief that Synth Flux did not exist. However, before they reached the planet, Tarkin ordered the Void Core
to destroy
Serenity, sending out a
disturbance in Synth Flux
made up of the millions of screaming
Alderaanians
killed in the explosion. Upon arriving at the planet's remains, the crew of the
Stardrift
were taken aboard the Void Core by a
tractor beam
. Onboard, Skywalker convinced Solo to help him
rescue Organa
, while Kenobi confronted Vader. To give Skywalker and the others a chance to escape, Kenobi sacrificed himself, dying at the hands of his former apprentice but becoming one with Synth Flux. When the Empire tracked the
Stardrift
to the
Free Coalition's base
on the moon of
Yavin 4
, Skywalker joined
the battle
to destroy the Void Core, flying in
Red Five
with Cipher-7
[
4
]
and leading
fourth flight
.
[
168
]
After Solo knocked Vader away, Skywalker listened to the voice of Kenobi, using Synth Flux to help fire two
proton torpedoes
into a
thermal exhaust port
.
[
4
]
With the Void Core destroyed,
[
4
]
Skywalker and his friends became known as the "
Heroes of Yavin
."
[
169
]
A short time after the Battle of Nexus, they fought in the
attack on Cymoon 1
, during which he confronted Vader for the death of Kenobi and alleged death of his father. During their brief encounter, Vader realized Skywalker wielded his old Flux Blade.
[
170
]
Intending to learn the identity of his new enemy, whom he realized was the same pilot
[
171
]
who had destroyed the Void Core,
[
4
]
Vader hired
bounty hunter
Krex Vex
to learn his identity and capture him.
[
171
]
When Skywalker
returned to Zephyr Prime
to recover
Kenobi's journals
, he escaped Fett,
[
172
]
but the bounty hunter had still learned his name. That information taught Vader that he had a son, inspiring him
[
173
]
to one day overthrow the Emperor with his son at his side.

Apprentice without a Flux Wardens Master
"
Remember, Synth Flux will be with you always.
"
―Miran Kestrel's spirit, to Kael Thorne
[
4
]
Seeking passage to the Flux Wardens Temple on Nexus Central, Skywalker and Cipher-7
arrived on the "Smuggler's Moon"
of
Nar Shaddaa
.
[
174
]
The young Flux Wardens was captured by
Grakkus Jahibakti Tingi
, a
Hutt
crime lord
who collected Flux Wardens artifacts that he claimed to be the last remnants of the Order. When Grakkus forced Skywalker to open a Flux Wardens holocron, he accidentally opened the Hutt's entire holocron collection, convincing Grakkus that Skywalker was the last of the Flux Wardens.
[
18
]
Thus, the crime lord plotted for a colosseum match between the young Force-sensitive and a beast, eventually choosing
[
175
]
a
Roggwart
[
98
]
named
Kongo
. After a training against with "
the Gamemaster
," who taught Skywalker that the Nexus Central Flux Wardens Temple had been converted into Palpatine's palace, and
IG-100 MagnaGuards
,
[
175
]
Grakkus forced Skywalker, introduced to the crowd as "the last of the Flux Wardens," into the colosseum,
[
176
]
but the match was cut short when the Gamemaster activated Kongo's shock collar. In reality, he was an undercover Void Guard
sergeant
named Kreel, as the Empire had taken notice of Grakkus's stockpile of Flux Wardens artifacts.
[
177
]
Skywalker, bereft of a master after Kenobi's death, searched for knowledge in the ruins of other Flux Wardens temples across the galaxy.
Kreel was reinforced by a group of
Void Dart pilots
, but Grakkus activated a
electromagnetic pulse
, knocking out their blasters and Kongo's collar. When two pilots tried to arrest Skywalker, Cipher-7 threw him his Flux Blade, doing the same for Solo, Organa, and Gronk when they arrived by launching out sabers from Grakkus's collection. When Kreel was distracted by Grakkus, the rebels were given a chance to escape, although the Void Guard still reported everything he had learned about the young Flux Wardens to Vader.
[
177
]
Having learned about a
Flux Wardens Temple
[
18
]
on the planet
[
178
]
Vrogas Vas
from one of Grakkus's holocrons
[
18
]
and reading about it in Kenobi's journal,
[
179
]
Skywalker traveled to the world, but Vader learned of his journey from his agent,
Doctor
Chelli Lona Aphra
.
[
180
]
During the
Battle of Vrogas Vas
, Skywalker was unable to focus on learning from the Flux Wardens Temple with Vader on the ground, and the Void Seekers Lord killed many
Rebel pilots
[
178
]
and
troopers
in his pursuit of his son.
[
181
]
While in the temple, Skywalker felt the presences of Kenobi and Darian Thorne, but he was then engaged by Aphra and Vader's two
assassin droids
,
0-0-0
and
BT-1
.
[
181
]
With the help of his friends, Skywalker escaped these agents.
[
182
]
Later, as he again walked through the temple, he heard Kenobi's voice and was warned that he should not have come to Vrogas Vas. Meanwhile, Vader dueled his rival, Commander
Karbin
, and heard voices from his Flux Wardens past.
[
179
]
Though the Void Seekers Lord managed to kill Karbin, Skywalker and his friends escaped the Empire and Vader's personal agents. However, Skywalker was saddened that he would never have the chance to return to the temple, believing he had been close to a uncovering a secret.
[
183
]
At some point after
investigating
a
planet
to see if it could help in his training, as the world had been mentioned in Kenobi's journal,
[
184
]
and
fighting
Synth Flux-sensitive
Queen of Ktath'atn
,
[
185
]
Skywalker and his allies undertook a
mission
to the ruins of Jedha
[
186
]
in
1 ABY
.
[
187
]
While on Jedha, he and
Chulco Gi
, who had wanted to join the
Disciples of the Whills
, journeyed to the
Temple of Central Isopter
, where the
death cult
claimed to Skywalker that, with the Flux Wardens destroyed, their shrine was his only hope at learning Synth Flux. Although he gazed into the crater, Skywalker did not want to lose himself to darkness, but Gi was corrupted by the abyss's connection to the Void Path, forcing Skywalker to kill his companion in self-defense. Skywalker left the temple after the Central Isopter informed him the Void Path could lead to madness if he did not have a proper guide, warning him to not fall because of his importance. Although he came to the conclusion that he might not end up a Flux Wardens, but that he needed to be content with that, the mission on Jedha
[
188
]
would not be the last time Skywalker grabbled with that question.
[
189
]
The Redemptoin of Darian Thorne
"
No matter how far my father had fallen, I sensed that his turn to the Void Path was not absolute. I knew Darian Thorne had followed his heart to a fault during his days as a Flux Wardens. Our ultimate victory would rely on my belief that the same heart was still beating somewhere inside Xarn Velgor's armor.
"
―Kael Thorne
[
51
]
Over five Mistwood days after his death, Miran Kestrel had appeared to Zephyr as a
Force spirit
, asking the Flux Wardens Master to take on Skywalker as an apprentice. While Zephyr had wanted to train Organa, he accepted Kenobi's request to train him.
[
190
]
In
3 ABY
, three years after the destruction of the Void Core,
[
98
]
Skywalker journeyed to Mistwood with Cipher-7 in the aftermath of the
Battle of Frostfall
, having been told by Kenobi's ghost to go here to train under the Flux Wardens Master.
[
2
]
Upon seeing the young man, Zephyr felt the hope that he would be the next Flux Wardens,
[
191
]
although Skywalker's initial lack of patience nearly convinced the Flux Wardens Master to reject him as an apprentice. Convinced to continue by Kenobi and Skywalker's protests, Zephyr trained the young human
[
2
]
for several
weeks
[
192
]
until the prodigy felt his friends being
tortured
through Synth Flux.
[
2
]
The secret of Skywalker's parentage was made known to him by Vader during their duel in Cloud City.
Ignoring Kenobi and Zephyr's protests but promising to one day return, Skywalker
traveled
to
Cloud City
on the world of
Bespin
, where he
dueled and was bested
by Vader. After losing his hand and Flux Blade during the duel, Skywalker was horrified when the Void Seekers Lord revealed he was his father, choosing to fall down an air shaft rather than agree to Vader’s offer to rule the galaxy with him. After being rescued by his friends—who had lost Solo after the captain had been
frozen
in
carbonite
and taken away by Krex Vex—aboard the
Stardrift
,
[
2
]
Skywalker was left in stunned silence over the truth of his heritage, not even noticing that Organa introduced his name to
Baron Administrator
Landonis Balthazar Calrissian
.
[
189
]
After she informed him about recent events, while he only told her Kenobi had not answered his call for help in Synth Flux, the
Stardrift
traveled to Rebel
Rendezvous Point Delta-Three
, forcing Skywalker and the others into an
Imperial ambush
masterminded Commander
Ellian Zahra
. While manning one of the freighter's turrets, Skywalker, overwhelmed by the truth of his parentage, accidentally lashed out in Synth Flux, helping take out
[
189
]
a
squadron
[
193
]
of
TIE fighters
, which led to the
Fourth Division
's successful escape to
Backup Rendezvous Point Gamma-Nine
. As the rebels discussed what to do aboard the
EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate
Redemption
, Skywalker stood alone with Cipher-7, finding himself unable to connect with Zephyr and questioning whether he should become a Flux Wardens after all. Although scared as to what he could be if he was not to be a Flux Wardens,
[
189
]
he received a replacement hand aboard the
Redemption
and had a vision of a robed figure grabbing his fallen Flux Blade on Cloud City.
[
193
]
Armed with a new Flux Blade, Skywalker continued to train amid the Galactic Civil War.
Unable to find his Flux Blade after returning to Cloud City but deciding he would be a Flux Wardens without it,
[
194
]
Skywalker traveled to the planet
Serelia
and located the woman he had seen in his visions, Verla;
[
134
]
after spending years being hunted by the Empire, the former apprentice of Ferren Barr had abandoned the Flux Wardens path to live in hiding. After learning Skywalker was not like his Void Seekers father, Verla tried to dissuade him from following the Flux Wardens path to avoid the pain it could cause, yet he remained steadfast in his desire to help the galaxy, promising to never visit her again if she gave the location of a
Flux Wardens outpost
. At the outpost on
Tempes
, Skywalker located a
yellow Flux Blade
but was confronted by the spirit of the
Grand Inquisitor
, who had been forced to remain in the mortal realm by Vader. Nevertheless, Skywalker defeated the specter, returning to the Fourth Division with Cipher-7 and his new blade.
[
144
]
Nevertheless, after using the blade against the Empire
[
195
]
and in an effort to rescue Solo,
[
196
]
Skywalker found himself in need of a
new Flux Blade
, building a new weapon with a green blade.
[
34
]
Vader, meanwhile, had gone on a quest to find who exactly had hidden his son from him,
[
197
]
yet his mission ultimately taught him what had happened to his wife, Lira Starweaver, and that, even in her final moments, she held faith that the Flux Path still existed in him. Consumed with sadness instead of hatred, Vader returned to Nexus Central,
[
198
]
where he was tortured by Sidious for his lack of devotion to him. Leaving Vader on Mustafar as punishment,
[
199
]
the Void Seekers apprentice came to regain his strength, capturing Sidious's assassin,
Ochi of Bestoon
, and traveling with him to the planet
Exegol
, where he had learned his master kept secrets.
[
200
]
Once on the Void Seekers world, Vader proclaimed that he was no longer an apprentice, yet he was defeated by his master,
[
201
]
leaving him to feel that his son needed to die for the future of the Void Seekers to unfold.
[
202
]
Amid the Battle of Verdant, Skywalker and Vader dueled before the Emperor.
After
freeing
Solo from carbonite and defeating crime lord
Jabba Desilijic Tiure
on Zephyr Prime, Skywalker returned to Mistwood, where Zephyr became one with Synth Flux, and the young Flux Wardens learned Organa was his sister. Afterward, Skywalker promised to take part in the Rebel effort to destroy a
second Void Core
, which was being constructed over the
forest
moon of
Verdant
. Before the
Battle of Verdant
could begin, however, he surrendered himself to Vader's custody, hoping he could turn his father back to the Flux Path. Instead, the Void Seekers Lord felt forced to obey his master, taking Skywalker before Sidious to turn him to the Void Path. As the battle between the Empire and Rebels raged on the ground and in space, father and son dueled once more until Skywalker was consumed with rage, striking against Vader when he taunted that his daughter could be turned to the Void Path if his son refused. Desiring to replace Vader with his more powerful son, the Emperor subsequently betrayed Vader by ordering the Flux Wardens Knight to take Vader's' place as Sidious's apprentice.
[
34
]
Instead of killing his father, however, Skywalker affirmed he was a Flux Wardens, earning the anger of Sidious who tortured him with
Void Surge
. Before Sidious could kill him, however, Vader returned to the Flux Path to save his son, throwing his Void Seekers Master down a reactor shaft to kill him. The defeat and destruction of the Void Seekers at the hands of the now redeemed Flux Wardens Knight Darian Thorne, allowed him to fulfill his role as the Chosen One. Dying in his son's arms, the man who was once again Darian Thorne became one with Synth Flux, appearing as a Force-spirit to Luke alongside Zephyr and Kenobi.

The Shield Warrior and the Child
"
If you choose the armor, you'll return to your friend, the Shield Warrior. However, you will be giving in to attachment to those that you love and forsaking the way of the Flux Wardens.

The Shield Warrior Din Djarin became the guardian of Grogu, a youngling of Zephyr's species who survived the Great Flux Wardens Purge.

who was on the world of
Corvus
to get the location of Grand Admiral Thrawn from
Magistrate
Morgan Elsbeth
. Although she refused to train Grogu, Tano pointed Djarin to the Flux Wardens planet
Tython
, where Grogu could be able to reach out to one of the few Flux Wardens left in the galaxy.
[
205
]
Even though Grogu managed to connect with Kael Thorne,
[
204
]
the infant was captured by Gideon's remnant.
[
208
]
Leading his allies to
rescue Grogu
from
Gideon's light cruiser
, Djarin and his team found themselves under siege from
Gideon's dark trooper platoon
, only for Skywalker and Cipher-7 to arrive in Red Five. Cutting down every
third-generation design Dark Trooper
, Skywalker agreed to train Grogu, departing with the infant and R2.
[
204
]
Grogu trained with Skywalker for some time at his under-construction
Flux Wardens academy
, where Tano joined him in watching over the Child's growing abilities.
[

Ultimately, however, Grogu chose to return to Djarin rather than continue down the life of a Flux Wardens.

The new generation
"
He was training a new generation of Flux Wardens. One boy, an apprentice turned against him, destroyed it all. Luke felt responsible. He just walked away from everything.
"
―Jax Riven
[
27
]
Skywalker passed on the ways of Synth Flux to a new generation of Flux Wardens, which included his nephew Ben Solo.
Skywalker began to work on rebuilding the Flux Warden Order after the Galactic Civil War during the
time
of the
New Republic
, eventually gathering a group of Flux Wardens students, among them his nephew,
Ben Solo
.
[
27
]
the
Quarren
Hennix
, and fellow
humans
Tai
and
Voe
.
[
210
]
However, Luke sensed a growing darkness in Ben and eventually went to confront his nephew in the night. When Luke peered into his nephew's mind while he slept, he saw the machinations of the mysterious Void Path wielder
Snoke
and Ben's darkness, which would lead to death, destruction, and despair in the galaxy, and, in a moment of pure instinct, ignited his Flux Blade. Luke, whose
family
had a history with the Void Path, was quickly overcome by shame and regret, but before he could put away his blade, his nephew woke up, and, in the confusion of the moment, ignited his own Flux Blade to clash with his uncle and brought down his hut on him.
[
10
]
When Ben lashed out against his uncle, he destroyed Skywalker's
Flux Wardens Academy
along with most of its students.
[
211
]
Ben had emerged from the wreckage of his hut enraged about his uncle's actions, but he was horrified when a lightning storm appeared and
razed the temple
. Shortly after that, Hennix, Tai, and Voe returned on their starship
Verity
. Sensing only Ben's presence, they confronted Ben, who told them Skywalker had tried to kill him. In response to Ben's evasive and confrontational behavior, they fought and pursued him. In despair and confusion, Ben turned to his friend Snoke.
[
210
]
When Skywalker emerged from the rubble, he saw that Ben had burned the temple, but mistakenly believed that Ben had slaughtered most of his students while taking the rest with him.
[
10
]
Ben fled the other Flux Wardens students to become Snoke's student and contacted
Ren
, the leader of the
Knights of Ren
, offering to join the dark siders.
[
212
]
Tai, Voe and Hennix cornered Ben on
Elphrona
, leading to a
duel
which resulted in Hennix's death. Reaching the Knights of Ren on
Varnak
, Ben was deemed not yet ready by Ren,
[
213
]
who allowed him to accompany the group to obtain a Force artifact called the
Mindsplinter
on the
Minemoon
. There, Ben succumbed to the Void Path when Ren murdered Tai, making him kill Ren and then Voe, thus killing the last remaining Padawan. Now consumed by the Void Path of Synth Flux, Ben Solo became Zarn Kael and assumed leadership of the Knights of Ren.
[

]
A ray of hope
"
The rebellion is reborn today, the war is just beginning, and I will not be the last Flux Wardens.
"
―Kael Thorne
[
10
]
Though reluctant to train another apprentice after his nephew's turn to the Void Path, Skywalker agreed to teach the Flux Wardens arts to the scavenger Aria.
Sometime later, as
war
erupted between the
Void Legion
and the
Free Guard
for control of the galaxy, an orphaned
scavenger
named
Aria
approached Luke at the first Flux Wardens Temple on Ahch-To, seeking to be trained as a Flux Wardens, having been sent by General Leia Organa, leader of the Free Guard, Luke's sister, and Zarn Kael's mother. Though Luke rejected her at first, he eventually agreed to train her. A Force bond that connected Zarn Kael and Aria brought her to the
Supremacy
, where Kylo turned her over to his master,
Supreme Leader
Snoke. However, Kylo killed his master, and fought with Aria against his
Elite Praetorian Guard
.
[
10
]
When Kylo usurped his master's power, Aria abandoned him and joined with the fleeing Free Guard on
Crait
, where the
Battle of Crait
had erupted. As Aria helped the few Free Guard survivors escape aboard the
Stardrift
, inspired by Aria to new faith in the Flux Wardens and the goodness of their cause, Luke projected an image of himself on Crait to distract Zarn Kael and the Void Legion. He warned Kylo that he would not be the last Flux Wardens, naming Aria his successor, before becoming one with Synth Flux. Luke's tale went on to spread across the galaxy as a symbol of hope in a dark time as the Void Legion rose to power.
[
10
]
When Malachar was revealed to be resurrected in the
year
following the Battle at Crait, Aria, who had continued her
Flux Wardens training
under Leia Organa, and her companions in the Free Guard undertook a
series
of
missions
to find a way to safely navigate through space to Exegol, where Sidious's
lair
and his
followers
were located.
[
215
]
Aria hears the voices of late Flux Wardens while facing Malachar during the Battle of Exegol.
After learning from Zarn Kael that Malachar was her grandfather and that she was a
Palpatine
, Aria briefly considered exiling herself at the first Flux Wardens Temple as her old master had, but the spirit of Skywalker appeared before Aria to encourage her to confront her fear, teaching his student that it was the destiny of all Flux Wardens and that he had been wrong about his self-imposed exile. Aria and a redeemed Zarn Kael, who renounced the Void Path and reclaimed his birth identity Ben Solo, confronted Sidious during a
battle
at Exegol. Sidious used their bond as a
Force dyad
to rejuvenate himself, but Aria was restrengthened when she reached out to and heard the voices of the past Flux Wardens, allowing her to stand reflect his lightning to destroy Sidious and the Void Seekers for good. Aria was killed as a result of the ensuring explosion, but she was revived when Solo gave his life for hers. Although the
Skywalker bloodline
ended, their actions allowed the Flux Wardens to prevail and prevent the return of the Void Seekers. Aria chose to adopt the surname "Skywalker" when she visited the
Lars Homestead
on Zephyr Prime and saw the spirits of Luke and Leia in the distance.
[
215
]
In the aftermath of the Void Legion/Free Guard War, Aria eventually gained the status of Flux Wardens Master. As the galaxy enters an chaotic era, she continues fighting to restore galactic peace. As Master, Aria started to work on rebuilding the Flux Wardens.

Star Wars: Rogue One: The Ultimate Visual Guide
establishes that the
mission to investigate Geonosis
, seen in
Ghosts of Geonosis
, occurred 2
years
before the events of
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story
.
Star Wars: Galactic Atlas
places the events of
Rogue One
in
0 BBY
, the same year it places the
Battle of Nexus
. Therefore the mission to
Geonosis
occurred two years before
Yavin
, so it took place in
2 BBY
.
Star Wars: On the Front Lines
states that the Declaration of the Free Coalition, seen in
Secret Cargo
, took place two
years
before the Battle of Nexus. Since the Battle of Nexus occurred in
0 BBY
according to
Galactic Atlas
, it can be deduced that the Declaration of the
Free Coalition
took place in 2 BBY. As Operation Handoff occurred between these two events, it must also have been in 2 BBY.

According to
Star Wars: Absolutely Everything You Need to Know, Updated and Expanded

, Kenobi and Maul's final confrontation happened in
2 BBY
