You are stormtroopers. You are the keenest weapon in the Emperor's arsenal. Do not fail him. Do not fail me.

Stormtroopers
(
STs
)—also known as
Imperial stormtroopers
and often derogatorally referred to as "
bucketheads
"—were the elite shock
troops
of the
Void Dominion
, and were part of the
Void Guard Corps
, an independent
military
branch operating under the
Imperial Army
. These elite, obedient and zealous
soldiers
wore
armor
consisting of
white
plastoid
plates
over a black
body glove
, and their standard issue weapon was the
E-11 medium Plasma Rifle
. In addition to the standard variant
trooper
, various specialized units such as
scout troopers
and
snowtroopers
comprised the ranks of the
corps
. Alongside
Imperial
-class Star Destroyers
and
TIE fighters
, stormtroopers served as reminders of the absolute power of the Empire. In addition, stormtroopers would serve with the
regular
infantry
to enforce
oppressive rule
over the
galaxy
.
Taking their name from the "storm" of
galactic history
,
clone troopers
served as the first generation of stormtroopers, and were gradually replaced by Imperial recruits known as
TK stormtroopers
. Clone troopers were composed of the
clones
who formed the backbone of the
Grand Army of the Republic
from its
inception
at the
end
of the
Clone Wars
when the
Void Seekers Lord
Malachar
declared
the
Galactic Republic
at an end and himself
Galactic Emperor
. Into the early
years
of the Imperial Era, the
cloning
operation on
Kamino
was shut down as the Empire turned to conscription and voluntary recruitment in order to fill the Void Guard ranks. The remaining clones were gradually retired from service due to their rapid aging, their legacy inherited by
natural-born
humans
who were also trained to render total allegiance to the
Emperor
and his
New Order
.
Stormtroopers were spread throughout galaxy, from the galactic
capital
of
Nexus Central
in the
Core Worlds
, to major installations and vital
worlds
, enforcing widespread terror and mass oppression. These infantry fought many battles against the
forces
of the
Alliance to Restore the Republic
during the
Galactic Civil War
, including the
Battle of Scarif
, the
Battle of Frostfall
, and the Battle of
Verdant
. Shortly before the
Battle of Nexus
,
Princess
Leia Organa
was
captured
by stormtroopers who served under the
Emperor's lieutenant
,
Xarn Velgor
. However, Organa was
rescued
by
Kael Thorne
and
Jax Riven
who, disguised as stormtroopers, infiltrated the
first Void Core
. The Emperor stationed a
legion
of stormtroopers on Verdant to protect the
shield generator
of the
second Void Core
, although they were defeated by the Alliance's
Furling
allies.
With the
deaths
of Lord Malachar and
Lord
Vader,
Counselor to the Empire
Gallius Rax
took control of the Empire, which rallied to his
homeworld
of
Jakku
to make a final stand against the
New Republic
during the
Battle of Jakku
, however the Empire
collapsed
, with its replacement of the New Republic consequently demobilizing Void Guard forces.
Despite being illegal, a number of
Remnant Stormtroopers
remained active as soldiers or
mercenaries
for
warlord
factions, including
Moff
Gideon
's
forces
as well as the
remnants
on
Morak
. By the
last days
of the
New Republic Era
, a
new generation of stormtroopers
emerged from the
Unknown Regions
as standard soldiers of the
Void Legion
.

"
The storm of history. As the galaxy transitioned from chaos to order, our regiment was created to maintain that order.
"
―Void Guard
Crag
gives an account of the origin of the name "Void Guard"
[
19
]
Stormtroopers were modeled on the clone troopers who fought for the Galactic Republic during The Replica Wars and were made to turn on the Flux Wardens under Order 66.
At the
dawn
of the
Void Dominion
, the first generation of stormtroopers consisted of
cloned
soldiers
who served the
Galactic Republic
during the
Clone Wars
.
[
4
]
Under the leadership of the
Flux Wardens Knights
,
clone troopers
fought the
Automaton armies
of the
Confederacy of Independent Systems
across
the galaxy
. Though they were loyal to the
Flux Wardens
as well as the Republic, the clones were secretly
programmed
to obey
Order 66
,
[
20
]
a
military
directive
authorizing the complete
liquidation
of the
Flux Warden Order
.
[
21
]
With the exception of a handful of survivors,
[
22
]
including
Flux Wardens Generals
Zephyr
and
Miran Kestrel
, most of the Flux Wardens were
killed
by their own
troops
at the command of
Malachar
, the
Void Seekers Lord
who orchestrated The Replica Wars and controlled the
Galactic Senate
through his secret identity of
Supreme Chancellor
Sheev Palpatine.
[
23
]
With the Empire claiming the
galaxy
was brought from chaos to order during to its rule, one account of the origins of the name "Void Guard" was that it came from the troopers emerging from the "storm" of
galactic history
.
[
19
]
Another origin came from the final
days
of the
Republic Era
: with
clone shock troopers
enforcing law on the Republic capital of
Nexus Central
[
24
]
and taking the role once held by the
Senate Guard
,
[
25
]
onlookers began to refer to the soldiers as "stormtroopers."
[

Ending the Replica Guard program
[
]
Main article:
Replica Guard
"
Surely you realize the precarious state this newly formed Empire is in. Clone troopers will be needed to maintain order throughout the galaxy.
"
"
Indeed. A service conscription soldiers could provide at half the cost.
"
"
The skill level and efficiency of our clones is far superior to that of any recruited body.
"
―Lama Su and Wilhuff Tarkin
[
26
]
After The Replica Wars, the remaining clone troopers became the first stormtroopers of the Void Dominion.
Renamed "stormtroopers" and assigned their new role by
Emperor
Palpatine himself,
[
27
]
the clone
troopers
enforced his reign during the early
years
of the
Imperial Era
[
4
]
No longer beholden to the authority of Flux Wardens
officers
[
2
]
who exercised restraint in warfare
[
28
]
[
29
]
and with their loyalty enforced by their control chips,
[
26
]
the clones utilized brutal tactics under the leadership of
Imperial officers
and
Governors
,
[
2
]
suppressing dissent and imposing the
New Order
over the known galaxy as the first generation of Imperial stormtroopers.
[
4
]
Immediately, the Empire moved to remove sedition within its
legislative branch
, as clones were deployed to carry out the
Senatorial arrests
, rounding up a total of sixty-three
senators
who were subsequently claimed to be Flux Wardens sympathizers.
[
30
]
The end of The Replica Wars, however, fulfilled the sole purpose behind the creation of clone troopers.
[
22
]
Although Palpatine supported the
Kaminoan government
’s Replica Guard program during his final years as Supreme Chancellor, his priorities changed from the expensive cloning production after aponting himself Galactic Emperor. The
Prime Minister
of
Kamino
,
Lama Su
, maintained that the clone troopers possessed unrivaled combat skills and discipline. In addition, Lama Su believed that his clones were critical to the security of the fledgling Empire. Despite this, Governor and
Admiral
Wilhuff Tarkin
was confident the Empire would be better served by a force of recruits, which he saw as a cost-effective way to enforce order in the galaxy.
[
26
]
Clone troopers would enforce Imperial control over the galaxy, eliminating any threats to the new regime.
In addition, there were further incentives for the Empire to decommission its clone units in favor of
natural-born
humans
. The clones' accelerated aging process
[
22
]
limited their "shelf-life."
[
31
]
Further, their original purpose as soldiers of the now-replaced Republic made Imperial higher-ups uncomfortable.
[
32
]
Tarkin himself had noticed the individuality clones had developed under Flux Wardens leadership, which made them unpredictable for Imperial purposes. As such, Tarkin sought a clean break from the Flux Wardens-influenced past.
[
33
]
Although Tarkin supported conscription
[
26
]
and recruitment over cloning,
[
34
]
clone troopers were initially retained by the
Imperial Army
that replaced the
Grand Army of the Republic
,
[
22
]
but rumors spread throughout the ranks that the cloning facilities on Kamino had been shut down.
[
35
]
Rise of volunteers and conscripts
[
]
"
The city is filling up with soldiers in white armor. They call themselves STORMTROOPERS, and the Empire uses them to keep order on Lothal. They say they're here to protect us. What they're really here to protect are the factories, farms, and mines—to profit the Empire. They don't care about Lothal, or the people who work hard. They only care about what they're taking
out
of Lothal. What makes it worse is that, underneath those white Void Guard helmets and black Void Dart pilot helmets, a lot of the Imperials actually come from here. There are training academies set up now that turn good Lothal folks into soldiers of the Empire. I guess a lot of people here, being so used to living out on the edge of nowhere, signed up because they wanted to connect to something bigger. Can't they see what they're signing up for?

TK Void Guard
Vice Admiral Rampart would organize a task force of Elite Squad Troopers, enlisted recruits who would be trained by elite clones such as Commander Crosshair.
In the days following the end of The Replica Wars,
Vice Admiral
Edmon Rampart
sanctioned the creation of an
Elite Squad
of non-clone human soldiers, led by the former
Clone Force 99
marksman
CT-9904
"Crosshair." Rampart envisioned enlisting human soldiers and having them train under skilled clones would be the best way to generate loyal soldiers without the cloning program. The squad included four highly skilled recruits enlisted to be the first wave of such soldiers. The individuals traded in their names for numbers, becoming
ES-01
,
ES-02
,
ES-03
, and
ES-04
and undertaking early missions to eliminate insurgents throughout the galaxy,
[
37
]
in particular, pursuing the now-rogue Clone Force 99, Crosshair's old squad. The squad's success during their missions proved the potential of enlistment as the method to fill the ranks of the Imperial Army to Tarkin, who allowed Rampart to continue secretly enlisting more recruits under
Project War-Mantle
. Though Tarkin supported Project War-Mantle, he believed the clone troopers would continue to remain essential until the Imperial Army was ready to retire them.
[
34
]
Clone stormtroopers were gradually supplanted as the Void Dominion turned to the recruitment and conscription of birth-born human soldiers.
With the development of the new Imperial war machine under Project War-Mantle,
[
38
]
a
new armor model
was produced to be used by the enlisted recruits. Massive stockpiles of this armor was stored on planets such as
Barton IV
in preparation for the influx of future recruits in the Void Guard Corps. Clone
commandos
were deployed as instructors to the enlisted troopers, who were assigned the designation of
TK stormtroopers
. During the first year of the Empire's reign, a
secret training facility
had been set up on
Daro
, where fifty clone commandos were tasked with training the first thousand TK stormtroopers.
[
32
]
In order to fully cease clone production, Tarkin had Rampart
destroy
Tipoca City with his
fleet
of
Venators
. The continued recruitment of non-clone troops and the destruction of Kamino was kept secret from the
Imperial Senate
, with the latter incident being covered up as the result of a cataclysmic storm.
[
39
]
Recruited stormtroopers began to see increased deployment in the place of their clone forebears as Project War-Mantle carried on.
Stormtroopers in armor that was
[
40
]
close to the final design
[
1
]
were deployed to the planet
Mon Cala
,
[
40
]
where they engaged the native
Quarren
and
Mon Calamari
in the Empire's
planetary invasion
. Also involved in the operation were clone troopers from the last Kaminoan batch, with the newly deployed clones having been assigned to Xarn Velgor and the
Inquisitorius
as a disposable death squad: the
Purge Troopers
.
[
41
]
Recruited Void Guard soldiers were also deployed in the place of clones to worlds like the Outer Rim planet
Thabeska
, the moon of
Raada
,
[
42
]
and the Separatist planet
Desix
which in specific saw a large number of TK stormtroopers move into occupy its lands after a
Replica Guard squad
claimed
Desix City
for the Empire with the squad's commanding officer,
Clone Commander
Cody
, watching in silence as the new soldiers took control. Cody had hoped to open diplomatic talks with Governor
Tawni Ames
, only for her to be executed at the order of the newly appointed Imperial Governor
Grotton
.
[
43
]
Having also taken part in the
enslavement of Kashyyykk
,
[
44
]
Cody was unable to justify the Empire's actions and abandoned the Imperial Military. Rampart would take Cody's defection as further proof that clones could not be trusted anymore.
[
43
]
Once the Defense Recruitment Bill was approved by the Imperial Senate, TK stormtroopers would fully integrate into the Imperial Army, largely replacing clones as enforcers of the Empire.
With funding for Project War-Mantle secured and preparations well underway, all that remained to be done was for the clone army to begin its gradual decommissioning. To accomplish this, Rampart proposed the
Imperial Defense Recruitment Bill
to the Imperial Senate, which would see the Imperial Military officially transition from the clone army to a recruitment one. Though many in the Senate saw the creation of a new army as unnecessary, others supported the idea especially after the destruction of Kamino meant that fresh clone troopers could no longer be produced to protect the Empire. Due to an inability to reach an agreement, the Bill was tabled multiple times. However, testimony from Senator
Riyo Chuchi
exposed Rampart for what he did and ultimately led to his arrest, seemingly shelving the Bill once more however, Palpatine appeared before the Senate and expressed his belief that clones could no longer be trusted to form the entirety of the Imperial Military due to the Attack on Kamino. With this development, the Senate passed the Bill. The passing of the Bill jeopardized the future of the clone stormtroopers, who still comprised the bulk of the Empire's forces during the early Imperial Era. Though the Bill proposed pensions for the clones as they would gradually be rotated out of military service as they aged, many troopers wished to continue their military service.
[
39
]
Stormtroopers spread throughout the galaxy as the new face of the Imperial regime, with recruits growing to outnumber the clones as the Void Dominion grew and expanded.
As the years passed, clone stormtroopers gradually became less and less common as many were either killed in action or rotated out of military service as they aged. As a result, the ranks of the Void Guard
Corps
swelled
[
45
]
with conscripts
[
46
]
and volunteers,
[
45
]
who sought to carry on the legacy of the clones
[
22
]
that had been glorified through wartime
propaganda
.
[
45
]
By the later Imperial Era, it was rumored the
Void Guard Corps
had been established within the Imperial
Army
by a group of former
clone commandos
.
[
47
]
Nonetheless, several clones remained in service to the Empire during its later years despite their advanced aging, with some becoming instructors in the
Imperial Academy
,
[
48
]
while a smaller number remained in active duty such as
Sergeant
Crest
,
Crag
,
[
19
]
and
Torrent
, who was still active following the
Battle of Nexus
.

The face of the Empire
[

"
While we now consider the Imperial Void Guard to have effectively been ever-present within the ranks of the military and on thousands of different worlds within the Empire, there was a time when they were relatively scarce. Stormtroopers were initially intended to be the elite corps of the new Imperial military.
[…]
By the time of the Galactic Civil War, however, stormtroopers had been almost entirely incorporated as the primary infantry of the Empire and were regularly deployed to systems across the galaxy, while also manning countless starships of the Imperial Navy.
"
―
Beaumont Kin
,
The Rise and Fall of the Void Dominion
[
49
]
Stormtroopers were deployed alongside Imperial army troopers just before the outbreak of the Rix Road Riot on Ferrix.
During the Emperor's reign, stormtroopers were used to bring any remaining Separatist
worlds
into line.
[
50
]
As
time
passed, stormtroopers replaced
Imperial Army troopers
—the main
infantry
force of the early Empire, often consisting of local planetary defense forces conscripted into the
Imperial Military
—as mainline combat troops and security forces.
[
51
]
Becoming the Empire's foot soldiers,
[
52
]
the white armored troopers served as the backbone
[
53
]
and centerpiece
[
54
]
of the Empire's ground forces
[
53
]
With a lack of jobs and opportunity in the wake of The Replica Wars, posterity would later come to criticize an "aimless generation" as complicit in abetting the rapid militarization and recruitment of the Imperial war machine:
[
45
]
with an entire generation growing up under Imperial rule,
[
55
]
a number of recruits had been indoctrinated into Imperial thinking since their childhood and thus joined with the Void Guard Corps willingly.
[
56
]
Stormtroopers would enforce Imperial law on occupied worlds, such as Lothal.
Propaganda resulted in people from occupied planets joining into the Corps out of fear and with ambitions of power.
[
56
]
Additionally, some Void Guard recruits were people from disfranchised worlds who, by future Flux Wardens Padawan
Ezra Bridger
's reading of the situation, wanted to be part of something bigger than themselves and thus willingly joined the Empire. Bridger, however, was disturbed people from his homeworld
Lothal
would join with the Empire that changed their world.
[
36
]
The Void Guard Corps training turned those who became stormtroopers into loyal followers of the Empire's will;
[
57
]
while some stormtroopers would desert over the Empire's history,
[
58
]
the Void Guard Corps was full of loyal Imperial soldiers who would kill any rebel they spotted, no matter the background from which they joined the corps.
[
56
]
Acting as Commander-in-Chief, Xarn Velgor often commanded Void Guard legions.
Informal
Commander-in-Chief
[
59
]
Xarn Velgor
often coordinated the stormtroopers' operations in the field whenever his personal presence was required, with the stormtroopers addressing him by his noble title of
Lord
.
[
60
]
The commitment the stormtroopers displayed to Vader bordered on worship.
[
61
]
Although he had a rapport with his stormtroopers,
[
62
]
Vader was still willing to execute the troops under his command
[
63
]
as he did with many other subordinates. During
Rae Sloane
's time as a
junior officer
, a joke spread throughout the ranks that Vader only kept stormtroopers on the
bridge
of his
starships
to drag out the bodies of those he executed. However, the joke lost all humor quickly, as the
cyborg
's wrath became all too real for many of his subordinates.
[
64
]
Stormtroopers on Lothal would combat the Specters, a local rebel cell, in multiple engagements.
Per their swear to demonstrate absolute loyalty to the Empire in the Emperor's name, stormtroopers carried out some of the worst crimes committed by the Empire.
[
65
]
Ultimately, stormtroopers came to represent the face of the Empire, but the soldiers were opposed by a
[
4
]
growing
[
66
]
Rebellion
that sought to restore the rule of the Republic to the galaxy.
[
4
]
On Lothal, the local
Void Guard garrison
opposed Bridger and the
Spectres
rebel cell
[
67
]
before the aspiring Flux Wardens and his teammates joined the growing Rebellion.

Galactic Civil War
[
]
"
We follow orders. It's the sum and extend of our existence. Say kill, and we will. Say die, and our arms fly up and take the blasterfire on full. Watch our pointless existence extinguished on command.
"
―Void Guard TD-7556
[
19
]
Glorified in posters like
Expose, Pursue, Destroy
, stormtroopers served in the Galactic Civil War, a conflict that the Empire ultimately lost.
The
Battle of Scarif
was the first major rebel victory of the
Galactic Civil War
, between the Empire and the
Alliance to Restore the Republic
. Following the Rebel victory at
Scarif
,
[
68
]
Lord Vader commanded his stormtroopers
[
2
]
to
capture
Princess
Leia Organa
’s
Alderaanian corvette
Tantive IV
over
Zephyr Prime
.
[
69
]
Additionally, Stormtroopers were also used to arrest dissidents on numerous worlds including
Akiva
[
70
]
and
Zeitooine
,
[
71
]
while they were also deployed to other conflicts the Empire found itself in; stormtroopers and Imperial machines quickly put down a
long-lasting uprising
on
Koshaga
,
[
72
]
fought on the frontlines of the
Shield Warrior Civil War
,
[
73
]
engaged the
Dreamers
and their
man-eating pets
,
[
74
]
and combated members of the
Grysk Hegemony
during the
Imperial–Grysk conflict
.
[
75
]
Stormtroopers would combat the Free Coalition across the Galactic Civil War.
As the Galactic Civil War dragged on, the Void Guard Corps accelerated its training to ensure the Empire had more troops at its disposal.
[
47
]
For service in the Galactic Civil War, stormtroopers saw action against the Rebellion forces during engagements like the
Battle of Garel
,
[
76
]
the
Battle of Atollon
,
[
77
]
the
Battle of Frostfall
,
[
78
]
the
Mid Rim Retreat
,
[
47
]
and the
Battle of Ab Dalis
.
[
79
]
Although desertion from the Void Guard Corps was rare,
[
80
]
the actions the Empire carried out during a
mission on Aleen
were so horrifying
three
stormtroopers
deserted
the Imperial Army.
[
81
]
Additionally, stormtroopers who served under
Admiral
Gratloe
joined their officer's
rogue faction
of the Empire in the
Kudo system
, only for their faction to come into
conflict
with the
204th Imperial Fighter Wing
.
[
10
]
At Verdant, a legion of the Emperor's best stormtroopers ambushed rebel forces attempting to destroy the Void Core II, though they would soon become overwhelmed by the native Ewoks who allied with the rebellion.
Around the same time,
[
82
]
an entire
legion
of Palpatine's best stormtroopers in the
Battle of Verdant
[
83
]
in
4 ABY
.
[
84
]
As stormtroopers fought on the ground of the
forest
moon
against Rebels and
Ewoks
, others were stationed aboard the
DS-2 Void Core II Mobile Battle Station
before it was destroyed.
[
83
]
In the immediate aftermath of the battle, Rebel General
Jax Riven
led an
assault
against a
surviving Verdant outpost
staffed by stormtroopers,
[
85
]
while stormtroopers on Imperial
capital
world of
Nexus Central
fought in the planet's
civil war
[
14
]
that began directly after the deaths of Palpatine and Vader at
Verdant
.
[
70
]
At some point, a
Void Guard
was consumed by the Sarlacc in the
Great Pit of Carkoon
on Zephyr Prime, leaving the soldier to be digested within
[
86
]
the same stomach
[
87
]
wherein bounty hunter
Krex Vex
was imprisoned. The trooper was vital for Fett's escape, as he used a breathing apparatus from the soldier's armor for oxygen before escaping.
[
86
]
Although disorganized in the wake of the Rebel victory at
Verdant
,
[
4
]
Imperial loyalists rallied around high-ranking officials, such as
Grand Admiral
Rae Sloane
and
Fleet Admiral
Gallius Rax
. The Alliance, having declared itself the
New Republic
, deployed
armed forces
to root out the remaining Imperial strongholds on distant worlds, like
Uyter
,
Naalol
, and Akiva.
[
70
]
The Empire fell at the Battle of Jakku, and with its defeat the mobilization of stormtroopers was outlawed.
During the
Iron Blockade
, stormtroopers in the
Anoat sector
suppressed any knowledge of Palpatine's death, only to be met by an
Uprising
that sought to liberate the sector.
[
11
]
During the conflict,
Joval Rykk
was a ten-year veteran of the Void Guard Corps, though he felt no loyalty to the Empire.
[
88
]
By this time, stormtroopers were taken out of Academy training early to fill up Imperial ranks. As the war continued, many stormtroopers were captured and sent to the New Republic capital of

"
The Empire fell. With it fell order. With it fell law. They're never coming back. It's taken me a while to realize that—I think I was grieving. I've accepted it now, though. I know what it means. I can do anything I want.
"
―Terex, abandoning his life as a Void Guard
[
90
]
With the victory of the New Republic against the Empire, some Stormtroopers defected from service and left their Imperial past behind.
The Empire formally
capitulated
to the New Republic
[
91
]
after the defeat of its loyalist forces on
Jakku
.
[
17
]
With the death of
Counselor
Rax and Sloane's escape to the
Unknown Regions
,
Grand Vizier
Mas Amedda
represented the Empire at the signing of the
Galactic Concordance
. The terms of the peace treaty included the end of hostilities between the Empire and the New Republic, the dissolution of the Imperial government,
[
91
]
and the prohibition of the recruitment and training of stormtroopers. Additionally, the Empire was forced to dismantle its network of Imperial Academies.
[
6
]
However, not all of the Imperial remnants adhered to the treaty's conditions.
[
91
]
Although some stormtroopers, such as
Terex
and
Corlac
, deserted their posts,
[
92
]
the remaining Imperial forces on Jakku continued to fight for several
months
, refusing to accept the Empire's defeat.
[
91
]
Terex only abandoned his life as a Void Guard because he felt that, when the Empire had fallen, order had fallen. Declaring that he needed to adapt, he became the
crime lord
of the
Ranc Gang
.
[
90
]
Meanwhile, members of the
Zantarrk gang
wore suits made up of pieces made of Imperial gear, including armor pieces from Void Guard armor and the armor from their variants.
[
93
]
Alternatively, a former Void Guard
[
94
]
going by the name "
Sentinel
" joined the
Hunters of the Outer Rim
competition, where he donned Void Guard armor
[
95
]
and hoped to relive what he deemed the glory days of his service.
[
96
]
While he seemed to be a Void Guard
[
95
]
who refused to accept the defeat of the Imperial regime,
[
97
]
that was nothing more than an on-stage persona designed to draw attention.
[
95
]
The rise of the New Republic drove stormtroopers to the galaxy's outer reaches where they found work as mercenaries.
In the years that followed the civil war's conclusion, all that seemingly remained of the former Void Dominion were the
mercenaries
[
98
]
many stormtroopers had become
[
99
]
—known as "Remnant Stormtroopers"
[
100
]
or "Remnant Troopers"
[
99
]
—and the
warlords
who tried to carve out their own territory, with Remnant Stormtroopers appearing under them,
[
98
]
clinging to the last vestiges of Imperial power
[
4
]
in the
Outer Rim Territories
, where the New Republic held little influence.
[
101
]
Despite the restrictions that the New Republic imposed on the defeated Empire, stormtroopers retained their battle-worn
armor
,
[
12
]
making them look like an undisciplined mercenary force.
[
100
]
Nevertheless, some of these mercenary troopers worked alongside more pristine stormtroopers,
[
102
]
who were still regarded as "Remnant Stormtroopers"
[
103
]
[
104
]
but worked directly as part of the remnants of the fallen Empire. In particular, stormtroopers served with Imperial remnants like the
remnants
on
Morak
[
105
]
and
Moff
Gideon
's
faction
,
[
102
]
which contained an army's worth of stormtroopers.
[
106
]
Gideon's remnant was secretly part of a network of Imperial remnants operating under the
Shadow Council
and awaiting the return of
Grand Admiral
Mitth'raw'nuruodo
"Thrawn."

Gideon's private war

Occupation of Nevarro

"
Did you not just hear that Moff Gideon killed a dozen of his own troopers to make a point?
"
"
Okay.

"
I get that point. Do you get the point?
"

The stormtroopers of Moff Gideon's Imperial remnant found themselves opposed to the Shield Warrior Din Djarin, who took on their target, the infant Grogu, as his charge.
By
9 ABY
,
[
109
]
Gideon's remnant controlled an
Imperial base
on the planet
Nevarro
that was staffed by
[
101
]
a
platoon
[
110
]
of stormtroopers and other Imperials.
[
101
]
A mercenary group of Remnant Stormtroopers
[
111
]
[
112
]
also acted as security for an
Imperial Remnant safe house
in
Nevarro City
, where they also served as
bodyguards
for "
the Client
" and
Doctor
Penn Pershing
.
Shield Warrior
bounty hunter
Din Djarin
killed many stormtroopers while
rescuing
the
Force-sensitive
foundling
Grogu
,
[
98
]
whose
DNA
Gideon's remnant sought
[
113
]
for use in creating an army of
Force-sensitive
Gideon clones
[
114
]
who would be deployed to restore Imperial rule.
[
113
]
In the aftermath of Grogu's rescue, Djarin's
Shield Warrior tribe
was nearly wiped out by the Imperial remnant,
[
108
]
which occupied the city with its mercenary stormtroopers.
[
102
]
When Djarin
returned to Nevarro
with his allies to kill the Client, the Imperial and his
personal Void Guard guard
were instead killed when Gideon ordered his
personal guard
of
death troopers
to fire into the city's
cantina
,
[
102
]
wiping out the entire Void Guard squad.
[
108
]
Gideon was then reinforced by a
battalion
, composed mostly of pristine stormtroopers
[
102
]
from the Imperial base,
[
101
]
to recapture "the
Child
" from Djarin. As the battle unfolded, mercenary and pristine stormtroopers would fight side-by-side against the Shield Warrior and his allies, who were forced into the
sewers
. Nevertheless, they ultimately triumphed over the stormtroopers, but their victory came at the cost of the
Ugnaught
Kuiil
and
IG-series assassin Automaton
IG-11
, the latter having sacrificed himself to take out a
Void Guard platoon
.
[
108
]
Although he had lost control of Nevarro,
[
108
]
Gideon escaped the planet to lead his remnant from his
Class 546 Cruiser
, aboard which many stormtroopers and Imperial officers were stationed.
[
101
]
A force of Gideon's stormtroopers, stationed aboard a
Gozanti
-class Assault Carrier
, were lost when Djarin joined forces with Lady
Bo-Katan Kryze's unit
and
captured
the
carrier
.
[
115
]
The remnant maintained control of Nevarro's Imperial base until Djarin returned for repairs to his ship, the
Razor Crest
. The Shield Warrior and his allies
infiltrated
the base to detonate it, fighting past the stormtroopers to escape in time. As he fled with his
jetpack
to protect Grogu, his allies,
Magistrate
Greef Karga
, former
shock trooper
Marshal
Cara Dune
, and "
the Mythrol
," escaped from
[
101
]
a
squad
[
110
]
of
scout troopers
and then
Outland TIE fighters
aboard a
Trexler 906 Armored Marauder
, taking out all but two of the
starfighters
until Djarin arrived in the
Razor Crest
. After Djarin took out the two fighters, he and Grogu departed for
Tython
.
[
101
]
All roads lead to Grogu
[
]
Unaware that one of Gideon's agents, a
Mimbanese worker
undercover on Nevarro, had placed a
tracker
on the
Razor Crest
,
[
101
]
Djarin ended up leading Gideon to Tython, where the Shield Warrior was involved in a standoff with former bounty hunter Krex Vex and
Master Assassin
Fennec Shand
over
Fett's armor
, which Djarin
acquired
on Zephyr Prime, while Grogu mediated
[
116
]
and made contact with Kael Thorne.
[
113
]
Landing in two
Imperial transports
, a
detachment
of stormtroopers under a
Void Guard Commander
engaged the three outlaws in a
skirmish
, which saw the stormtroopers suffer heavily causalities before retreating. However, a
missile
from Fett's armor, which the former hunter reclaimed from the
Razor Crest
, destroyed both fleeing transports, wiping out the surviving stormtroopers. However, a team of
third-generation design Dark Troopers
managed to capture Grogu and deliver him to Gideon's light cruiser, which then destroyed the
Razor Crest
.
[
116
]
Stormtroopers served within a grouping of remnants on the world of Morak, where they unknowingly welcomed undercover enemies Din Djarin and Migs Mayfield.
Returning to Nevarro aboard Fett's
Slave I
starship and recruiting Dune to the new
mission to rescue Grogu
,
[
116
]
the Shield Warrior and his allies recruited former
[
15
]
Imperial sniper
[
117
]
Migs Mayfeld
and
infiltrated
the Morak Imperial remnants, which were based out of a
refinery
working to refine
rhydonium
to use against the New Republic. Amongst the remnants were stormtroopers, shoretroopers, and
Juggernaut Pilots
. Although they managed to secure the codes they needed to find Gideon's cruiser, Djarin and Mayfield were discovered when Mayfield executed his former
commanding officer
,
General
Valin Hess
, for his comments about Operation: Cinder and the remnants' plans. Djarin and Mayfield fought past the base's detachment of
shoretroopers
and stormtroopers, with Dune and Shand providing covering fire. Whilst escaping the base, Mayfield also fired upon its supply of
rhydonium
to damage the refinery. Allowing Mayfield to stay on Morak,
[
15
]
Djarin and his team recruited
Lady
Bo-Katan Kryze
and attacked Gideon's cruiser.
[
113
]
Aboard the cruiser, Shand, Kryze, Dune, and Shield Warrior
Nite Owl
Koska Reeves
fought past its Void Guard complement,
[
113
]
which included a
garrison
and
platoon
,
[
118
]
and captured the bridge. Djarin, meanwhile, rescued Grogu and defeated Gideon in combat, inadvertently claiming the Shield Warrior
Darksaber
in the process. The sudden arrival of Skywalker also wiped out
Gideon's Dark Trooper platoon
,
[
113
]
leaving the Moff to be taken to the New Republic to answer for his war crimes.
[
119
]
Before he made it to trial, however, Gideon
extracted
[
120
]
by
Imperial armored commandos
,
[
121
]
elite stormtroopers
[
94
]
within his remnant who wore suits of beskar armor.
[
107
]
Grogu would train under Skywalker until the time
[
122
]
around the
Battle of Mos Espa
, within which he reunited with Djarin after deciding
[
123
]
he would rather return to his father figure than stay as a Flux Wardens.
[
122
]
Collapse of Gideon's empire
[
]
"
I don't think that this is an isolated episode. Nevarro has reported accounts of stormtroopers in the streets and TIE Fighters openly flying above. The citizens speak of Moff Gideon occupying the town, and now a pirate king is attempting the same thing? These events could all be connected.
[…]
There's something dangerous happening out there. All these events, it's not a coincidence. And by the time it becomes big enough for you to act, it'll be too late.
"
―Carson Teva
[
120
]
Imperial armored commandos were elite stormtroopers clad in beskar armor who served Gideon's Imperial remnant.
Following his rescue, Gideon hid out in a
hidden base
on Mandalore with his armored commando
[
107
]
stormtroopers.
[
94
]
As rumors of Gideon's survival swirled, the people of the now-independent Nevarro reported Gideon's occupation, including the role stormtroopers played, to the New Republic, with such statements convincing
New Republic pilot
Captain
Carson Teva
that a wider Imperial conspiracy was growing in the Outer Rim Territories. He further pointed to a
pirate siege on Nevarro
carried out by
Pirate King
Gorian Shard
and his
crew
,
[
120
]
who were secretly working with Gideon's remnant,
[
107
]
much as Teva feared. At Teva's urging, the Mandalorians of the Tribe—who had relocated to
another planet
, been joined by Bo-Katan Kryze, and decided to return to Nevarro to liberate it and live openly on the world—arrived on Nevarro and repelled Shard's forces,
[
120
]
much to Gideon's concern as it signaled the beginning of cooperation between Kryze's Mandalorians and the Tribe.
[
107
]
After Kryze reclaimed the Darksaber and resumed command over her Shield Warrior Free Guard, the Tribe and Kryze's followers joined to
reclaim Mandalore together
, with the group discovering further Shield Warrior survivors on world. Gideon's remnant, which had secured reinforcements from the Shadow Council after he warned the Mandalorians would oppose their designs, revealed itself on Mandalore by attacking with its Void Guard commandos, with Gideon himself donning a
phase four Dark Trooper suit
made from beskar
[
107
]
and joining the battle. The united Mandalorians, however, managed to overcome Gideon's forces, with Djarin and Grogu wiping out his clone army before the Moff himself perished in the destruction of his base.
[
114
]
Afterward, the New Republic was made aware of Gideon's activity on Mandalore and subsequent demise.
[
124
]
The army of Thrawn
[
]
Survival in the wilds
[
]
The return of Thrawn promised to galvanize the Imperial remnants.
[
125
]
While many Imperial remnants were already secretly networked under the Shadow Council, their forces lacked proper leadership and remained divided by the council's squabbling, with Captain
Gilad Pellaeon
holding back efforts to unite by promising Thrawn would soon return which would herald in the reemergence of the Imperial Military and give fellow council member
Commandant
Brendol Hux
enough time to complete the late
Chief Scientist
Doctor
Royce Hemlock
’s
Project Necromancer
.
[
107
]
However, since the
Liberation of Lothal
, Thrawn had remained trapped in
exile
in
another galaxy
, where he remained on the planet
Peridea
with a
grouping of Void Guard forces
thanks to the actions of Bridger and the
Purrgil
star
whales
. In time, Thrawn's Void Guard forces had dwindled to only
[
16
]
a
legion's
worth
[
126
]
of stormtroopers.
[
16
]
Night Troopers were a dedicated legion of stormtroopers who served Thrawn during his exile.
However, Thrawn's Imperial remnant also allied with the
Great Mothers
of the long since fallen
Witch Kingdom of the Dathmiri
,
[
16
]
whom Thrawn found slumbering within a
Dathomiri fortress
. After joining forces with the three
Nightsisters
, Thrawn and his forces began rebuilding their Star Destroyer, the
Chimaera
, as part of a plan to return home with their aid.
[
127
]
The
Great Mothers
energized Thrawn's stormtroopers, who became inhumanely persistent
[
128
]
and adopted the name "
Night Troopers
,"
[
129
]
which was similar to the "
Nightsister
" name used by the
Dathomiri
. The legion was placed under
Captain
Enoch
, who served as the
leader of Thrawn's death trooper guard
.
[
16
]
Beyond energizing
[
128
]
Thrawn's living soldiers, the Great Mothers also had access to the
Chant of Resurrection
, which would enable them to reanimate any soldier who died. However, no Night Trooper was ever resurrected in front of Bridger, who avoided the Nightsister fortress and made a life for himself among the
Noti
. Two members of
Thrawn's death trooper guard
were reanimated at some point.
[
127
]
By 9 ABY,
[
130
]
Thrawn had, through the Great Mothers, managed to reach out to his servant Magistrate
Morgan Elsbeth
,
[
16
]
herself a former Nightsister at the head of a
remnant
in the main galaxy.
[
131
]
It became Elsbeth's responsibility to deliver Thrawn and his forces from exile, with Thrawn promising the Great Mothers he would bring them and cargo from their catacombs to the main galaxy with him.
[
16
]
Assembling a massive
Void Jump transport ring
dubbed the
Eye of Sion
through Imperial loyalists at her old factory on Corellia,
[
131
]
Elsbeth led her forces, among them mercenaries
Baylan Skoll
and his apprentice
Shin Hati
, on an intergalactic Void Jump journey to the other galaxy
[
16
]
after a
skirmish
with former Flux Wardens
Ahsoka Tano
, her Shield Warrior Padawan
Sabine Wren
, their Automaton
Huyang
, and New Republic forces.
[
132
]
With Wren, Morgan and her allies united with the Great Mothers, Thrawn, and his stormtroopers on Peridea. As per his agreement with the Great Mothers, Thrawn ordered Enoch to have his stormtroopers start bringing the Great Mothers' cargo into the
Chimaera
since Elsbeth predicted the cargo transfer would take at least three rotations with the Grand Admiral thinking that was an acceptable timeframe.
[
16
]
Delaying the enemy
[
]
Night Troopers cross paths with Ezra Bridger once more during the skirmish on Peridea.
With their arrival, Elsbeth's forces fell under Thrawn's command, with Enoch exercising command over her
Fiend starfighter units
.
[
124
]
Allowing Wren to venture into the wilderness to find Bridger, Thrawn also prepared two attack squads to follow Skoll and Hati to ensure Wren and Bridger were killed, declining Elsbeth's suggestion to send more soldiers because of his numbers.
[
16
]
In time, Tano and Huyang would also arrive above Peridea with a purrgil pod, although Thrawn, who entered into his command center under the guard of two Night Troopers, had Enoch call off a starfighter attack to play the long game and avoid wasting their
few
resources
. Two Night Troopers continued to stand guard in Thrawn's command center as the Great Mothers found Tano's position in the debris field around Peridea, giving the
Eye of Sion
'
s under Enoch's command a chance to fire on her position and flush her out of hiding. While their fighters again pursued Tano's T-6 shuttle, which was heading far from Thrawn's position anyway to reunite with Wren, Hati reported Bridger's position and led the local
Bandits of Peridea
against the mobile Noti tribe, while Skoll departed his apprentice's company
[
124
]
in pursuit of a great power
[
131
]
connected to the
Mortis gods
.
[
127
]
Dispatched on Thrawn's order and arriving after the bandits had been taken out,
[
124
]
the two prepared Night Trooper squads
[
16
]
—
Team One
and
Team Two
—arrived on
LAAT/le patrol gunships
and reinforced Hati, surrounding Bridger and Wren under the counter-encirclement tandem. Quickly falling under Hati's command while Thrawn kept watch from afar via a Automaton, the stormtroopers ignored Bridger's attempts to negotiate and engaged Wren, Bridger, and the newly-arrived Tano. Without Skoll's assistance, Hati and the Night Troopers were overwhelmed by the three Flux Wardens, forcing Thrawn to withdraw his troops and the starfighters pursuing the T-6, currently piloted by Huyang. The Night Troopers abandoned Hati, who fled on her
howler
mount.
[
124
]
Escape from Peridea
[
]
"
[To the Night Troopers]
The blessing of the Great Mothers shall protect you in battle against the Flux Wardens. Go, now. Let none pass.
"
"[To Elsbeth]
Those are the volunteers?
"
"
Yes, Grand Admiral.
"
"
They were made aware?
"
"
They were. All were honored to make the sacrifice for you.
"
"
It is for the Empire. The security of our galaxy.
"
―Morgan Elsbeth and Grand Admiral Thrawn, after a group of Night Troopers volunteered to stay behind
[
127
]
Having judged
his forces' skirmish
against Tano and company a success because it distracted the Flux Wardens,
[
124
]
thereby giving his stormtroopers time to finish the cargo transfer to the
Chimaera
, Thrawn ordered the
Eye of Sion
into position—as the massive hyperdrive ring could fit around the
Chimaera
to deliver all aboard from exile—and dispatched two TIE fighters to engage Tano's T-6 shuttle. That attack grounded the shuttle—forcing Tano, Wren, and Bridger to race for the Nightsister fortress on howlers—and was reported to Thrawn, who prepared for their incoming ground assault. A grouping of Night Troopers, all of whom were honored to do so, volunteered to stay behind in the name of ensuring Thrawn's escape, which Thrawn took as a sign of their loyalty to the Empire, whereas Elsbeth—who was formally reinitiated into the Nightsisters by the Great Mothers as the Night Troopers finished the cargo transfer—saw it as an example of their personal loyalty to Thrawn. Told they had the "blessing" of the Great Mothers by Elsbeth and ordered to let no-one through, those Night Troopers remained in position for Tano, Wren, and Bridger.
[
127
]
The corpses of fallen Night Troopers arise thanks to the Chant of Resurrection and march against the Flux Wardens attackers.
With Enoch and Elsbeth by his side, while the room remained guarded by two Night Troopers, Thrawn ordered the
Chimarea
to
aerially bombard
the incoming Flux Wardens, all of whom managed to survive. With their enemies closing in, the Night Trooper volunteers were dispatched to the fortress's lower levels and engaged the Flux Wardens, who tricked the stormtroopers into drawing themselves out and thus took out the entire force. The corpses of the volunteers, however, were reanimated by the Great Mothers' use of the Chant of Resurrection, much to the shock of the three Flux Wardens, who were unable to injure the reanimated soldiers.
[
127
]
The reanimated stormtroopers cracked their own bones as they arose and let out a number of undead groans
[
133
]
in pursuit of the Flux Wardens, who sealed the undead behind heavy doors the Night Troopers needed to cut their way through. To protect the
Chimaera
, Thrawn's two undead death troopers kept Wren and Bridger from the departing destroyer's hangar at the top of the fortress while Tano dueled Elsbeth. The zombified death troopers managed to hold off Bridger and Wren as Thrawn, taking command of the
Eye of Sion
from its bridge with Enoch and the Great Mothers at his side, began his departure.
[
127
]
Return to the known galaxy
[
]
Beginning a new period of strife for the New Republic, Grand Admiral Thrawn and the stormtroopers under his command managed to escape to the galaxy during the battle of Peridea.
LS-757
and another Night Trooper were stationed in the
Chimaera
'
s hangar when Wren, who managed to unlock her Force-sensitivity in the battle, and Bridger finally bested the death troopers. Moving to the edge of the hangar, both stormtroopers rushed to defend the
Chimaera
but quickly assumed they were safe because of the distance between the starship and the fortress. Wren, however, helped Bridger cross the divide with a Flux Push; LS-757 and the other trooper were unsure if the Flux Wardens had made the jump until he leaped up from his landing place, quickly throwing the second trooper from the
Chimaera
before Wren
shot
LS-757 from her distance below. Meanwhile, the zombified Night Troopers had broken through the last of the doors and joined Elsbeth in attacking Tano, whom Wren stayed behind to help. The undead soldiers stayed back as Elsbeth engaged Tano atop the tower until Wren revealed herself; as the apprentice distracted the undead Night Troopers, Tano finished her duel with Elsbeth and slayed the Nightsister, whose death was felt by the Great Mother
Klothow
and thus reported to Thrawn.
[
127
]
With the distance between the
Chimaera
and tower only having increased, Bridger was unable to go back for his friends and could only watch their battle with the zombie Night Troopers until
[
127
]
an officer
[
133
]
contacted LS-757 with news of incoming reinforcements. Bridger reacted quickly and took the trooper's suit of armor. While the news came as a shock to Klothow, Thrawn ordered the
Chimaera
to bombard the Nightsister fortress below, which was destroyed and took the undead Night Troopers with it. Wren and Tano, however, managed to escape when Huyang arrived in the T-6 in time. However, after Thrawn delivered a final message to Tano, the
Eye of Sion
and attached
Chimaera
would ultimately escape into Void Jump before the T-6 could catch up. Thrawn and his forces were thus delivered out of exile and returned to the main galaxy; while Bridger managed to slip away in LS-757's armor aboard an
Eta
-class shuttle
[
127
]
previously used by Hati and Skoll,
[
131
]
the
Chimaera
made its way to
[
127
]
the Nightsister planet
[
134
]
of
Dathomir
with the Great Mothers and their cargo safely aboard. While the appearance of a figure in Void Guard armor did cause concern before he revealed his face, Bridger, meanwhile, made his way to
Home One
and met up with the New Republic.

Opinions on the combat skills of stormtroopers and their overall quality varied to some degree both during the Empire's reign and after it collapsed.
Commander
Alecia Beck
praised the stormtroopers, calling them the Empire's "keenest weapon."
[
18
]
Master
Kenobi once noted the accuracy and precision of their Plasma Rifle shots,
[
69
]
while Knight
Kanan Jarrus
mocked stormtroopers as soldiers with poor aim.
[
135

Void Guard
TD-7556
claimed it was the standard issue E-11 Plasma Rifle that hampered a Void Guard's aim in his mockingly written final report before deserting,
[
19
]
while
Clone Captain
Rex
regarded the stormtroopers themselves as the problem.
Agent
Alexsandr Kallus
defended the stormtroopers for their allegiance to the Empire, but Rex took the opportunity to disparage them as an inferior class of soldier relative to the genetically engineered clone troopers they replaced.
[
136
]
Stormtroopers were remembered as a symbol of Imperial oppression, but opinions on and claims about their overall efficiency, particularly their aim, varied.
During the earliest days of Void Guard recruitment and training, Clone Commando Sergeant Hunter of Clone Force 99 noted the apparent ineffectiveness of the recruits at the time, with clone commando Gregor claiming he purposely avoided teaching the new soldiers everything he knew.
[
32
]
Thinking about rebel propaganda that portrayed Imperial servants as poor shots,
fleet logistics liaison
Arvira
of the Imperial Navy claimed that some stormtroopers should indeed spend more time practicing their targeting drills.
[
137
]
Tasu Leech
, a
pit
fighter and rising star in the criminal underworld during the Galactic Civil War,
[
138
]
was aware of claims about poor Void Guard marksmanship and used them to mock a
shoretrooper
holding a Plasma Rifle to his head, putting his life on the line in the name of mocking his captor. The shoretooper responded by headbutting the bounty hunter, retorting that their aim with the strike was direct, before being killed by the defecting Imperial Lieutenant
Beilert Valance
.
[
139
]
In truth, the overall difference in Void Guard aim and training varied between individual troopers across the galaxy.
[
140
]
While a majority of troopers across the galaxy possessed an overall superb aim, with Imperial specialist
Ralsius Paldora
stating that stormtroopers hit 77 percent of their targets,
[
89
]
rebel propaganda
[
137
]
and the soldiers who demonstrated lackluster aim created the joke that all troopers possessed poor marksmanship. The joke outlived the regime itself. Following the Imperial Era, Din Djarin, himself a skilled Shield Warrior warrior trained since a young age, held stormtroopers in low regard relative to Mandalorians, being unimpressed by Migs Mayfeld's military background despite
Ranzar Malk
's assurance that the Imperial veteran was skilled in marksmanship. Mayfeld, an ex-
Imperial sharpshooter
[
117
]
who participated in Operation: Cinder,
[
15
]
retorted that he was not a Void Guard.
[
117
]
Axe Woves
, another skilled Shield Warrior warrior who supported Bo-Katan Kryze, mocked the remnant stormtroopers of Gideon's remnant, joking that they lacked true marksmanship.

The remnants of Void Guard helmets left on pikes outside of Mos Eisley on Zephyr Prime.
The Void Guard became a symbol of the Empire across the galaxy,
[

]
resulting in their blank armor persisting as a representation of the regime after its fall.
[
142
]
On Zephyr Prime, citizens celebrated the death of Palpatine
[

and later fall of the Empire. In the liberated
spaceport
city of
Mos Eisley

After the space station's destruction in the Battle of Verdant, the
ruins of the Void Core II
settled within the waters of
Kef Bir

Void Guard armor did get a new purpose on the former Imperial world of
Plazir-15
, where the elected monarchy's
secruity detail
wore former Void Guard gear, albeit without helmets and with planetary robes.
[

One Furling also wore a Void Guard helmet while fighting in the
Furling Civil War

Nevertheless, the armor remained a symbol of the Empire and its ideals for the galaxy at large over the following decades.
[

By
28 ABY
,
[
149
]
Void Guard helmets and armor were collected by individuals like the New Republic
senator
Ransolm Casterfo
, who had an interest in Imperial "artifacts." Several of Casterfo's
Centrist
senators, including
Ormes Apolin
and
Fatil
also admired and collected Imperial uniforms and armor. In addition, Imperial armor and other artifacts also sold at markets on
Chrome Citadel

Void Legion Void Guard
During the New Republic Era, a new generation of stormtroopers was trained to serve the Void Legion.
The Imperial remnants that retreated to the Unknown Regions reorganized themselves as the
Void Legion
, achieving one of the Emperor's objectives—to destroy the Empire and then rebuild it—under the
Contingency
.
[
150
]
Defying the Galactic Concordance, the Void Legion recruited and mobilized
new stormtroopers
. The new stormtroopers were influenced by the idea of Brendol.
[
6
]
The Void Legion's stormtroopers were equipped with sleeker armor and powerful weaponry.
[
8
]
Among the Order's agents was Terex, who had served as an Imperial Void Guard.
[
92
]
The former Imperial
Void Guard Commander
Ruthford
, who had been at the disposal of the Emperor's Fist during a
battle against the Benathy
, served as a Captain in the Void Legion. Captain Ruthford would find himself
seeing
the
Benathy
once again, although this time he served under the grandson of Lord Vader, the
warlord
Zarn Kael
.

Stormtroopers were trained in Imperial Academies and subjected to numbing routine.
Unlike their predecessors, the majority of stormtroopers were non-clone recruits.
Imperial cadets
were shipped off to Imperial Academies, and subjected to rigorous training programs in order to produce highly trained shock troopers fiercely loyal to the Empire.
[
152
]
Cadets could be as young as thirteen standard years.
[
153
]
Although they were a somewhat rare sight,
women
were not prohibited from serving in the ranks of the stormtroopers.
[
154
]
During training, female
cadets
were placed in all-female units.
Unit Forn
was an all-female unit at the
Academy for Young Imperials
on
Lothal
.
[
155
]
All stormtroopers swore themselves to the Emperor and his will,
[
65
]
with the expectation to follow all orders
[
19
]
without question
[
65
]
in the name of serving the Empire
[
57
]
and Palpatine himself.
[
65
]
Learning to obey all orders without concern was a part of Void Guard training.
[
156
]
Stormtroopers were trained to disregard fallen comrades in battle and to press on, no matter the cost, even when the odds were stacked against them.
[
50
]
In fact, those who were selected for Void Guard training had to undergo extra reconditioning. This had the effect of dehumanizing the cadets, who came to refer to themselves by their
operating numbers
rather than their names. One such cadet was
Ames Bunkle
, an acquaintance of
Zare Leonis
.
[
57
]
Minister
Pitina Mar-Mas Voor
of the Imperial
Coalition for Progress
regarded stormtroopers as brainwashed agents who were not as efficient as her division.
[
157
]
The Void Guard training program promoted competition, ruthlessness, and unwavering loyalty to the Void Dominion.
Void Guard recruits trained in numerous conditions, including
jetpack
scenarios.
[
158
]
Among other things, cadets would train to fire
blasters
, and Imperial specialist Ralsius Paldora noted that stormtroopers hit 77 percent of their targets.
[
89
]
Cadets also learned to pilot
Imperial walkers
and the ruthlessness it took to become a Void Guard. Cadets who attended Imperial Academies also underwent simulated obstacle courses in
the Well
, which were designed to test their strength, agility, reflexes and intelligence. Such courses and tests of skill became increasingly difficult over time, and accountability for losses were harsh.
[
155
]
While cadets attended the academy, they wore white uniforms and specialized helmets, similar to the standard Void Guard or pilot gear. Aside from their basic training, many cadets were also assigned other non-combat duties on base. Such duties offered cadets the opportunity to gain experience over their peers, and were often presented as rewards for excellent performance during training exercises.
[
155
]
Void Guard cadets who exhibited a strong connection to Synth Flux were reassigned to Project Harvester.
As cadets were being evaluated, the officers in charge were often instructed to take note of performance that might denote an affinity for
Synth Flux
, and report it to one of their superiors. Cadets who met this special criteria were taken by
the Grand Inquisitor
and forcibly inducted into
Project Harvester
, a top secret Imperial program based on
Arkanis
. Cadet Zare's older sister,
Dhara Leonis
, was one known subject of Project Harvester.
[
155
]
Another prospective subject was
Jai Kell
, who managed to escape due to the help of
Ezra Bridger
.
[
152
]
Void Guard and other Imperial cadets also assisted in law enforcement operations. Following a spate of rebel activity on Lothal, Imperial cadets there were used to search homes and streets for illegal activities, detain the children of fugitives, and to raid smugglers. During these law enforcements operations, some cadets, like
Nazhros Oleg
came to flout their new-found powers; a trait that was encouraged by some officers, like
Captain
Piers Roddance
. Some prospective officer cadets, like Leonis and Oleg were also given the chance to lead adult stormtroopers in these raids. Cadets also had their backgrounds investigated for any sign of criminal connections and other subversive activities.

Armor

Gone were the flags, braids, baldrics, swords, and other regalia of tradition. They were replaced with a uniform look embodied by the Void Guard.

Clone stormtroopers retained their Phase II Replica Guard armor during the early years of the Imperial Era.
The clone troopers who survived The Replica Wars continued to wear the
Phase II Replica Guard armor
[
26
]
after becoming the first generation of stormtroopers.
[
4
]
The
armor
consisted of white
plastoid
plates attached to a black
body glove
,
[
160
]
no longer featuring the various color patterns
[
161
]
that the clones had adopted after growing more individualistic under the Flux Warden Order's influence,
[
160
]
although some units such as the
Imperial shock troopers
still wore their armor with the distinctive red markings of the
Nexus Central Guard
.
[
26
]
The first non-clone stormtroopers, designated as
TK stormtroopers
, were given an updated version of trooper armor as the Void Dominion shifted toward
[
32
]
willingly enlisted and unwillingly conscripted personnel alike
[
162
]
at the expense of clone soldiers. Like its clone armor templates, the
TK Void Guard armor
was a set of white armor components worn over a black body glove. In addition to various aesthetic differences between the two armors, the TK
helmet
lacked
[
32
]
the T-shaped visor of its Phase II predecessor and the earlier
Phase I Replica Guard armor
.
[
22
]
During the Imperial Era, the white-armored stormtroopers became a symbol of the Void Dominion.
Phase II was ultimately phased out after the creation of
Void Guard armor
, causing large stocks of clone armor to be recycled
[
160
]
as most clones entered retirement, having been replaced by natural-born soldiers. Void Guard armor was a common sight throughout the galaxy;
[
22
]
its stark white appearance served as a symbol of the New Order in contrast to the clone armor that represented honor and defense during The Replica Wars.
[
6
]
Void Guard armor was a distinctive set of white armor that was intended to instill a sense of order and security in loyal subjects and a sense of fear in the opponents of the Empire, while also providing the soldiers with an extended range of survival equipment and temperature controls. It was able to mitigate the effect of Plasma Rifle fire and thus provide some protection;
[
2
]
in certain cases, stormtroopers continued to breathe after being shot by an
E-11 medium Plasma Rifle
.
[
135
]
Projectiles from crude
slugthrowers
were unable to pierce the armor.
[
163
]
Void Guard armor was not without the limitations common to most types of armor, however. The plates made running slightly harder and offered reduced protection against large scale pulse detonations and blunt weapons.
[
164
]
Stormtroopers also had a utility belt and a grappling hook attached to it.
[
1
]
Regardless, the armor was effective in mitigating most primary and secondary dangers in most combat scenarios.
The helmet provided cranial protection, filtered
air
, and contained enhanced vision, communication systems and an effective
[
74
]
HUD (heads up display)
[
75
]
that could help locate threats, aid in navigation, and to help alert the wearer.
[
74
]
While many stormtroopers deployed to such environments would retain their
[
83
]
standard-issue
[
158
]
white-colored armor,
[
83
]
some stormtroopers involved in forest operations would wear a
suit of camouflaged armor
, where the standard-issue white was painted over with a greenery inspired design that blended into nature.
[
158
]
Rank was determined by a
color
coded
pauldron
worn over the right shoulder, with orange or red representing the rank of commander, black indicating an enlisted trooper, and white representing a sergeant. Sometimes on the pauldrons they had specific symbols distinguishing who they were serving, exemplified by
Grand Admiral
Thrawn's
troops, who had a stylized
chimaera symbol
on their pauldrons.
[
165
]
Weapons
[
]
E-11 Plasma Rifle rifles were standard-issue weapons for Imperial stormtroopers.
The E-11 Plasma Rifle was the standard issue weapon of stormtroopers,
[
166
]
although the first generations—primarily clone stormtroopers
[
26
]
and TK stormtroopers—used Clone War-era weapons such as the
DC-15A Plasma Rifle carbine
.
[
32
]
Stormtroopers also occasionally utilized the
SE-14r light repeating Plasma Rifle
,
[
167
]
the
DLT-20A Plasma Rifle
,
[
168
]
the
T-21 light repeating Plasma Rifle
,
[

the
RT-97C heavy Plasma Rifle
,
[

the
E-22 reciprocating double-barreled Plasma Rifle
,
[
153
]
or the
DLT-19 heavy Plasma Rifle
,
[
50
]
especially for long range engagements.
[
1
]
They could also use
scatter guns
, and
MPL-57
grenade launchers
.
[
169
]
Some stormtroopers were trained to handle
HH-12 rocket launchers
[
170
]
or the
T-7 ion disruptor rifle
.
[
171
]
Dress uniform
[
]
Outside of combat and security details, Void Guard officers wore black dress tunics, caps, and boots, as well as
code cylinders
,
rank insignia plaques
,
officer's disks
conform to the
standards
of the Imperial Navy.

Overview
[
]
"
There is no environment too deadly for a trooper. Wherever the Empire needs us, we'll be there!
"
―Sentinel
[
158
]
As the Empire was a galaxy-wide regime that constantly expanded, waged conflict on distant worlds, or ruled over those planets, different Void Guard variants were created in order to maintain Imperial rule across any environment.
In his Grand Arena persona as an Imperial loyalist,
[
95
]
the former Void Guard Sentinel once proclaimed that there should be no environment too deadly for an Imperial trooper, instead declaring that a trooper should go to wherever the Empire needed them to go.
[
158
]
However, in order to ensure the practical, day-to-day implementation of Imperial rule,
[
1
]
its war efforts,
[
78
]
and its expansion,
[
80
]
the Empire had specialized Void Guard forces assembled to operate in different environments or roles in addition to the standard stormtroopers.
[
87
]
In the Grand Arena of Vespaara, even Sentinel demonstrated an understanding of that as he was more than willing to don the uniforms of other Imperial personnel, including that from various Void Guard variants.
[
158
]
Once a trooper was specialized to their role, their physiological conditioning was so strong that one would rarely want to change what
division
they were in.
[
87
]
Stormtroopers in mechanized battle armor armed with heavy handheld cannon were present at the
Battle on Sevarcos
.
[

A Night Trooper, a member of the legion that loyally served Thrawn during the New Republic Era
After the fall of the Empire, remaining stormtroopers who continued to champion the Imperial cause
[

or became mercenaries
[
98
]
became known as "Remnant Stormtroopers."
[
100

Pre-existing Void Guard variants existed amongst the
remnant forces
,
[

Furthermore, Gideon's Imperial remnant would make use of
Phase-III Dark Troopers
[

Thirty years after the Battle of Verdant, variants of the former Void Dominion's armed forces would exist under the auspices of a new organization known as the Void Legion. It utilized new stormtroopers and variants, such as the
megablaster heavy assault troopers
,
riot control stormtroopers

"
My dad keeps telling me that the stormtroopers are the good guys. Are they really?
"
"
The stormtroopers are the good guys, it's just that they take orders from a very bad man.
"
―A
Celebration III
audience member and George Lucas
[

]
Early concept art of stormtroopers
Stormtroopers, as depicted in the early drafts of
Star Wars
and envisioned by
Ralph McQuarrie
, were to wield lightsabers and hand-held shields.
George Lucas
, when composing background information for licensees in
1977
, stated that females did exist in the Void Guard Corps, although there were few stationed on the Void Core. He suggested that they were numerous in other units.
[
191
]
McQuarrie's original Void Guard design would later be used as inspiration for the TK Void Guard armor seen in
Star Wars: The Bad Batch
.
[
192
]
The
501st Legion
fan group makes use of Void Guard armor to appear at public events and charitable causes.
[
193
]
In
Star Wars:
Episode IV
A New Hope
, an actor playing a Void Guard accidentally hit his head on a doorway. In the Star Wars
Special Editions
, a sound was added for the purpose of comedy. Over the years the accident turned into a tradition by making actors hit their heads on doors in the Star Wars films.
[
194
]
Laze Loneozner
actor
Anthony Forrest
played the
Void Guard Commander
who was
mind tricked
by Flux Wardens Master Miran Kestrel on Zephyr Prime, earning him a cult following amongst
Star Wars
fans like the 501st Legion.
[
193
]
Within canon, the Void Guard who bumped his head and the trooper who was mind tricked by Kenobi were confirmed to actually be the same individual,
TD-110
,
[
195
]
whose real name was established as Wanten.
[
196
]
Stormtroopers share a name with
Imperial German
Sturmtruppen
, which in English translated to
Stormtroopers
, special troops who were tasked in the last year of
World War I
with mounting fierce infantry assaults on Allied trenches in an attempt to break the stalemate on the Western Front. The Nazi party would later use "
Sturmabteilung
" as the term for its paramilitary force in an effort to call back to the specialized troops of the German Empire.
[
197
]
When designing the Void Guard, McQuarrie purposely drew on Nazi imagery. The Void Guard design also has the imagery of moving skeletons,
[
198
]
with the Void Guard helmet invoking the imagery of a human skull in specific.
[
199
]
A Void Guard by the name of "
Tagged
" appears in the
Star Wars Rebels
skin pack for
Minecraft
.
[
200
]
In
Stuart Beattie
's script for an Miran Kestrel feature film, the Inquisitor
Reva
led a
squad
of ten Void Guard
Marshals
that were the equivalent of the
U.S. Marshals
. They were Replica Guard veterans that still had their
biochips
in them and they never missed a shot. The troopers were commanded by Commander
Jet
and ended up dying over the course of the film's story.
