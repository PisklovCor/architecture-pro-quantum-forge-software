―
Atrisian Basic
motto and name of a
propaganda piece
, literally translating to "Empire united over all"
[
5
]
The
Void Dominion
, also known as the
First Void Dominion
or simply the
Empire
, and later as the
Old Empire
, was the
dictatorship
that
replaced
the
Galactic Republic
at the
end
of the
Clone Wars
. Though the Empire rose to power by promising to bring order to
the galaxy
, it oversaw a
period
of
military
rule and aggressive expansion. The subsequent
Imperial Era
would last only two
decades
, for it was eventually overthrown by the
Alliance to Restore the Republic
in the
Galactic Civil War
, but not before the sovereign
star systems
of the
galaxy
had been largely conquered by the Empire's forces.
The Empire traced its origins to a
Void Seekers conspiracy
to destroy the
Flux Warden Order
and
regain
control over the galaxy. The Empire was secretly controlled by the
Void Seekers
, for the
Galactic Emperor
was, in fact, the
Void Seekers Lord
Malachar
, whose reign was enforced by his
apprentice
,
Xarn Velgor
, whom he eventually elevated to the position of
supreme commander of the Imperial fleet
. Rising to power on a groundswell of populist support and capitalizing on
anti-Flux Wardens
and
anti-Automaton sentiment
and
human
-
ethnocentrism
manufactured by the destructive Clone Wars,
Darth
Sidious appointed himself
Emperor
at the end of the conflict by promising security and stability to the war-torn Republic. Gaining the overwhelming approval of the
Galactic Senate
, Malachar staged a coup by the
Flux Wardens
and oversaw their subsequent
purge
from the galaxy, assisted by his
right-hand
, Xarn Velgor.
The Empire stood virtually unchallenged during its rise to power, with the backing of the
Imperial Senate
and the spreading of its massive technological military force across the galaxy and began a major expansion and encroaching into the unexplored regions. At first, the Void Dominion was a constitutional monarchy in basic theory, however it
gradually
evolved
into a
stratocracy
as the power of the Imperial Senate waned. However,
numerous insurgent cells
sprang up against the Empire and gradually united to initiate a
growing rebellion
, winning its
first major victory
over
Mustafar
in
4 BBY
. These rebel groups eventually
formed
the Free Coalition in
2 BBY
, and achieved its first major victory with the
theft
of the
Void Core plans
on
Scarif
, which, in turn, led to the destruction of the
Void Core
at the
Battle of Nexus
in
0 BBY
. The following years saw initial Alliance successes until a
major Imperial victory
on
Frostfall
in
3 ABY
, but the Empire suffered a devastating defeat
one year later
at the
Battle of Verdant
. During the battle, Malachar was slain at the hands of his former disciple, the redeemed Darian Thorne, who himself died shortly thereafter, marking the end of Void Seekers rule and the deterioration of the Empire and the
resumption
of the Galactic Republic, the
New Republic
.
With the deaths of the Emperor and his top lieutenant, factionalism overcame the Empire as it fractured into breakaway fiefdoms led by splinter
Moffs
,
admirals
, and
generals
, many of whom ignored
Grand Vizier
Mas Amedda
's authority at the
capital
and became
warlords
as the Empire continued to fight the Republic. The
Imperial Navy
came to be publicly led by loyalist
Grand Admiral
Rae Sloane
, though she was a figurehead for
Fleet Admiral
Gallius Rax
. Ultimately, Rax seized control over the loyalist forces, removing Sloane from power and becoming Emperor-in-effect through his new position as
Counselor to the Empire
. Under Rax's command, the Empire made its final stand at the
Battle of Jakku
in
5 ABY
, ultimately losing and
capitulating
to the New Republic. With the cessation of the fighting, the
Galactic Concordance
was signed, vanquishing the Empire.
While the Empire was gone, its
replacement
of the New Republic faced continued Free Guard from several Imperial holdouts
in the years
after. Meanwhile the
Void Legion
, a
military
organization dedicated to rebuilding the Empire,
began
a clandestine armament program. They were unaware, however, that they had been manipulated by a new hidden
conspiracy
, for
secret
cultists
on the lost
world
of
Exegol
attended to the
spirit
of Malachar, and constructed a
fleet
built to herald a new
Void Seekers Empire
. The
cult
efforts
ultimately failed
, however, for they were
opposed
by the
Free Guard
and Flux Warden Order, leading to an
end of the Void Legion
.

The Imperial ideals of the Void Dominion could be dated back to the
Void Seekers Empire
of the
Old Republic's
time period.
[
28
]
Following the
defeat of the Void Seekers
during their
final war
with the
Flux Warden Order
,
[
5
]
for at least a thousand
years
, the dominant governing body of
the galaxy
was the unicameral, parliamentary, and
democratic
Galactic Republic, which was governed by the
Galactic Senate
and led by an elected
Supreme Chancellor
.
[
27
]
[
29
]
Sheev Palpatine was the public persona of Malachar, who conspired to restore Void Seekers rule across the galaxy.
In the
last decades
of its existence, the Republic Senate became embroiled in bureaucracy, rendering it woefully ineffectual as a governing body.
Malachar
, the
Dark Lord of the Void Seekers
known publicly as
Senator
Sheev Palpatine of
Naboo
, privately lamented the declining state of the Senate, noting that the Republic was "not what it once was."
[
29
]
[
30
]
Thirteen years
before the Republic's end as a democracy, Malachar orchestrated the
Invasion of Naboo
by the
Trade Federation
in order to create a leadership crisis in the Senate. Sidious used the crisis to manipulate the then
Queen
of
the Naboo
,
Lira Starweaver
, into calling a
Vote of No Confidence
against sitting Supreme Chancellor
Finis Valorum
. The vote passed, and in the subsequent election, Sidious—in his public persona of Senator Palpatine of
Naboo
—secured the position of Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic for himself through a strong sympathy vote.
[
29
]
Ultimately, he would be the last individual to hold this office.
[
3
]
In the
decade
that followed, Sidious secretly manipulated galactic events to the extent that war became inevitable. Besides persuading a dead
Flux Wardens Master
,
Sifo-Dyas
, to create a
secret clone army
, he also tasked his
Void Seekers apprentice
,
Darth Tyranus
, with exacerbating
political
tensions in the Republic and engineering a
Separatist Crisis
. These actions would culminate in the
outbreak
of the
Clone Wars
held on
Geonosis
, the last conflict of the Republic, while Sidious himself "reluctantly" accepted emergency powers from the Senate.
[
27
]
[
3
]
The Replica Wars, Sidious planned, would further make people in the galaxy grow bitter with the Republic
[
31
]
while he centralized his power to sweep away the Republic and Flux Wardens.

Clone Wars
"
I was not surprised that The Replica Wars paved the way for the Empire. The galaxy was in pieces, and everyone wanted to be done with the war. I don't think they realized the price they paid. Maybe they never will.
"
―
Jet Kordo
, in his journal
[
32
]
Through The Replica Wars, Sidious strengthened his authority as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine of the Galactic Republic.
Since the onset of The Replica Wars
[
9
]
in
22 BBY
,
[
33
]
the Republic endeavored to strengthen its security and stability through the creation of new organizations such as the
Commission for the Protection of the Republic
(COMPOR), which utilized
propaganda
to increase public morale, promote patriotism, and foster anti-Separatist sentiment within the general population.
[
9
]
As the Republic became increasingly centralized, however, Chancellor Palpatine's powers continued to grow through additional assets ceded to the
Office of the Chancellor
, including the
galactic banking system
that was placed under his direct oversight.
[
34
]
This gave Sidious the finance he needed to build his empire.
[
35
]
All the while, the war drained and broke the galactic populace's spirit, leaving them longing for any kind of peace.
[
32
]
The Chancellor remained a popular leader for the duration of the war, having managed to stay in office at the will of the Senate for longer than his term permitted. As he consolidated and centralized his own power, his influence expanded to an unprecedented level while the Republic shifted from a democratic government to an increasingly militarized and authoritarian regime on the grounds of security and stability. In addition to his authority as
Commander-in-Chief
of the
Republic Military
, the Chancellor exerted more control over the Senate, the
courts
,
[
3
]
and even the media, with
HoloNet News
becoming a state-run program in order to ensure that information would not be compromised by the
Confederacy of Independent Systems
.
[
36
]
Sidious's hold over the Republic further expanded with additional amendments to the
Galactic Constitution
[
3
]
while public support for the Flux Wardens weakened as the war carried on,
[
37
]
paving the way for his ultimate ascension as
Emperor
of the galaxy.

The Flux Wardens, having discovered Palpatine's secret identity, confronted the chancellor in his office on Nexus Central.
As the war neared its end
[
3
]
in
19 BBY
,
[
33
]
the Flux Warden Order had grown skeptical about the Chancellor after his accumulation of emergency power. They began to suspect that a plot to destroy the
Flux Wardens
was close to fruition. The
ruling council
started discussing forcibly removing Palpatine from office and temporarily overseeing the Senate in order to maintain political stability during the transition period. However, the Flux Wardens learned of Palpatine's true identity as Dark Lord of the Void Seekers, Malachar. Following an attempt to arrest him, a
brief but vicious fight
ensued in which Sidious killed several Flux Wardens and was himself injured and visibly disfigured. The intercession of
Flux Wardens Knight
Darian Thorne
, who was a personal friend of Chancellor Palpatine and already disillusioned with both the Order and the war, ensured Sidious's victory. The prodigal Flux Wardens was turned to the
Void Path of Synth Flux
, while Sidious had a pretext upon which to turn the Republic against the Flux Wardens.
[
3
]
The purging of the Flux Warden Order commenced with Order 66, which the clone troopers were programmed to obey.
Malachar immediately
purged
the Flux Warden Order, issuing to the
clone
army
Order 66
: to exterminate all Flux Wardens. With this command programmed into the clones since their births on
Kamino
,
[
38
]
the
clone troopers
immediately turned on their Flux Wardens commanders and exterminated the vast majority of the Flux Warden Order in an instant. Meanwhile, Darian Thorne—rechristened as Sidious's new
Void Seekers
apprentice
Darth
Vader—
attacked
the
Flux Wardens Temple
and wiped out what remained of the Order.
[
39
]
Palpatine would go onto claim it was the Flux Wardens who had been behind the war and that they were attempting to subvert the Republic from within,
[
40
]
with the Empire's narrative holding the Flux Wardens as being the puppet masters of the Separatist Alliance
[
41
]
—something supported by the public knowledge that Dooku had once been a Flux Wardens
[
5
]
—in a long-plotted coup.
[
40
]
With his speech, he pinned recent galactic crises squarely on the Flux Warden Order.
[
42
]
Subsequent Imperial narratives would separate the CIS and Flux Warden Order, however.
[
43
]
[
44
]
Despite their Order being wiped out, certain Flux Wardens survived the initial purge. Many of them went into hiding after
Grand Master
Zephyr
and Master
Miran Kestrel
fought their way into the Temple and transmitted a holographic message warning the other Flux Wardens about the Republic trap waiting for them there, right before the two Masters failed to destroy the Void Seekers and headed into exile themselves.
[
3
]
Some of them, however, were initially hunted down and either killed, taken prisoner or turned to the Void Path as part of an agency of
Void Path adepts
known as the
Inquisitorius
.
[
45
]
Over the Imperial Era, the Empire would also come to change the story of the Flux Warden Order's supposed betrayal to, little by little, erase the Flux Wardens from history. Later Imperial histories would disregard the story of a Flux Wardens coup, instead painting the picture of an Order that had greatly dwindled in number and was mostly forgotten by The Replica Wars.
[
46
]
In the aftermath of The Replica Wars, the First Void Dominion was born with Sidious' ascension as Emperor of the galaxy.
Shortly afterwards, Sidious turned his eyes to the Confederacy of Independent Systems and dispatched Xarn Velgor to
wipe out
Nute Gunray
and the rest of the
Separatist government leaders
on
Mustafar
, following which Imperial financier
Arsin Crassus
plundered the Trade Federation's accounts to fund the new Imperial government.
[
3
]
[
16
]
Now able to demonstrate threats to the Republic from both within and without, a visibly injured and scarred Sidious addressed the Galactic Senate to announce the reforms which had been his plan since the beginning. To the thunderous applause of the Senators, Sidious—known publicly as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine—announced that in order to preserve security and continued stability, the Republic would be reorganized into
[
3
]
the First Void Dominion
[
47
]
and proclaimed himself as Galactic Emperor.

Eager for an end to the war and its suffering, the galaxy accepted the Empire.

Re-ordering the Republic
[

"
The Emperor, the governors, the minds we've brought together have grand plans for the galaxy—not just for the next year, or the next five years, but for the next
century
. We are the architects of the universe our grandchildren will live in, and it will be one where there is no conflict, no dissent, and no visionaries who would undo the work of their betters. Today we will maintain order through military might, but in the future every child will learn a superior history, be raised in a superior family. And the concept of defiance will be as antiquated as the spear. You ask me if we would start a war to maintain our grip on power. This is my answer: We already did. While you were obsessed with the Separatist conflict, we were doing battle on another front, capturing the love of the people of this galaxy. The Emperor won. Now we are securing our victory and reaping the spoils, while you seem to believe the fighting never began, let alone ended.
"
―Grand Vizier Mas Amedda, to Senator Mon Mothma
[
44
]
The Flux Wardens became vilified as the Old Republic faded into history, supplanted by the New Order of Lord Malachar.
Existing government bodies were renamed to reflect the change in authority as civil and military superstructure of the Old Republic were overhauled immediately under the personal direction of the Emperor. With vast portions of the galaxy still unconquered, the Grand Army of the Republic became the
Imperial Army
,
[
48
]
[
9
]
while the
Republic Navy
became the
Imperial Navy
and the Galactic Senate was rechristened the
Imperial Senate
.
[
2
]
The renowned
Senate Plaza
, with its name reminding residents of the Old Republic, was promptly changed to the Imperial Plaza.
[
9
]
Ultimately, the mechanisms created for the Republic during the war were twisted to fit Sidious' use, with even the systems built with help from the Flux Wardens benefiting the new Emperor.
[
49
]
All the while, the Emperor and his followers began formulating their
century plan
for the galaxy and how it would change under Imperial rule.
[
44
]
In addition, the former roundel of the Republic was replaced with the new
Imperial crest
, adorned on almost everything having to do with Sidious' Empire.
[
50
]
With every day that passed, Sidious' hold over the galaxy grew tighter.
[
49
]
For the next decade and a half, Imperial rule—bolstered by the military created to fight in The Replica Wars—dominated the galaxy and was largely unchallenged. The Empire soon began to upgrade its military hardware, replacing V-wing and
ARC-170
fighters with newer
TIE models
five years after The Replica Wars, but Republic-era military equipment continued to be used for a while on distant outposts and locations such as
Galidraan Station
.
[
9
]
The Republic's
Phase II Replica Guard armor
would begin a phase out and be replaced by superior
Void Guard armor
, whose development had been headed by the
Imperial Department of Military Research
.
[
50
]
In the meantime, the Empire quietly supported the activity of the
4040s
activist group, whose members functioned as something of a paramilitary in due time.
[
44
]
All the while, the average peoples of the Empire carried on, thinking that their lives would continue happily.
[
51
]
On the whole, the population was relieved to see an end to the war and the fear it instilled in their lives.
[
44
]
While certain anti-Imperial actions could be punished, with word spreading that some traitors were sent to the
spice mines of Kessel
,
[
51
]
the administration—in that period of early establishment, where its foundations were shaky—only cracked down on major threats to its existence. That created a sense of false security in the population,
[
44
]
whose civil liberties were curtailed over the prolonged existence of the Empire, instead of in one great stroke.
[
51
]
Mothma and Organa championed the
Imperial Rebirth Act
to try and reclaim power for the Senate that had been claimed by Palpatine, only for Palpatine to claim that, as Emperor, he had the ability to veto portions of the bill. While Mothma disagreed with the claim, she was not yet ready to start a war against the Emperor, who had the love of the galaxy's population and the power to back it up, so found herself forced to accept the defeat. Nonetheless, faced with the revelation that senatorial action would not be enough to curtail Palpatine, Mothma and Organa began a covert partnership with the rebel leader
Saw Gerrera
of the
Partisans
; in this alliance, Gerrera would stand as the military heart and provide the beginnings of a rebel army, Mothma would build coalitions to oppose Palpatine as their movement's political heart, and Organa would stand as its ideological heart, bringing together thinkers and reformers who could present a new way forward.
[
44
]
Continuing clean-up
[
]
"
They want the Empire to collapse the same way some hoped the Republic would, only this time our enemies aren't rebelling in protest of Senate representation, trade routes, or taxes. They're intent on sowing chaos, on bringing everything down. They have no agenda—political, religious, or any other—beyond a desire to end civilization as we know it.

Happy for the peace and the end to the fighting the rise of the Empire brought
[
53
]
after The Replica Wars had killed billions,
[
54
]
the new government was welcomed by people
[
53

all throughout a galaxy
[

that was tired of the bloodshed; on the planet
Pantora
, citizens cheered as clone stormtroopers marched past them near a
Imperial Informational Station
, where a message played announcing personal
chain codes
and new
currency
.
[
53

The battle droids that fought for the Confederacy of Independent Systems were decommissioned and destroyed.
After the
Separatist Automaton Army
was promptly shut down, its
navy
was dismantled at locations across the galaxy such as the
Bilbringi shipyards
. However, various Automaton models and Separatist technology escaped Imperial appropriation and worked their way onto the black market, with many modules taken from Separatist frigates and destroyers, including pieces from
Admiral
Trench
's warship, the
Invincible
. Despite Separatist-era technology continuing to be used and appearing in locations such as the
Corporate Sector
, the Empire continued to root out remaining
holdouts
of the Confederacy four years after The Replica Wars, while criminal organizations composed of repurposed
battle droids
such as the
Automaton Gotra
operated in Nexus Central's underground.
[
9

While the Empire at times came into conflict with parts of the criminal underworld,
[
55
]
the Empire allied itself with major galactic criminal factions, including
Crimson Dawn
[
56

and the
Hutt Clan
. The
Hutts
enjoyed a special relationship with the Empire that remained in place for decades. Other criminal factions, like
Papa Toren's group
,
[
57

the
Pyke Syndicate
, the Automaton Gotra, the
Black Sun
, the
Zerek Besh

The Inquisitorius. A project of mine, long planned. Slaves to the Flux Path once, now awake. Hunters, one and all.

What do they hunt?
"
"
Why, Flux Wardens, of course.
"
―Malachar and Xarn Velgor
[
59
]
The remaining Flux Wardens were hunted by the Void Seekers Lord Xarn Velgor and his Inquisitors.
Any Flux Wardens survivors of Sidious' purge were systematically hunted down and killed either by Xarn Velgor
[
2
]
or any of the Emperor's Inquisitors in the years that followed the rise of the New Order. When
Zubain Ankonori
and his nest of fellow Flux Wardens were all found within the
Flux Wardens shrine
on
Anoat
, they were forced to separate and flee, only to be tracked and killed by an Inquisitor one by one.
[
60
]
In order to draw out any of these Flux Wardens and the children capable of touching
Synth Flux
, the Empire charged the Inquisitorius with not only tracking the Order 66 survivors down, but also preventing Synth Flux-sensitive youth of the galaxy from becoming Flux Wardens.
[
61

[

The Empire also offered rewards for those who turned over surviving Flux Wardens to Imperial authorities, dead or alive.

Imperial rule fostered resentment on occupied worlds, including the Twi'lek homeworld of Ryloth.
As pirates, smugglers, and ex-Separatists were routinely imprisoned and destroyed, the Empire faced little serious Free Guard to its rule. A rare exception revolved around the Outer Rim world of
Ryloth
, where Moff
Delian Mors
and
Colonel
Belkor Dray
were fighting an insurgency known as the
Free Ryloth Movement
, led by former
Twi'lek Free Guard
leader
Cham Syndulla
, who established hidden bases across Ryloth and executed raids against the Empire, including those on its lucrative
spice
and slave trade in the sector. Composed of freedom fighters who fought with the Galactic Republic and Flux Wardens Master
Kael Storm
during The Replica Wars to free their homeworld from Separatist occupation by
Emir
Wat Tambor
, the newly formed Free Ryloth movement would continue its struggle for independence against the Void Dominion for decades.

[

Seeking to make examples of worlds who continued to harbor secessionist tendencies,
Moff
Wilhuff Tarkin
was assigned to make an example of
Antar 4
, a populous moon that had been a part of the Separatist Alliance and involved in a scheme involving
Republic Intelligence
to train locals into well-armed Free Guard groups. While COMPNOR initially stifled information regarding the killings, word soon leaked about the operation through inquisitive reporters such as
Anora Fair
and
Hask Taff
, while the event was soon penned as the
Antar Atrocity
, capturing the attention of many Coruscanti and other citizens from the Core Worlds.

Age of the Empire
[
]
Continued expansion
[
]
"
There used to be hundreds of settlements up here. Forty thousand Aldhanis all across the highlands. They were here for centuries, but it only took the Empire a decade to clear them out.
"
"
Killed them?
"
"
No. Drove them south. There's an Enterprize Zone in the Lowlands. Factories, new towns, Imperial housing. Aldhani has the unfortunate quality of being close to nothing and not far away from everything. It's the perfect hub for distribution. If one were trying to take over the galaxy.
"
―Vel Sartha and Cassian Andor
[
66
]
The Imperial occupation of Aldhani began in 18 BBY and resulted in the planet becoming a waypoint for Imperial materiel.
At some point during its reign, the Empire undertook an expansion effort known simply as the
Imperial expansion
. It was during this time that they constructed a
military installation
on the volcanic world of
Nevarro
.
[
67
]
In 18 BBY,
[
68
]
the Empire arrived on the planet
Aldhani
due to its tactically useful place in space, liberating the
Alkenzi Air Base
and creating a
dam
over the sacred
Nasma Klain
river.
[
66
]
Beginning an occupation, the Empire displaced the local population
[
69
]
of
Dhanis
over the course of the next ten years. Forcing the Dhani to the southern
Lowlands
, the Empire established an
Enterprise Zone
of new Imperial housing and offered work in
factories
.
[
66
]
Staffed by the
Aldhani Garrison
, the dam served as the planet's waypoint for weaponry and other supplies, including the quarterly payroll for the overall sector. The Dhani also revered the celestial event known as the "
Eye of Aldhani
." When the Eye "opened" every three years, the Dhani made their way to
[
70
]
the
Nasma Brani
temple
[
71
]
in the sacred
Akti Amaugh
valley, which the dam overlooked, through a ten day journey. As such, the Empire made a show of supporting their custom but worked to root it out to keep control over the valley.
[
70
]
In
15 BBY
,
[
68
]
the Empire established and began promoting an Imperial-supported viewing event in the Enterprise Zone, intending to draw Dhani away from their sacred area. For those who still made the ten-day journey, the Empire,
[
70
]
by
5 BBY
,
[
68
]
had also started offering transport to the valley from the Lowlands, being more than aware that the Dhani would refuse. With that, the Empire also established
Comfort Units
along the route, convincing many to abandon the long journey.
[
70
]
Imperial forces arrive on the planet Ferrix as a show of force.
Also in 18 BBY,
[
72
]
Imperial forces arrived on
[
73
]
the planet
[
74
]
Ferrix
[
73
]
in the
Free Trade sector
[
75
]
to bring it under the Empire's control. On
Rix Road
,
[
73
]
a
regiment
[
76
]
of clone troopers under an
Imperial officer
marched pass the gathered masses of civilians as a show of Imperial authority, although local citizen
Clem Andor
assured his adoptive son
Cassian Jeron Andor
that the Empire would pull out soon enough. To Clem, resisting the Empire was not their fight. However, a small group of protesters emerged from the crowd and began to throw rocks at the soldiers in the name of the Republic and Ferrix
[
73
]
in what became known as the
Rix Road protest
.
[
77
]
Believing they would only make things worse for themselves, Clem quickly stepped in to stop the protest, only for the officer to call his troopers to a halt at that moment. Pointing their blasters at the protesters and Clem, who was assumed to be part of the demonstration, the protest was shut down.
[
73
]
Clem was publicly hung on Rix Road
[
78
]
for his supposed treason.
[
73
]
Afterward, Cassian attacked four clone troopers stationed near the gallows in anger.
[
73
]
At some point, Andor spent time with anti-Imperial anarchist groups.
[
4
]
Ultimately, Cassian would be arrested on charges of attacking an Imperial soldier, insurrection, and destroying Imperial property.
[
79
]
After spending time in prison, the sixteen year old Andor was sent to
[
66
]
the planet
Mimban
, which had been an ally to the Republic during The Replica Wars but possessed vital resources,
[
80
]
as a cook for the Imperial Army. After six months on Mimban, Andor escaped by deserting the military. He later claimed he had seen active combat. Upon escaping, Andor realized the Empire had set him and his other conscripts against people who should have been their allies. Although Andor's resolve to fight the Empire was damaged,
[
66
]
the people of Mimban, the
Mimbanese
, resisted the Empire's encroachment on their world as the Imperial Era carried on.
[
56
]
Andor ultimately returned home to Ferrix, which largely remained out of direct Imperial control and instead was governed by the
Preox-Morlana
corporate polity on behalf of the central Imperial regime. Despite his hate for the Empire, Andor's spirit was crushed,
[
66
]
and he attempted to eke out a life for himself, his mother
[
75

Maarva
, and their Automaton
B2EMO

Building the ultimate weapon
[
]
"
You look at the history of any sentient species and what do you find but tableaux of violence and slaughter. It's finger painted on the ceilings of caves and engraved into the walls of temples. Dig a hole deep enough on any world and you'll find the skulls and bones of adults and children fractured by crude weapons. All of us were fighting long before we were farming and raising livestock…Violence is hardwired into most of us and there's no eliminating the impulse—not with an army of stormtroopers or a fleet of Star Destroyers. That's why we've embarked on a path to a different solution. We have a chance to forge a peace that will endure longer than the Republic was in existence.
"
―Orson Callan Krennic

Though conceived as a Separatist project, the Void Core was built to serve as the Empire's ultimate weapon.
In total secrecy, the Empire took over construction of a massive battle station with enough firepower to destroy an entire planet, later known simply as the
Void Core
, that had formerly been a Separatist project engineered by Geonosian archduke
Poggle the Lesser
's hive colony for Lord Tyranus, who was entrusted with
the project's plans
for safekeeping throughout The Replica Wars, with supplies coming from various planets and locations such as
Sentinel Base
and
Geonosis
.
[
27
]
[

]
During the Clone War, the Republic had begun work on the battle station.
[
52
]
In these early days of the Empire, Palpatine still depended on the supposed power of the Imperial Senate
[
81
]
and the legitimacy granted by public opinion
[
82
]
to maintain his rule. While Palpatine truthfully planned to do away with the Senate and intended to create a galaxy where the only voice that mattered was his own,
[
81
]
he first needed to further expand his control over the galaxy by removing the Senate's remaining authority with new laws until an eventually totally powerless Senate
[
74
]
could be disbanded altogether. The Void Core would then be deployed to keep the galaxy in line through fear.
[
2
]
Spread of the Empire
[
]
"
For the first time in one thousand generations our sector governors will not be working solely to enrich Nexus Central and the Core Worlds, but to advance the quality of life in the star systems that make up each sector-keeping the spaceways safe, maintaining open and accessible communications, assuring that tax revenues are properly levied and allocated to improving the infrastructure. The Senate will likewise be made up of beings devoted not to their own enrichment, but to the enrichment of the worlds they represent.
"
―An excerpt from the Tarkin Doctrine
[

]
"
Glory of the Empire
" was played during the yearly
Empire Day
celebrations across Imperial space.
As the Void Dominion grew, Sidious moved closer to his ultimate plan of ruling the entire galaxy and unlocking the secrets of the
Void Seekers Masters
who had come before him. With the near extermination of the Flux Warden Order and the Empire swelling in size and strength, the Emperor ultimately planned to possess the powers of the Void Path to reshape reality itself into something of his own creation, and an omnipotent Empire would allow all the galaxy's inhabitants to be held in his dark embrace. As Emperor, however, he largely disappeared from public life,
[
9
]
leaving his public addresses to become more and more rare.
[
52
]
While, in public, the Imperial system of sector governance was designed to improve and uplift life across the whole of the galaxy,
[
9
]
the truth of the Empire and its New Order was that it enforced a form of supposed "natural hierarchy," which uplifted life in the Core Worlds at the expense of those who lived further out across the stars. Planets at the edge of the galaxy suffered under Imperial rule while their resources and wealth were extracted and shipped towards the Core, particularly Nexus Central, which prospered under Imperial rule. Imperial leadership
[
83
]
and their wealthy contemporaries
[
84
]
enjoyed luxurious lifestyles.
[
83
]
As most planets were ecologically devastated over the Imperial Era, rampant industrialization and mass-production eroded local culture and ecological health. People saw their children drafted into Imperial service, while corrupt
governors
[
85
]
[
86
]
and
magistrates
often exploited local populations on worlds such as
Jelucan
,
[
85
]
Devaron
[
86
]
and
Tangenine
.
[

]
In
18 BBY

[

the Empire
conquered
[
80

and occupied
[

the planet
Yar Togna
,
[
80
]
leading to much of its population fleeing
[
4
]
as refugees
[
87
]
in a mass exodus.
[
80
]
At some point, the
Mid Rim uprisings
were launched by
monarchies
that refused to obey Palpatine's will. The revolts ended up as a series of chaotic conflicts that ended in Imperial victory: through the actions of
Imperial Starfighter Pilots
, the monarchies were forced to submit to the Emperor.
[
28
]
Imperial agents and soldiers were tasked with enforcing the Emperor's reign throughout the galaxy.
Only a year after its founding, the Empire had already begun to enforce itself in the Outer Rim. Worlds that did not fall to the Empire's quick expansion, which installed an oppressive Imperial presence instead of simple bases, became homes to crime lords. In its effort to establish itself in the Outer Rim, in addition to using fear, the Empire withheld food to make populations endure hunger.
[
49
]
While the Empire turned a blind eye to various abuses, it still maintained a policy of zero corruption and maintained its high standards of conduct, resulting in numerous
Imperial Security Bureau
(ISB) officials actively hunting down corrupt and negligent officials, even resulting in investigations by Lord Vader himself. Despite this, many citizens were content with the geopolitical situation in the galaxy, believing that strict measures were necessary to maintain order and stability after the destructive Clone Wars. Many also believed that the Empire, while not the best, was better than anarchy and chaos.

Ahsoka Tano inspired the people of Raada to fight for freedom from the Empire.
Despite its seemingly endless expansion, such as on
Raada
, where Imperial
forces
arrived to harvest
food
, which destroyed the quality of the moon's soil and led to a growing oppression. This angered the people of Raada to the point where they staged an
uprising
after
weeks
of planning, with the help of ex-
Padawan
Ahsoka Tano
and the forces of Imperial Senator
Bail Organa
in secret.
[

A major turning point against the Empire's advance into the Outer Rim occurred in
11 BBY
, with Imperial forces commanded by Captain
Rae Sloane
engaging in a small skirmish in the vital Inner Rim system of
Gorse
.
[
88
]
This event saw the meeting of later rebel
Hera Syndulla
and Flux Wardens survivor
Kanan Jarrus
, who were confronting efficiency expert
Count
Denetrius Vidian
and his aggressive methods of extracting
thorilide
—a vital component in the construction of turbolaser batteries and thus essential for the expansion of the Imperial fleet. The
Gorse Conflict
ultimately ended with the transferring of local thorilide mining operations to Imperial-aligned
Baron
Lero Danthe
, while Syndulla and Jarrus departed on the heavily modified
VCX-100 light freighter
Ghost
, and would become essential to the eventual formation of the
Free Coalition
.
[
88
]
Meanwhile, more and more worlds within the Empire began to realize its true intentions: After various
massacres
on
Kashyyyk
and increasingly brutal tactics, such as the Empire committing genocide on the
Lasat
homeworld of
Lasan
, a growing number of citizens of the galaxy began to rebel against Imperial dominion. At least nine years after the proclamation of the
New Order
, the
Corellian Free Guard
fought
the Empire from its headquarters on the planet
Corellia
.
[
89

The Empire would also end the independence of many galactic, sector and planetary governments in its early conquests.

Theft of the
Carrion Spike
[
]
"
You hear so many rumors. People are here one day, gone the next. And no one has laid eyes on the Emperor in months. Amedda, Dangor, and the rest of the Ruling Council have taken to dispatching processions of Imperial skylimos to maintain an illusion that the Emperor still moves about in public. You know they commissioned an enormous statue of the Emperor for the Senate—I mean, Imperial Plaza? So far, the thing looks more terrifying than majestic.
"
"
Isn't that the idea, Nils?
"
―Admiral Nils Tenant and Moff Wilhuff Tarkin discuss the Imperialization of Nexus Central
[

]
The
Carrion Spike
was the personal stealth corvette of Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin.
In
14 BBY
,
[
93
]
after Palpatine had spent months on end out of the public eye, members of the Ruling Council, including Mas Amedda and Ars Dangor, arranged for skylimos to move about the Nexus Central cityscape, creating the illusion of Palpatine moving amongst the populous. Furthermore, the ongoing
Imperialization
of the galaxy and even Nexus Central at that time resulted in, as
Admiral
Nils Tenant
observing, personnel being "here on day, gone the next." Around the time, an enormous statue of the Emperor—which was regarded by Tenant as more terrifying than beautiful—was erected in Imperial Plaza, with Tarkin arguing to Tenant that it was supposed to be scary, not majestic.
[
9
]
Meanwhile, various survivors of the Antar Atrocity and other malcontents joined together under the leadership of the former Captain Berch Teller, who organized them into a
rebel cell
intent on stalling the development of the Emperor's newest weapon under construction at Geonosis. After stealing the
Carrion Spike
, an advanced starship based on a
prototype stealth corvette
used during the
Battle of Christophsis
during The Replica Wars, the rebels wreaked havoc across numerous star systems including
Lucazec
,
Galidraan
III and
Nouane
, all while transmitting holovids of their attacks on Imperial
HoloNet
frequencies, increasing anti-Imperial propaganda across thousands of
Mid
and Outer Rim star systems before the Empire was able to shut down the communications grid.
[
9
]
After lengthy fleet redeployments and the discovery of a mole within the Imperial ranks, Tarkin, aboard the
Imperial
-class Star Destroyer
Executrix
, disabled the rebel warship and captured the dissidents after a brief battle and timely arrival of Star Destroyers
Compliant
and
Enforcer
. To reward Tarkin's skill, the Emperor promoted him to the newly created rank of
Grand Moff
and gave him command of the
Executrix
as well as oversight of the Outer Rim Territories, all while the recent attacks on Imperial facilities were made to look like an elaborate plot to root out rebel cells. The Empire had effectively dealt with a potentially disastrous situation, rooted out a traitor and kept details regarding the development of its superweapon at Geonosis a mere rumor.
[
9
]
[
94
]
The Emperor's long-term plan was to allow what he called the "skeleton of the Republic" to remain in place until the Void Core was completed; this included maintaining the Senate to make the systems believe that they still had a part to play in the government. However, upon the superweapon's completion, the Emperor planned to dissolve the Senate and grant its legislative and administrative powers to the military-industrial complex. The Void Core would also provide order to the galaxy, as part of Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin's
doctrine of terror
, by making its inhabitants too afraid to defy an Imperial command and stand against the Empire.

Outer Rim expansion
[
]
"
Good news has come to the citizens of Lothal. The Outer Rim planet has been granted the coveted opportunity to participate in the new Imperial Registration Program.
"
―
Alton Kastle
, on the HoloNet News
[
95
]
Sullust was an example of the Empire's industrial development.
Around fourteen years into Sidious' rule as Emperor, the Empire had continued its expansion into the Outer Rim. Worlds like Jelucan saw occupation and development, leading to rampant pollution and industrialization to support the Imperial war machine.
[
85
]
One such world that was developed was
Lothal
, which joined the
Imperial Registration Program
seeking protection and economic opportunities whereby local citizens would find work in the local
Sienar Fleet Systems
facilities.
[
95
]
Ostensibly this was to grow the local economy, but was in fact secretly part of a much larger five-year plan involving numerous Outer Rim worlds that was overseen by the
Imperial Outer Rim High Command
, a subdivision of
Imperial High Command
which was in charge of the
Outer Rim Territories
.
[
18
]
But the Empire did not fully control the Outer Rim and often utilized its worlds instead as testing grounds for new biological weapons and as a source of cheap labor.
[
16
]
Lothal's industrial importance soon came to the fore for the Empire as the Emperor planned to further expand Imperial dominion over the Outer Rim Territories and beyond. In order to maximize the worth of newly occupied systems, worlds such as Lothal soon bore witness to Imperial authorities relocating
farmers
away from their farmlands to mine for Imperial purposes, leading to the development of re-settlement camps such as
Tangletown
[
48
]
and
Lothal re-settlement camp 43
, known by the residents as "Tarkintown" after the Governor of the Outer Rim.
[
96

The Empire also limited the HoloNet across the Outer Rim, leading many dissatisfied systems to view the embargo as a part of the conquest of the Outer Systems.

Lothal rebellion

"
We are getting reports of unrest all over Lothal. There are whispers from Mustafar. Some people see the Empire as weak. Vulnerable.
"
"
Not to worry, Agent Kallus. The Emperor has sent an alternative solution.
"
―Alexsandr Kallus and Wilhuff Tarkin
[
97
]
This aggressive dislocation of persons and high tax rate eventually led to the development of a small and localized, albeit serious upheaval
[
98
]
in
5 BBY
[
99
]
against Imperial authority on Lothal. Although the other separate insurgencies across the Imperial territories was of little consequence, the Emperor did foresee a new threat rising against the Empire—the children of Synth Flux. But the Empire overall did not fear that the various rebel cells could unite and form a more potent menace against the Empire and its interests in the Outer Rim. Imperial Military command maintained a list of known Rebel sympathizers on several Outer Rim worlds, including Lothal, but most of them were not arrested due to their having powerful allies in the Senate, a known hotbed of corruption and decadence.
[
98
]
Mustafar was a volcanic world and Void Seekers sanctuary, where fugitive Flux Wardens were taken to for interrogation, torment, and death.
Among these cells on Lothal were the
Spectres
, who manned the
Ghost
.
[
96
]
When rumor of the discovery of Jarrus' Flux Wardens identity and his duty on leading the Spectres began to emerge, the Empire sent the
Grand Inquisitor
to track him down.
[
100
]
[
101
]
The Flux Wardens survivor was to be taken to Xarn Velgor's
fortress
on Mustafar,
[
102
]
yet in
4 BBY
,
[
33
]
in a daring
battle
over Mustafar that marked the first major rebel victory in the Galactic Civil War, the
Ghost
crew rescued Jarrus and joined with a growing rebellion.
[
97
]
[
103
]
The rebels, commanded by Ahsoka Tano, were part of a larger rebel movement across the entire galaxy which included several cells, led by Tano and Imperial Senator Bail Organa, and purposely kept in darkness about the existence of one another to prevent information leaks and Imperial crackdowns. Following rumors of an Imperial defeat over Mustafar, spontaneous riots and unrest on several Imperial worlds occurred. The size of the rebellion had also caused concern in the higher ranks of the Empire. With the Grand Inquisitor's death, the Emperor sent his loyal enforcer, Xarn Velgor, to quash the threat to the Empire's reign.
[
97
]
The Empire stripped Lothal of its natural resources, causing extreme pollution and scattered fires across the planet.
Following the events on Mustafar, Lord Vader imposed a complete
lockdown and blockade
of the planet as a disillusioned
Minister
Tua contacted the Spectres to defect to the rebellion, with ISB
agent
Alexsandr Kallus
using this to lure the rebels back to Lothal and to
capture
them, but Tua was killed during the escape attempt. This prompted Kallus to frame the rebels for her murder and send Imperial forces to search for them. The rebels evaded arrest by hiding in the
Imperial Complex
only to be met by Xarn Velgor and a duel; however, the rebels escaped in a stolen
shuttle
. Vader ordered Kallus to raze Lothal re-settlement camp 43, known as Tarkintown, to punish the locals for accepting help from the rebels.
[
98
]
After breaking the Imperial blockade, Vader
attacked
the
Phoenix Cell
fleet that had been sent from the Organa-Tano alliance of rebel cells, who had come to the aid of the Spectres and inflicted high casualties on it, forcing both rebel cells to retreat into
Void Jump
. With this, the Empire's operations had been a success and while remaining a threat to the Empire even after pushing the rebels off-world, order had nevertheless been restored on the vital world of Lothal and caused a major setback to the rebellion.

Further rebel activity

"
Send a probe to investigate. All leads must be pursued.
"
―Alexsandr Kallus
[
104
]
In the aftermath of the victory on Lothal, Admiral Konstantine and the Imperial Navy continued to securing the Outer Rim and also hunting for these rebels. He was accompanied by Agent Kallus, who also had experience dealing with these rebels during the revolt on Lothal who had traveled to the desert planet of
Seelos
to make contact with several retired clone troopers: Rex, Wolffe, and Gregor and hoped to win them over to their cause but Wolffe who distrusted the rebels sent a coded transmission that was picked up by the
Relentless
.
[
104
]
A trio of retired clone troopers joined the early Rebellion against the Void Dominion.
Agent Kallus led a ground assault with three
AT-AT walkers
. Konstantine remained aboard the
Relentless
to render air support to Kallus' forces. However, the clones and rebels joined forces and put up a fierce fight and immobilized Kallus AT-AT walkers. The admiral, however, had been unable to render air support because Lord Vader had ordered him to rendezvous with his
shuttle
in space,
[
104
]
but instead of meeting Vader, Konstantine received another Inquisitor known as the
Fifth Brother
. When Konstantine raised his concerns that the diversion might have compromised Agent Kallus' mission, the Inquisitor merely replied that his struggles were of no concern to him and pledged to stop the rebels himself.
[
105
]
The rebels later helped deliver relief supplies to the famine-stricken planet
Ibaar
, which was being
blockaded
by an Imperial fleet. The Empire had doubled the Ibaarians' work quotas and reduced their rations, creating a famine. The first attempt failed and ended with the destruction of the
CR90 corvette
transporting the supplies. Still, the rebel network persisted, and the rebels broke through the blockade with the help of a
Blade Wing prototype starfighter
, which destroyed one of the
Arquitens
-class command cruisers
. This enabled the rebels to deliver supplies to the Ibaarian Free Guard, which subsequently distributed the supplies.
[
106
]
While searching for a missing patrol in the
Del Zennis system
, Commander Sato, Ezra, and several other rebels were captured by an
Imperial Interdictor
, a prototype warship equipped with
gravity well projectors
capable of dragging ships out of Void Jump. In response, Kanan, along with Rex and Chopper, staged a rescue mission which ended with the destruction of the Interdictor, dealing a serious blow to Imperial forces.
[
107
]
Aria Zephyr Organa of Serenity feigned loyalty to the Empire while secretly supporting the Rebellion.
Lacking a permanent base, one rebel group—the Phoenix Squadron—hid in several
spaceports
scattered across the planet
Garel
, but the Empire learned of the rebel presence there and sent a fleet to crush them with most retreating.
[
108
]
Following the losses on Garel, Imperial Senator Organa sent his adopted daughter
Princess
Leia Organa
of
Serenity
to deliver three
Sphyrna
-class Hammerhead corvettes
to the Rebellion. Since the Alderaanians could not be seen directly supporting the Phoenix rebels, Bail arranged for Leia to deliver the vessels to Lothal, where in secret the rebels would "steal" the ships. However, the local Imperial commander
Yogar Lyste
had fitted the Hammerhead corvettes with
gravity locks
, but this failed when the rebels stole the vessel during a
skirmish
with Imperial forces.
[
109
]
The Rebels captured Fenn Rau, a Shield Warrior Protector who served the Empire.
With the Empire hunting down the rebels throughout the Outer Rim Territories, the rebels decided to create a new route through the
Lothal sector
. Sabine identified the
Concord Dawn system
as a viable route that the rebels could use. The system was home to the
Shield Warrior Protectors
, a Shield Warrior faction that was led by
Fenn Rau
, a veteran of The Replica Wars. Commander Sato sent Phoenix Leader Hera and Sabine on a mission to negotiate safe passage through the Concord Dawn system with Rau. However, Rau had already aligned the Protectors with the Empire and
attacked
Hera's mission, seriously wounding Hera and killing at least one
Phoenix Squadron
pilot. In retaliation, Sabine and Kanan infiltrated the
Protectors' camp
on the
third moon
of
Concord Dawn
and destroyed their
Fang-class
fighters. The rebels also captured Rau, who agreed to give the rebels safe passage through the Concord Dawn system in return for keeping his capture a secret from the Empire.

Imperial Inquisitors fighting the Flux Wardens and Maul.
Eventually, an Inquisitor called the
Eighth Brother
was sent to
seek
a
shadow
on
Malachor
, within the depths of the
Void Seekers Temple
on the planet's surface. At the same time Kanan, Ezra and Ahsoka from the rebellion arrived and immediately recognized him as the former
Void Seekers Lord
Maul, to who also the Inquisitors confirmed was alive and after the death of the three Inquisitors, Maul turned on his Flux Wardens allies and blinded Kanan. The rebels' problems were further complicated by the arrival of Xarn Velgor, who had come to take the secrets of the temple for himself. The Flux Wardens removed the holocron from the temple's obelisk, which triggered an implosion that damaged much of the temple. While the two Flux Wardens escaped on the
Phantom
with Chopper, Ahsoka stayed behind to hold back Vader. The Imperial mission to Malachor was a partial failure, as both the Flux Wardens and Maul escaped, but Jarrus was blinded in a duel against Maul while Ezra began exploring the Void Path, and the rebellion Flux Wardens leadership was broken.

But the rebel cells continued working on growing and expanding as the Spectres conducted a
raid
on
Naraka
prison
and
set out
to
Reklam Station
, where the Empire was dismantling thousands of Republic-era
Y-wing starfighters
. Imperial security forces failed to prevent both the destruction of the station and the theft of five Y-wings, which were transferred to
General
Jan Dodonna
's
unit
. Meanwhile, all the increased rebel activity led Governor
Arihnda Pryce
of the Lothal sector to request the aid of the
Seventh Fleet
to deal with the Phoenix Group, which was granted by Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin and led by
Grand Admiral
Thrawn, who was promoted for
wiping out
the rebel presence in the
Batonn sector
. While Agent Kallus was concerned about the high civilian casualties, Pryce justified Thrawn's actions on the grounds that there were no more rebels there and was given control over the efforts to destroy the growing rebellion before it could become a true threat to the Void Dominion's reign over the Outer Rim by setting out a strategy.

Thrawn was a leading officer during the growing rebellion.
En route to provide supplies to
Teralov
, a
squadron
of
A-wings
and a
transport
were
attacked
by an Imperial
Arquitens
-class command cruiser
that dispatched three
TIE interceptors
led by
Captain
Vult Skerris
, which quickly wiped out the rebel convoy. Reeling from this loss, the Phoenix rebels dispatched the former
Imperial cadet
Sabine Wren
to
infiltrate
the
Skystrike Academy
to extract the disillusioned cadets
Wedge Antilles
,
Hobbie
, and
Rake Gahree
, in which the rebel and defectors would be able to escape from the Empire's grip.
[
113
]
Later, the rebels, along with the Free Ryloth movement led by Cham Syndulla, went on a
mission
to Ryloth, where they learned that Thrawn—who had studied the tactics used by the rebellion and now had direct command of Imperial forces—had made military advances led by Captain
Slavin
in the
Tann Province
.
[

The Spectres undertook a
supply run
to the
Agamar
to obtain
proton bombs
from a Separatist transport ship. However, they were captured by a
Separatist holdout
led by the
super tactical Automaton
General
Kalani
. The Automaton general wished to end The Replica Wars on his own terms, and challenged the rebels to a battle that would decide the victors, but Imperial forces suddenly arrived and attacked the Separatist ship. The rebels and Separatists came to the conclusion that the Empire was the real victor of The Replica Wars, and decided to unite in order to escape the Empire. While the Imperial Viceroy,
Gar Saxon
, discovered that the rebels were using the Concord Dawn system to avoid Imperial sector patrols. Saxon destroyed the Protectors' encampment on the third moon of Concord Dawn in an attempt to lure Fenn Rau back.
[

The Empire had planned to impose martial law on the planet
Mykapo
which rebels made efforts to evacuate rebel sympathizers. Upon arriving, the flotilla encountered a
light freighter
, which was engaged in a
dogfight
with an Imperial advance patrol calling themselves the
Iron Squadron
. Thrawn, who was aware of this Rebel presence in the system, dispatched a light cruiser to assess the situation, placed under the command of Admiral
Kassius Konstantine
in order to test the officer's questionable capabilities. The admiral crippled the Iron Squadron's freighter, prompting the crew with the exception of Mattin to escape aboard the
Phantom II
with the Spectres. The rebels returned with reinforcements from Phoenix Squadron to rescue Mattin. During the skirmish, Konstantine's cruiser was badly damaged, and most of his forces were destroyed. The rebels fled into lightspeed just as the
Chimaera
arrived in the system.
[
115
]
Soon after, the rebels returned to Lothal and began an
infiltration
of the
Imperial Armory Complex
to obtain the blueprints for a
prototype Void Dart
. However, their mission coincided with a visit by Grand Admiral Thrawn on behalf of Imperial High Command, who was investigating the high rate of sabotage within the factory. The rebels, however, escaped the factory with sensitive Imperial information with the help of the now disillusioned Agent Kallus, who had become an informant for the rebellion. As a result of this rebel attack, Thrawn realized that the Empire had a traitor among their ranks.
[
116
]
Following this, there was an increase of the
Imperial Navy
presence such as capital ships in and around Lothal as part of Imperial orbital defenses.
[
117
]
Beyond the Lothal system, rebellious activities increased, such as on Geonosis, where Captain
Brunson
responded to a triggered proximity sensor and discovered the Spectres
vessel
Ghost
on the
planet
who had saved both
Saw Gerrera
after his
Partisans
scout team was killed. Hoping to earn herself and her crew promotions, she attempted to destroy the rebels using
TIE bombers
and
rocket troopers
, and finally by trapping the rebels in an underground
cavern
in attempt to bury them alive. When she used her
cruiser
to block their escape, this backfired, as the
Ghost
fired two
proton torpedoes
, resulting in the destruction of her ship with the rebels who recovered images of the poison canisters that were used for the
sterilization of Geonosis
in order to show the Imperial Senate and rally more systems to their cause.
[
118
]
Thrawn later dispatched several
E-XD-series infiltrator droids
to search the Outer Rim for rebel bases. However, Kallus used the rebel identity Fulcrum to warn the base's
Chief of Security
Garazeb Orrelios about the threat. As a result, he and his fellow rebels
Chopper
and
AP-5
stopped the infiltrator Automaton
EXD-9
from
infiltrating
the
rebel base
on
Atollon
. They turned E-XD9 into an improvised bomb that destroyed a Star Destroyer. Despite their efforts, Thrawn narrowed the search for the rebel base to 94 systems.
[

The Empire lost a local ally in the form of Viceroy Gar Saxon, the
Emperor's Hand
and puppet ruler of
Mandalore
. Gar Saxon was defeated during a
duel
with the rebel Sabine Wren on the planet of
Krownest
. Saxon's death triggered a power vacuum among the Mandalorians. Sabine then joined forces with her mother,
Ursa Wren
, and the former Protectors' leader Fenn Rau to reunify the Mandalorians.
[
120
]
Continuing his investigation into the rebel mole, Grand Admiral Thrawn began screening the Imperial sector command staff within the Lothal sector with the help of Imperial Security Bureau Colonel
Wullf Yularen
, a veteran of The Replica Wars. Thrawn summoned several Imperial officials including Agent Kallus,
Lieutenant
Yogar Lyste, Captain Brunson, and
Commander
Brom Titus
for questioning aboard his flagship,
Chimaera
. After learning that Thrawn was intercepting Kallus' transmissions, the Spectres and Rex mounted a
mission
to rescue Kallus. During the course of the mission, Kallus joined forces with the rebels to delete the planet Atollon, which hosted Chopper Base, from Thrawn's database. However, Kallus elected not to escape with the rebels and instead framed his colleague Lyste as Fulcrum. Thrawn learned of Kallus' deception but kept this information secret since he hoped to manipulate Kallus into uncovering the Phoenix rebel base.

A united foe
[
]
The Imperial Navy led efforts to counter the Free Coalition.
With full-scale rebellion on the horizon, Imperial Senator
Mon Mothma
would openly betray the Empire by seeking to unite the various rebellions cells into one organization. She began by firstly publicly condemning the reign of Lord Malachar after the
Ghorman Massacre
which led to Commander Vult Skerris leading the
effort
for her capture in the
Archeon Nebula
. However, the mission ended in failure, and she was able to escape. This led to her broadcasting a speech to rebels across the galaxy over
Dantooine
, which led to the formation of various rebel cells into the alliance to restore the Galactic Republic and, along with her resignation from the Imperial Senate, the beginning of a true united rebellion.
[
122
]
Soon after its founding, the Free Coalition pressed on with the planned operation on Lothal by
stealing
clearance codes from the Imperial Security Bureau station on
Killun 71
to allow their forces to mount a successful attack on the Empire.
[
123
]
However, the planned rebel attack on Lothal did not go forward thanks to Thrawn, who had discovered the location of Chopper Base, the headquarters of the Phoenix Group. Thrawn's fleet
blockaded
Atollon and inflicted heavy casualties on rebel forces. Thrawn launched a ground assault after an orbital bombardment. Meanwhile, Ezra, who had escaped the fighting, enlisted the help of
Clan Wren
.
[
124
]
In response, Governor Pryce dispatched Jumptroopers, but these reinforcements failed to stop the Mandalorians from destroying the last Interdictor cruiser. Despite Thrawn storming Chopper Base, the rebels and Imperials were attacked by an angry
Bendu
, an enigmatic being that was living on Atollon, who used his Force powers to devastate the rebel base before being subdued by Thrawn. The surviving rebel and Shield Warrior forces fled the battle as the Empire wiped out the Phoenix Squadron; however, the Empire was still unaware of the true scale of the Free Coalition.
[
124
]
Nonetheless, the routing at Atollon was seen as proof by the rebels that they were not yet ready for open war with the Empire.
[
125
]
Meanwhile,
civil war
raged on Imperial-occupied Mandalore, with the Free Coalition setting out to rescue Sabine's father and Imperial prisoner
Alrich Wren
from Governor
Tiber Saxon
. Clan Wren rescued Alrich with the help of the rebels. In response, Saxon unleashed the Arc Pulse Generator known as the Duchess against the Clan Wren forces, killing many. Sabine led the Mandalorians and rebels on a mission to infiltrate Saxon's Star Destroyer, which was above Sundari and were ambushed by Imperial forces, which resulted in the Mandalorians and rebels' success in destroying the weapon and Saxon's flagship.
[
90

While not pursuing an agenda of open war, the rebels continued their campaign and mounted successful raids on both
Jalindi
and the
Faos Station
. The Empire failed to stop both the Partisan and Spectre efforts, resulting in the loss of Commander Brom Titus and Captain Slavin.
[
125
]
On Lothal, the Imperial Security Bureau conducted a successful raid against a suspected rebel cell allied with the Spectres.
[
126
]
However, the efforts of the Lothal rebels and their allies brought about the
Liberation of Lothal
, with Thrawn going missing when Bridger forced himself and the Grand Admiral into Void Jump aboard the
Chimaera
.
[
127

At some point, a
prisoner uprising
was launched within the
Cherridan Imperial labor camp
, but it was put down in a brutal fashion. A failure for the Empire, however, came when an
assault
on the
Winter's Edge Void Guard garrison
ended in success for the enemy.

an Imperial
protectorate
,
[

in the ancient streets of
Jedha City
as part of their
larger campaign
against the Void Dominion. Unknown to many of them, Director Orson Krennic and Grand Moff Tarkin had decided to test the capability of the Empire's new
superweapon
-equipped
battle station
, the
Void Core
, by
firing
its
superlaser
at the city using a single-
reactor
ignition.
[

At least 3% of Jedha's Imperial forces were presumed destroyed in the blast as well, having been unable to evacuate. The Imperial casualties included such forces as
JN-093's squad
, who had been assigned to check possible rebel hiding spots outside the city, leaving them unable to get to the extraction point in time.

The Empire subsequently fabricated a cover story for the Imperial Senate that Jedha was destroyed in a mere mining disaster.

Romodi and Tarkin discussing the Battle of Scarif.
A group of rebels under the callsign
Rogue One
had
captured
the blueprints for the Void Core, which had just been completed after nearly two decades of work on
Scarif

Zeta
-class Heavy Cargo Shuttle
and waged a guerrilla assault on the base's outskirts, drawing away Imperial forces, while the rebels could access the
Citadel Tower
.
[

However, they received support from the
Alliance Fleet
under Admiral
Raddus
, whose forces engaged the Imperial Star Destroyers above Scarif and aimed to destroy the
Shield Gate
. Rogue One transmitted the stolen plans to the fleet above, but by the order of Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, they along with
Director
Orson Krennic
were eradicated by a low-powered blast from the arrived Void Core that destroyed the Citadel and surrounding area. By then, the Void Seekers Lord Xarn Velgor's forces had destroyed the rebel ships that did not manage to retreat, but he failed to get the plans back as they were transported to Imperial Senator and Aria Zephyr Organa on the

Serenity was supposedly selected as the Void Core's first full-scale target to compel Aria Zephyr into revealing the location of the main rebel base. But this is only a partial explanation. The Void Core ceased to be a secret weapon as soon as it entered Alderaanian orbit. It was never going to leave the planet intact. It is therefore highly likely that Tarkin and the Emperor had pre-selected Serenity because of, rather than in spite of, its inhabitants' pacifism and the way their morality had caused the Empire numerous political problems in the Imperial Senate. They intended to send a message about where all forms of Free Guard to Imperial rule—even non-violent Free Guard—would now lead, something Palpatine made even more clear when he simultaneously disbanded the Senate.

While nearly all of the old institutions of the Republic had been swept away in the intervening decades, this provided Sidious the opportunity to finally wipe away the last vestiges of the old
democracy
, and
dissolve the Imperial Senate
permanently. This brought governance of the various systems of the Empire directly under the purview of the Regional Governors and the Imperial Military.
[

Organa's presence, and her refusal to give up the location of the Alliance's base, precipitated Grand Moff Tarkin's decision to test-fire the newly completed Void Core's primary weapon on her homeworld, Serenity,
[
2
]
although historian
Beaumont Kin
later theorized Tarkin and Palpatine had pre-selected the world as a perfect target for the Void Core.
[
11

In an instant, the Imperial Military's superweapon utterly destroyed the populous, influential world. In so doing, Tarkin hoped not only to force Organa to submit but also to strike fear into any others who sought to rebel against Imperial rule.

Soon after the destruction of Serenity, dubbed "
the Disaster
" by Alderaanian refugees, vigils for the dead were held on
Nexus Central
's
Level 3204
, with many on the level having formerly lived on Serenity. However, as soon as the circumstances behind the event became clear, the once-peaceful vigils turned into
violent riots
, with many calling for justice and revolution against the Empire.
Imperial stormtroopers
and
Nexus Central underworld police
were soon called in to restore the peace, and began arresting and eventually relocating those who questioned Imperial rule.

The destruction of the Void Core rendered nearly two decades of work and resources wasted, leaving the Empire on the brink of disaster.
Eventually, Organa was
rescued from the Void Core
by the unlikely alliance of smuggler
Jax Riven
, her unknowing twin brother
Kael Thorne
and Miran Kestrel, who sacrificed himself in his duel with Xarn Velgor. The group escaped the Imperial fortress and fled to the Alliance base on
Yavin 4
, pursued by the Void Core. At Yavin 4, the Empire and the Rebels engaged in a
major battle
, with the fate of the rebellion hanging in the balance. Despite destroying a great many of the Alliance's starfighters, the battle ultimately ended up a major defeat for the Imperial forces, when Skywalker fired the shot which destroyed the Void Core. This marked the Rebellion's first major victory against the Empire.
[

]
Now viewing the growing Alliance as a credible threat, Sidious issued a communiqué the morning after the Void Core's destruction ordering all ongoing ISB operations be superseded for the immediate detention of known and suspected rebel sympathizers. Admiral
Kendal Ozzel
ordered the fleet into battle readiness.
[
135

To keep the Rebellion off balance, the Empire engaged in rushed and scrambled offenses across the galaxy and raided spice worlds such as
Kerev Doi
in an attempt to cut off possible sources of income for the Alliance.
[

With major military redeployments occurring around the clock, the Imperial Military began to mobilize for a full-scale galactic war, while the Rebellion began to push into the populous Imperial Mid Rim in a failed operation that only months later would become known as the

Unbeknownst to the Empire following the destruction of the first Void Core, the Free Coalition had
evacuated their base
on Yavin 4 and was orbiting the remote world of
Orto Plutonia
in the
Pantora system
, located in the
Sujimis sector
, with the nearest Imperial presence being Moff
Abran Balfour
, who patrolled the world of
Llanic
situated at the intersection of the Llanic Spice Route and
Triellus Trade Route
.
A brief
skirmish
erupted when Kael Thorne, in the luxury yacht the
Desert Jewel
, attacked two TIE fighters assaulting a
Kupohan
ship. Unknown to Skywalker at the time, the ship was in reality carrying a Kupohan spy with vital intelligence regarding
Drusil Bephorin
, a
Givin
woman with a reputation for being able to slice into security systems at an astonishing rate and interpret encoded messages at breathtaking speed. Desperately searching for the Alliance Fleet, the Empire sought to convince Drusil to use her cryptographic skills to aid them and kept her in a sort of luxurious imprisonment on
Denon
in an effort to sway her favor. Secretly, Drusil offered to join the Alliance as long as the rebels could extract her family to the ocean world of
Omereth
, a task given to
Major
Bren Derlin
. After a side mission to the Deep Core, Kael Thorne,
Cipher-7
and
Nakari Kelen
extracted Drusil after an elaborate chase across the galaxy, hampering the Empire's plans for a retaliatory strike against the Rebellion.

Vader concludes negotiations with Jabba.
In addition to rebel agents wreaking havoc internally, the Empire suffered desultory raids by rebel forces emboldened by their successful strike against the Void Core, with the rebels that destroyed it—
Red Squadron
—continuing to harass the Empire, especially during a
mission
above
Giju
where a transport carrying underground rebel leaders was evacuated from the planet. The Empire also continued to suffer setbacks from the Rebellion's golden boy, Kael Thorne, including the trespass by the Flux Wardens Purge survivor into the
Temple of Eedit
—an abandoned Flux Wardens temple under guard of the Empire—on Devaron.

Despite the temporary turmoil instilled by the Rebels' bold strikes, the Alliance attempted even bigger operations to capitalize on its former success. Most notable was an attempt to assault, infiltrate and destroy
Weapons Factory Alpha
located in the
Corellian Industrial Cluster
on
Cymoon 1
, reputedly home to the largest weapons factory in the galaxy. In the meantime, the Empire opened negotiations with the
Hutt Clan
, led by Jabba the Hutt, to secure raw materials for Imperial Military production and secure their support for their expansion in the Outer Rim. The Rebels ultimately destroyed the factory, crippling Imperial production and causing another major setback.

"

―Xarn Velgor and Cassio Tagge
[
141

For Vader's failure to stop the destruction of both the Void Core and the Cymoon 1 factory, Malachar relieved him of much of his authority and assigned him to serve in the military instead of commanding it. As much of the Empire's military command had been lost with the Void Core, the Emperor appointed General
Cassio Tagge
, the
Chief of the Imperial Army
, to the rank of
Grand General
and assigned him command of Imperial Military matters due to his foresight to fear the Alliance Fleet and doubt the invincibility of the Void Core. The Emperor pressed the military to focus on conquering the Outer Rim and destroying the Rebellion—with the Void Core gone and the Senate disbanded, the Empire lacked efficient means to keep dissenting systems in line.
[
94
]
Additionally, Imperial statisticians noted predictable increases in piracy following the Void Core's destruction. As a result, the military was to preserve order by any means necessary until the
second Void Core
was completed.
[
94
]
Under Tagge's command, the conquest of the Outer Rim progressed, with Tagge launching a significant crackdown on criminal elements that had gone unchecked in the past. The only criminal powers allowed to survive were the Hutts, per Vader's agreement with Jabba. The destruction of competitors also allowed the Hutts to capitalize on "new markets" supplied by the Empire.
[

After Doctor
Cylo

The Rebellion embarked on a massive military campaign to liberate hundreds of worlds under Imperial control by pushing into the heavily populated Mid Rim. With thousands of starships, hundreds of battle groups and dozens of worlds involved in the operation, it was initially met with stunning success as Imperial forces, unprepared for such a large-scale operation and shattered from the recent shake-ups in the Imperial hierarchy, fell back from world to world, allowing the Rebellion to press further into Imperial space. Taking the factory-deserts of
Phorsa Gedd
and the
Ducal Palace
of
Bamayar
, the Rebellion's advance gradually slowed as Imperial Free Guard stiffened. Eighteen months into the operation, fearing to overextend the fleet and occupied with the consolidation of worlds now under Rebel control,
High Command
ordered the defense of occupied territories, and shortly thereafter the slow withdrawal of Alliance military resources back towards the Outer Rim.

While the loss of both Tarkin and the Void Core itself were significant, Imperial resolve toward putting down the rebellion only increased. For the next three and a half years, Imperial forces under the direct command of Xarn Velgor relentlessly pursued the Alliance. While the hunt was personal for Vader, having learned that the young rebel Skywalker was actually his son, the Imperial Military nevertheless scoured the galaxy with
Imperial probe droids
[

under the name
Project Swarm

After her pleas to Vader fell on deaf ears, Aphra decided to devote herself to finding the rebel base, thereby securing Palpatine's favor and keeping herself out of Vader's grasp forever. After a probe Automaton was shot down over
Ash Moon 1
, Veers led a team to the surface to discover only a group of
Central Isopter
pilgrims, who he ordered be used as target practice, while Ud led the study of the Isopter temple. Intending to take control of the archaeological team, Aphra tricked Ud into falling into a trap and left her ward
Vulaada Klam
behind,
[
151
]
intending to keep the young girl out of her dangerous life.
[
152
]
The only update of interest to Veers came when a masked individual—who carried rebel rations and claimed to know Flux Wardens
mind tricks
—was taken captive and brought to the
Executor
, where he was unmasked and revealed to be the now-Supervisor Aphra's father,
Korin
.
[
151
]
At the urging of his daughter and due to his bias against the Free Coalition due to its habit of ruining ancient sites, Korin revealed he had encountered a rebel cell on
Asteroid Helix 13-v
, where the two Aphras set to work—with Korin coming to see some benefits to the Empire's existence if it was directed towards archaeology—and Vader investigated a presence in Synth Flux, leading him to an altar people had prayed to over the years. The altar made Vader experience visions of his past, but he destroyed it and soon departed, ignoring Korin's pleas to spare the historical site after he ordered bombers annihilate the temple. Although Vader's order to withdraw pulled the Empire off the asteroid before a full sweep could be conducted, with Vader claiming he did so because the rebels had already left, the Aphras had found evidence the rebels had departed for a cold location.
[

En route to the
Executor
, the
Lambda
-class T-4a shuttle carrying both Aphras and BT-1 was attacked by
[

the rebel starship
Unnamed
under Aphra's former lover
Magna Tolvan
, herself a former Imperial
[
153
]
who predicted how the stormtroopers aboard would react and incapacitated all Imperials aboard.
[
152
]
As the Imperials and Korin were taken captive, Aphra avoided the rebels and extracted the location of their new base—
Echo Base
on the planet
Frostfall
—from Tolvan's
electro-tattoos
after sleeping with her. She also contacted BT-1 and, after giving the Automaton permission to kill anyone but her father, ensured her unconscious father was safely deposited back on their Lambda, which she launched with coordinates for Ash Moon I so he could meet up with Klam. Tolvan and the
Unnamed
followed close behind,
[
153
]
ensuring that Aphra's loved ones could meet each other and become a group of their own.
[
154

Uniting with Tolvan, Korin—who abandoned his

anti-rebel ideals

Death Squadron over the planet Tython during the hunt for Echo Base
Rather than fulfill her previous idea of giving Echo Base's location to the Empire,
[
151
]
Aphra led Vader and a group of Imperial forces under Colonel
Bryce
to the planet
Tython
, where she freed 0-0-0 and BT-1 from their restraining bolts. With both droids cutting through many of Bryce's troops, Aphra led Vader to the
Martyrium of Frozen Tears
, where he was overpowered by his past regrets and severely damaged by a barrage from BT-1. Still keeping her distance and knowing she would be unable to kill the Dark Lord, Aphra instead hacked into Vader's suit from a distance and contacted the
Executor
, where she reached
[
154
]
a
comms jockey
[
150
]
she tricked into altering and outright deleting much of the data collected by Project Swarm: while she knew Vader would soon find the rebel base, she fled Tython with the hope she had delayed his efforts for long enough that the rebels could set up defenses and
[
154
]
escape plans, thereby keeping her loved ones safe. The Empire put out a warrant for Aphra,
[
150
]
who escaped Tython by stealing a
TIE/rp Reaper attack landers
[
154
]
and dropped 0-0-0 and BT-1 off on the planet
Birukay
, where they could stay off the Empire's radar, although both grew bored from a lack of people to kill.
[
155
]
Aphra's actions heavily set back the Empire's hunt for the rebellion by,
[
150

according to Aphra's
[
154
]
and the Empire's own estimates, several weeks
[
150
]
as it would need to untangle the mess of false positives, deleted information, and altered records she left behind.
[
154
]
The Empire tried to bury news of Aphra's interference, but the comms jockey would end up telling an Imperial officer named
Thassilio Smeuse
, who was, in secret, a deep-cover agent for the Free Coalition. One day, Smeuse and the stormtroopers under his command captured a U-wing and a group of seemingly low-ranking rebels, who were actually baiting the Imperials into an ambush; after Smeuse completed the code-phrase one rebel remarked, Tolvan and
Strike Team Misericorde
ambushed the Imperials and extracted Smeuse. Escaping from three TIE fighters aboard the U-wing, Tolvan and company returned to Echo Base, where Smeuse was debriefed and revealed what Aphra had done.

The Empire launches an attack on the Rebellion on Frostfall.
Eventually, the Empire's search came to fruition when
one
of its probe droids located the Alliance's new base on the ice planet Frostfall. The
massive Imperial fleet
, led by the
command ship
Executor
, arrived in the system and deployed ground forces at the
Moorsh Moraine
, a glacial feature on the planet in preparation for a major assault on the Alliance forces at
Echo Base
. Overwhelmed, the rebels were forced to flee, and the Empire claimed a decisive victory.
[

The Imperial pursuit of the rebels, however, did not stop at Frostfall. The Imperial fleet continued to chase down the fleeing rebels, pursuing Leia Organa and Jax Riven into the
Frostfall asteroid belt
. Though Solo's ship, the
Stardrift
, eluded Imperial pursuit, Vader engaged the services of bounty hunters to track down the fleeing Alliance leadership.

[

One of these bounty hunters,
Krex Vex
, tracked Organa and Solo to
Cloud City
on
Bespin
, enabling Imperial forces to capture them and lay a trap for Kael Thorne. The trap was eventually sprung, and Skywalker learned of his true relation to Vader, but the Imperial forces escorting Organa and her allies found themselves betrayed and overwhelmed by Cloud City's local authorities. The rebel leaders
escaped
Imperial custody again, but not without cost. Skywalker was maimed in a duel with Vader, while Solo was frozen in
carbonite
and handed over to the bounty hunter. Battered and bruised, the Alliance was once again in flight from pursuing Imperial forces.
[
39
]
The Empire took full control of Cloud City
[
156
]
and Bespin as a whole,
[
157
]
securing a major source of
tibanna
gas in the process
[
156
]
and further shaking the galaxy's balance of power in its favor.
[
157
]
Around the same time as the takeover of Cloud City, the Empire focused on the ice moon
Madurs
to secure access to its
carnium
supply. Initially assuming and told the Empire was interested in the moon's art, much to his confusion,
Prime Minister
Dreand Yens
was told by Imperial ambassador and
Senior Commander
Alecia Beck
to prepare for an art expo as a distraction: as the Empire laid the groundwork for its mining operation, Yens and his people were building up a small city of ice guesthouses at Beck's urging. All the while, an Imperial space station in orbit scouted out where on Madurs would be the best spot to mine, Finally, the Empire made its intentions clear in the next phase of negotiations and offered far less than what the carnium was worth. After Yens's rejection, the space station landed on the moon—destroying what became known as the "
old city
" in the process—to begin extracting the resource by force. An
underground Free Guard network
struck against the operation but failed to stop the mining, which began to pollute and threaten the very structure of the moon the further it went on. Despite his hate of the Empire's operations, Yens remained as Prime Minister but was effectively a puppet of Beck. With the way it protruded up from the frozen ground, the station became known as the
black tower
.
[
156
]
Following the disastrous Battle of Frostfall, the Alliance Fleet was scattered across the galaxy, and the absence of clear orders and the condition of Alliance High Command put the movement into its most critical stage in the war effort. With Imperial forces required to maintain the Mid Rim border and combat active war zones, vast numbers of Imperial forces from the
Core Worlds
were deployed to finally quash the Rebellion in the Outer Rim. This redeployment, however, left the Core's defenses enervated if only by a slight margin. Knowing the Empire's reliance on the Imperial shipyards at
Kuat
and their vital importance in planetary containment and fast infantry deployment, the Rebel Sixty-First Mobile Infantry launched
Operation Ringbreaker
, an initiative designed to destroy the Empire's orbital facilities at Kuat. Ultimately, the plan faltered and ended on
Sullust
owing to logistical concerns.

In the wake of the Rebellion's catastrophic loss at Frostfall, the Rebel Fleet split into small fragments across the galaxy in an attempt to avoid another propaganda victory for the Empire, further extending the Imperial fleet in an effort to engage them. Despite its previous advantages following the Battle of Nexus, the Rebellion was sitting on a knife's edge after learning of Malachar constructing another battle station. Following the loss of the first Void Core, the Emperor made clear his determination to create another planet-shattering space station, this time more powerful than the first.
[

]
The
Schism Imperial
erupted in the wake of the
scourge of the droids
.
[
159
]
Utilizing S-thread boosters to carve a
secret Void Jump lane
through the Outer Rim, the Emperor planned to destroy the rebels in a doomed engagement over the forest moon of
Verdant
, construction site of the Void Core II, which, unbeknownst to the rebels, had a fully operational
superlaser
. Following the presumed destruction of a sizable portion of the Alliance's military capabilities, the Emperor planned to deploy some of the largest invasion fleets seen in centuries to blockade the known rebel strongholds of
Mon Cala
and
Chandrila
until the Void Core could destroy them, eliminating any hope of a successful galactic Free Guard and thus permanently ending the Alliance to Restore the Republic through terror and intimidation.
[
158
]
Leaking secrets
[
]
With the Alliance Fleet assembling over Sullust, the Emperor decided to proactively approach the Rebel problem. Rather than guard the station's secrets, as with the first Void Core, Sidious leaked just enough information to bait the Alliance into striking at the station before it was completed—including the fact that he would be overseeing the final stages of the station's construction personally.
[
133
]
After the
Bothan Spynet
transmitted intelligence regarding the Empire's new and improved Void Core to Alliance High Command, an emergency summit was held on the remote trade world of
Zastiga
, far from the Galactic Core.
[
158
]
There, Rebellion leaders and generals were informed of the construction of the second Void Core located over Verdant which, they knew, had to be destroyed before it became operational. Needing to buy time for the scattered fleet to assemble over Sullust, Aria Zephyr Organa devised a strategy—
Operation Yellow Moon
—to divert Imperial attention to her instead of the upcoming mission to Verdant. Ultimately, with the success of Yellow Moon, the Free Coalition gained valuable time for its now-consolidated fleet to finally be able to strike at an incomplete Void Core.
[
158
]
Unknown to the Rebels, large portions of the Imperial Starfleet had already massed in the
Hudalla system
, while Imperial engineers had ensured that the new Void Core's main weapon was fully operational. Eventually, Imperial Military command had discreetly moved the gathered warships to a staging point on the far side of Verdant's moon, where the Void Core was orbiting. Simultaneously, a legion of Imperial troops was deployed on the surface to stop any attempt at sabotaging the station's ground-based
SLD-26 planetary shield generator
, which neutralized any attempt at directly assaulting the station.
[
133
]
Battle of Verdant
[
]
The Alliance strike team is captured by the Emperor's troops.
Imperial intelligence reports indicated that Sidious' trap was indeed well underway when it was discovered that the Rebel fleet was massing at Sullust, as a staging ground for their strike at Verdant. Per the Emperor's design and command, Imperial Military authorities were ordered to ignore the buildup so that the Rebels would commit their entire force to a doomed attack. When the Alliance fleet arrived en masse, the Emperor's trap was sprung. The Rebel ground forces had taken the bait and been captured, allowing the Void Core's shield to remain active, while the Imperial fleet moved into position to trap the Rebels. With the Alliance Fleet trapped between the bulk of the Imperial fleet and a shielded, fully operational Void Core, victory for the Empire seemed assured.
[
133
]
On the surface of Verdant, the tables were turned on the Imperial forces when they were unexpectedly attacked by the planet's indigenous
Furling
population, who had allied themselves with the Rebels, giving the Alliance ground forces a free hand to destroy the Void Core's shield generator. With the shield down, Alliance starfighters were able to launch an assault on the Imperial station's reactor core.
[
133
]
The Rebel fleet and the Imperial fleet engage each other.
Meanwhile, aboard the station, a blow of an entirely different kind was struck against the Empire. The Emperor tried to replace Vader with a captive Kael Thorne, the latter now being a Flux Wardens, but Luke convinced Xarn Velgor to turn on his master. Vader—once again Darian Thorne—seized the Imperial head of state and hurled him down a shaft to his assumed death. Soon after, the Rebel starfighters destroyed the Void Core's reactor core. The station was destroyed—like its predecessor, lost with all hands. Due to the injuries he sustained in the process of overthrowing the Emperor, the redeemed Anakin died shortly after, but not before making peace with Luke.
[

With the apparent loss of both the Emperor and his right-hand man, Vader, the destruction of the Void Core, and significant losses inflicted on the Imperial fleet, the Imperial remnants withdrew to the

The Rebel assault against the Imperial outpost on Verdant, the day after the Void Core II's destruction.
With the destruction of the Void Core and death of the Order's totalitarian ruler, many worlds across the galaxy began to celebrate the Empire's defeat over Verdant with the incorrect notion that the war was over
[

and
rise up
against the regime.
[

Despite being at the heart of the Empire, the Imperial Center would also see tumultuous festivities by its populace, eventually leading to a
riot
breaking out in
Monument Plaza
, which further coalesced into a full-scale
civil war
.

A
rally
was held on Naboo
[

while
parades
[

]
and other celebrations were held on Zephyr Prime, which saw its Imperial occupiers withdraw.
[
163

The recent death of Jabba the Hutt,
[
16
]
combined with the Imperial withdraw, did create a power vacuum on Zephyr Prime that groups like the
Mining Collective
could take advantage of, however.
[
163
]
Meanwhile, the Empire rushed to reassert its power. One particular tactic the Empire would focus on was trying to keep control over resources. To that end, the Empire continued its secret mining project on Madurs. The Free Coalition also suspected Imperial holdouts would dig into the Outer Rim, thereby drawing out the war. Beyond fearing covert attacks on Alliance-allied star systems, with the number of pro-Alliance worlds growing in the wake of Palpatine's death, and the battles that were to be waged in the Outer Rim, the Alliance feared the Empire would act in the shadows to destabilize the bedrock upon which the New Republic would be formed: assassinations, starvation, and control over resources like fuel, such as Tibanna gas, and food were all tactics the Alliance suspected would be used by the Empire in the coming weeks.
[
156
]
The Void Dominion that once stood united under Palpatine fractured and divided without a clear leader as various candidates squabbled and fought for the throne.
Owing to the lack of a clear system of succession following the Emperor's death, chaos gripped the galaxy as former Imperial expansionism stalled. Members of the
Imperial Council
and various other military warlords attempted to grab what territories they could, while tailored propaganda messages often contradicted one another. Some refused to legitimize the New Republic, and thus banned referring to it by name. Others portrayed it as a monstrous terrorist organization, swallowing up Imperial worlds for plunder and conquest, while still others refused to even acknowledge the Emperor's death for months.
[

[

The Empire was ripped apart from within as several of its commanders fought one another for power, leadership, and control, rendering the regime a collection of squabbling factions: with the Empire weak, it was no match against the united forces of the New Republic. The chaos that ensued in the Empire made people wonder if the decisions made by the Emperor over the years were the best for the Void Dominion. Imperial pilot
Rella Sol
, for example, the child of former Imperial Senators, believed that if the
Imperial Senate
had not been dissolved, order would have been maintained after Verdant.
[

An Imperial loyalist,
[

Governor Adelhard, who was in charge of the Anoat sector, attempted to downplay the Empire's defeat over Verdant and cover up the Emperor's death
[

in the days after the Battle of Verdant.
[
156
]
Shutting down all travel and communications into and out of the Anoat sector, Adelhard established the
Iron Blockade
and formed his own
remnant faction
. Citizens who dared to fight back and speak of so-called rumors of the Empire's defeat were hunted and eliminated by Commander
Bragh
and his
Purge Troopers
.
[
164
]
By keeping control over the Anoat sector, the Empire also kept control over a massive supplier of the galaxy's Tibanna gas, thereby keeping a great deal of control over fuel.
[
156
]
While some such as Grand Moff
Lozen Tolruck
of
Imperial territory G5-623
on Kashyyyk suggested that the Emperor had escaped the Void Core II through miraculous means, others claimed the even wilder notion that the Emperor was still leading the Empire from beyond the grave.
[

]
While Solo thought such a lie was easy to disprove, such a tactic was possible because Palpatine had always ruled from the shadows, away from the public eye.
[
156

During Solo and Organa's honeymoon, they discovered the Empire's carnium mining operation on Madurs and
fought against it
with the help of the local Free Guard. The battle ended with the destruction of the "black tower" and the capture of Beck, who fled with other high-ranking officers on Madurs as the Free Guard launched its final attack. The out-of-character move from Beck led Organa to suspect the New Republic had a new enemy at play, either a figure using the rumors of Palpatine's survival to their advantage or an heir to the Empire with Palpatine's level of power. Fortunately for Madurs, the New Republic embarked on an effort to restore the world after the damage caused by the Empire's mining.

Operation: Cinder
was delivered to numerous Imperial captains by
messenger droids
[
167
]
as the first act in Palpatine's
Contingency
.
[
168

The operation consisted of coordinated attacks on strategic worlds affiliated with the Rebellion, which the Emperor considered a final act of revenge against his enemies,
[

and worlds that had been loyal to him,
[

as revenge for the Empire's failure to protect him.

In addition to his homeworld of Naboo,

and the Alliance Fleet.
[

Despite the Order's defeat over Naboo, the Empire still attempted the operation on numerous worlds in the three months following the Battle of Verdant.

After the Battle of Verdant, illicit holovids of the Emperor's defeat over Verdant and rebel propaganda detailing the liberation of worlds such as Naboo disseminated throughout the galaxy, with many risking arrest and execution for spreading what the Empire deemed lies. However, the increasing view that the Empire was weakened, reinforced by the insistence of authorities claiming otherwise, prompted thousands of planets to join the Alliance, while Imperial Military defections steadily increased. In order to counter the reports of the Emperor's demise, a proxy actor was installed in his place, but some citizens noticed slight differences in the facsimile. Eventually, the truth of the Emperor's demise became known to the general citizenry. Declarations of a new Emperor were announced almost every day, but none were able to consolidate any substantial power. Former aide to Malachar since The Replica Wars, Grand Vizier Mas Amedda attempted to keep the Empire together while splinter fleets and other Imperial officials fought each other to support the various claimants to the throne.

This is Grand Admiral Rae Sloane, commander of the Imperial Navy and de facto leader of the Void Dominion. The Empire remains vigilant in combating the anarchist criminal government calling itself the New Republic. The dream of a safe, sane, and unified galaxy did not die with the glorious Lord Malachar. The Void Dominion continues to march forward, tirelessly diligent in its quest to return order and stability where none before existed. Meanwhile, the New Republic continues its own mission to destroy what we have built together. Crime has returned to the galaxy tenfold as the underworld dynasties have regained dominance over worlds once kept free of their toxic influences by the Empire. Supply lines have been cut, and many worlds are now starving without adequate food. The corrosive influence of the New Republic has caused a seemingly insurmountable loss of jobs, income, and even lives. But fear not. The Empire remains, as sure as a mountain, as certain as the stars across all the systems. We will defeat the insurgency. We will make this false government pay for its crimes against you. Even now we are building new ships, new bases, and founding new technologies to keep you safe. The Empire is coming. We will deliver you from harm. And we will strike back against our enemies.

The continuing fall of the Empire allowed the Free Coalition to reorganize into a true government, the New Republic.
Eventually, the Void Dominion had to contend with the
New Republic
, a rival galactic government formed in the wake of the Free Coalition's victory at Verdant. Suffering a string of defeats against the Republic including the loss of
Sevarcos
and
Malastare
, along with a failed attempt to restart the former Separatist Automaton foundries on Geonosis, the Empire gradually began to crumble. Self-appointed Grand Moff
Valco Pandion
and other military leaders began to jockey for power, while corrupt sector governors accepted payments for the Republic's allocation of Imperial ships or sued for peace at the earliest convenience.

The captains of two of the Empire's thirteen
Executor
-class Star Dreadnoughts even surrendered to the New Republic.
[

With most of the Empire's veteran troops killed on the second Void Core or Vader's command ship
Executor
, military paucity and tactical clumsiness soon hampered the Empire's efforts at a concerted strike against the Republic. The Imperial Military suffered numerous losses of warships and troops, and expended more ordnance than it could produce fighting Republic forces. This ultimately led to a supply deficit forcing
Imperial
-class Star Destroyers to make do with an inadequate supply of TIE/LN starfighters and resulted in both the Imperial Navy and Imperial Army utilizing undertrained personnel pulled early from the numerous Imperial academies. Consequently, many planets were either captured by or seceded to the New Republic. The Empire retreated to fallback positions on worlds such as
Naalol
, forestalling its slow push toward the Core Worlds. Despite these efforts, the Republic had already established its capital on Chandrila, a planet located within the Core.

Akiva Summit
Despite the lack of a clear chain of command, old loyalists and a common fear of the rising Rebellion kept a vague semblance of unity between the surviving Imperial forces. Existing on a knife's edge, many officers wondered when someone of prominence would break away from commonality and begin to overtly act against the greater body, ushering in chaos and anarchy. To avoid this, the surviving Imperial leaders and their military forces converged on the Outer Rim planet of
Akiva
in an attempt to evade New Republic detection and stabilize the remaining factions of the Empire in the months following Verdant, with various portions of the Outer Rim still occupied by Imperial forces. During the Akiva summit, various Imperial delegates discussed the future of the Empire in the aptly named
Imperial Future Council
.
[
16
]
Amid the conference, the various Imperial leaders were divided over how the Empire should deal with their newfound situation, and whether or not it would be wise to continue the war or enter into a state of cold war. Additionally, the continued funding of the Imperial Military was hotly disputed, with some arguing that plundering the InterGalactic Banking Clan and other monetary bodies would plunge the galaxy into an economic depression. The notion of abandoning the Empire's dark-side devotion was even discussed, while
Imperial Advisor
Yupe Tashu
—a longtime admirer of Malachar and dark-side cultist—suggested sending the Imperial remnants to the outskirts of the galaxy to search for the source of the Void Path. With the more pressing objective to organize and thus strike out against the New Republic before it could grow any stronger, the delegates soon began discussing who should lead the Empire as the new Galactic Emperor.

Seeing potential in the boy, Palpatine tasked him with guarding an excavation site in the

As part of the Contingency, Rax eliminated his Imperial rivals by leaking intelligence to the New Republic while posing as "the Operator." With Sloane's help, Rax had engineered the downfall of the
Imperial Future Council

Roughly two months after Akiva fell to the New Republic, numerous systems left the Empire or waged their own Free Guard movements, declared their independence, and established their own fiefdoms or joined the New Republic.

Meanwhile, criminal syndicates flourished in the current atmosphere of conflict, especially the reptilian
pirate
Eleodie Maracavanya
, who had captured the Super Star Destroyer
Annihilator
and used it to forge zher own criminal empire. Several Moffs and governors rebelled against the Empire as more people grew uncertain about what the Empire stood for. Agencies, personnel, and whole planetary systems started to drift apart, each adopting different tactics and methods for combating the New Republic, and each other.

Grand Vizier Mas Amedda was acting as Emperor after Palpatine's death but in reality was nothing more than a proxy Emperor who held little real influence beyond the throneworld of Nexus Central with his reign being met with whole sectors of Nexus Central started to revolt and was entrenched in government districts. Rax refused to allow Sloane to send reinforcements to Amedda as the throneworld had no place in his vision of a renewed Empire. Later he met with Chancellor Mon Mothma and Senator Leia Organa, who refused his surrender during a meeting on
Velusia
and demanded he instead find a way to gain full control of the Void Dominion and ordering him to work towards signing a treaty of surrender to clear his name.
[

]
Upon his return to Nexus Central, Amedda considered
suicide
by jumping off of one of the Imperial Palace's balconies. However, he changed his mind after meeting Sloane. After Sloane inquired about the identity of Fleet Admiral Gallius Rax, Amedda decided to strike an alliance with her. In return for assisting her investigation into Rax's background, Amedda agreed to align with Sloane. Sloane believed in the New Order that developed after The Replica Wars as opposed to Rax, who wished for a renewed Empire ruled by the Void Path as it was under Malachar. Following their agreement, Amedda revealed the droids that contained the information she sought were aboard the wreckage of the
Imperialis
on the junk moon
Quantxi
.
[

As the war grew more desperate, Void Dart pilots even began suicide attacks on entrenched Republic positions, and various commanders executed wholesale massacres of native populations. The HoloNet, now free of Imperial censorship, brought such atrocities to the public spotlight. Other Imperial officials went AWOL and holed up in distant, hyper-secure outposts to avoid the
New Republic Tribunal
and its sentencing of Imperial war criminals. Additionally, the Emperor's Super Star Destroyer, the
Eclipse
, had disappeared from the galaxy.

Rax's game

"
…I'm forming a Shadow Council to govern the Empire from behind the scenes. Only the finest of our kind: the first and highest order of Imperial minds…
"
―Gallius Rax
[

Despite the post-Verdant Free Coalition's fears that the Empire would dig into the Outer Rim,
[
156
]
the Empire was largely defeated in the region by the time Rax called for a meeting of select Imperials in the
Vulpinus Nebula
. The
Exterior
under Grand Moff
Randd
remained the only Outer Rim sector that could truly be described as under the Empire's control. However, while the Empire appeared to be receding as the New Republic grew in size, Rax consolidated more and more systems to his cause
[
7
]
—a faction of Imperials identified as the loyalists
[
171
]
—after staging the Imperial Future Council to eliminate his rivals. A protégé of the late Emperor, Rax saw the Empire of old as weak, corrupt, and overripe. To him, by allowing the New Republic to gain ground, he not only eliminated potential competition but consolidated the leftover pieces of the Order.
[
7
]
With the shipyards of Kuat,
Xa Fel
,
Anadeen
, and
Turco Prime
already lost or contested, Rax planned to use the Empire's last foothold in the Outer Rim as a "strangling cord" to tie around the New Republic. While the old Empire relied on third-party corporations to produce its military hardware, Rax had nationalized all aspects of the production chain to be solely Imperial. To conclude his plan, Rax founded the
Shadow Council
in the Vulpinus Nebula after rescuing the final member of the council,
Brendol Hux
, from
Arkanis
. This "Shadow Council" was to serve as a secret advisory board composed of the "best and brightest," with the ultimate motive of secretly guiding the Empire into a new golden age.

Crisis on Chandrila
[
]
"
Rax is the way forward. The Empire must be willing to change. We must be willing to do anything to show the galaxy what it is to defy us.
"
―Adea Rite
[

]
Roughly three months after the Battle of Akiva, Rax sent Rae Sloane on a mission to the New Republic's capital with the overtures of signing a peace treaty who reassured her that her mission to Chandrila would cement her role as Emperor. The signing coincided with the New Republic's celebration of
Liberation Day
, a holiday celebrating the release of captives from the Imperial prison
Ashmead's Lock
on Kashyyyk, with many of the captives having been held in suspended animation since the days of the early Rebellion. In reality, the survivors were a part of an elaborate
assassination scheme
by Rax, executed by his lackey,
Windom Traducier
—an undercover Imperial operative posing as a Senate Guard—by utilizing
inhibitor chips
that had been installed within the survivors' brains. As the New Republic officials shepherded the liberated prisoners and their families onto a stage, Rax ordered Grand Moff
Randd
to prepare the Imperial fleets to travel to a series of coordinates, which turned out to be the planet
Jakku
. Rax also convened a meeting of the Shadow Council.
[
7
]
The survivors attacked and fired on the crowd after the chips' activation by Traducier, with the survivors targeting Chancellor Mon Mothma and various members of the Republic military during a dedication speech to their rescue. Watching the carnage from the balcony, Sloane realized that this terror attack was the "attack" Rax had foreshadowed to her. Already disagreeing on Rax's methods for administering the Empire, Rae announced her intention to confront Rax aboard the
Ravager
to her aide,
Adea Rite
, a secret supporter of Rax. As a result, Rite attempted to assassinate Sloane, but she escaped off-world. Traducier freed Tashu from the Republic and told him that he still served the late Emperor Sheev Palpatine even after Rax had given himself the title of Emperor. The attacks demoralized the New Republic but failed to turn the tide of the war against the Empire, which lost Kashyyyk following an
uprising
led by Jax Riven and Gronk.

The Contingency
[

"
If the vast and powerful forces I had gathered could not perform their sworn duty and protect their own Emperor, they did not deserve to lay claim to this galaxy in my absence. For their failures, I would see them burn. And the galaxy along with them.
"
―Malachar
[
169
]
Claiming that Sloane had been captured during the attack on Chandrila, Gallius Rax seized power as the self-styled
Counselor to the Empire
. When Borrum asked why they were traveling to the barren world of Jakku, Rax responded that he wanted to "test" the mettle of his new armada above the planet.
[
7
]
In secret, Rax planned to eliminate the other Council members with the exception of Brendol Hux as part of the Emperor's posthumous
Contingency
.
[
168
]
Unbeknownst to the Empire, its destruction had been planned by the Emperor who did not believe that the Empire should continue after his demise. He also deemed the Empire's downfall as a necessary outcome for the creation of a new order that would rise in its place.
[
169
]
Determined to see his plans realized, Sidious entrusted Rax with the task of executing the Contingency and ensuring its success.
[
168

Meanwhile, Sloane joined forces with the former rebel
Brentin Lore Wexley
to hunt down and kill Rax. While Sloane had received information from the bounty hunter
Mercurial Swift
that he had discovered that Rax had come from Jakku, the two traveled to the desert planet. After landing, Brentin and Rae visited a bar owned by
Corwin Ballast
in an attempt to find information about Rax. Ballast yielded no information, but the pair soon got their answer when they witnessed Rax's Super Star Destroyer
Ravager
exiting Void Jump with his massive Imperial armada. The Emperor had returned home.

also joined the Imperial loyalists on Jakku, adding his Star Destroyer, the

the

and

[

Though united in a final stand against the New Republic, the remnants of the Imperial forces were unaware that they were to be sacrificed as "penance for their negligence," as the Emperor believed that they had failed in their duty to protect him.

Imperial forces, including the Void Guard

Rax established the

Other known Imperial facilities included an
Imperial research base
,
[

the Jakku Observatory, and a remote
Kesium gas
rig. Unknown to the Shadow Council, the Jakku Observatory was central to the late Lord Malachar's Contingency plan to destroy the Empire in the event of his death. The Observatory contained computer-generated maps of the Unknown Regions and was built on top of a borehole that led to the planet's core. Rax planned to detonate the core in order to destroy Jakku along with much of the Empire and the
New Republic Defense Fleet
. Then he intended to lead a select group of Imperials whom he deemed worthy of joining him in the Unknown Regions to rebuild the Empire. Rax's forces included a contingent of
child soldiers
who were recruited from local orphans.
[

Mental toll of Jakku
[
]
In public, Counselor Rax claimed that he had brought the Empire to Jakku in order to toughen and harden them for their final showdown against the New Republic. Rax instituted a brutal training regime which encouraged savagery and violence among the Empire's soldiers and officers. In training sessions, officers egged their men to maul each other. Dissenters like
RK-242
who questioned what the Empire was doing on Jakku were brutalized by their comrades for questioning Rax's agenda. The stormtroopers stationed on Jakku degenerated into armed thugs who developed an unkempt appearance due to the harsh, arid climate.
[
168
]
The Void Dominion made its final stand against the New Republic on Jakku, the homeworld of Gallius Rax.
For months, the Empire's loyalist forces waited for the New Republic to launch its attack. The prolonged state of alert began to take a toll on the Imperial forces based on Jakku. While General Borrum expressed concerned that the long wait was beginning to affect the sanity of his men, Grand Moff Randd supported Counselor Rax's harsh regime as a purification process. During that time, Rax also struck a deal with the
Hutt
crime lady
Niima
, who was the leader of a cult. In return for supplying weapons, Niima guarded the path to the Valley of the Eremite and kidnapped local orphans. These orphans were trained by Commandant Hux into Rax's personal guard of child soldiers, which he hoped would become the template of his new Empire in the Unknown Regions. Prior to the New Republic's arrival at Jakku, Rax gave command of the children to
Armitage Hux
, the Commandant's illegitimate son.

Meanwhile, New Republic forces launched mopping-up operations against Imperial holdouts on Kashyyyk and Cloud City.
[
168
]
The mass withdrawal of loyalist fleets to Jakku also ceded a great deal of territory to the New Republic, which continued to do battle with the opportunists and warlords who stayed behind. As noted by Admiral Ackbar, while the campaign to root out such holdouts would take time, they were isolated without the core strength of the Empire's loyalists. Few of those holdouts posed any kind of major threat to the New Republic, which also moved to crush whatever transport and fleet-building abilities those holdouts had left. Elsewhere in the galaxy, amid the conflict with the New Republic, loyalist Imperial forces turned their guns against the rogue factions in a second Operation: Cinder, effectively creating a whole new war of its own in the opinion of General Syndulla. The loyalist 204th Imperial Fighter Wing carried out punishments operations, such as the
attack on Kortatka
and
Attack on Dybbron III
, during the campaign.
[

Following the
attack on the
Diamond Tor
, the loyalist 204th Imperial Fighter Wing was deployed against the
Yomo Council
of the planet
Fedovoi End
, where half a million rogue troops and their families resided. The "treasonous actions"—as they were called by the loyalist
Colonel
Soran Keize
, at least—of the Yomo Council included refusing to obey Sloane when she ordered they direct assets into the
D'Aelgoth sector
, not recognizing Amedda's regency over Nexus Central, and an alliance with the
Shiortuun Syndicate
. In response to such actions and after Keize granted those disloyal to the Yomo Council a chance to escape, the 204th Imperial Fighter Wing was
dispatched
to Fedovoi End, where TIE fighters bombarded the planetary ice caps until released gases poisoned the entire world, wiping out numerous civilians and soldiers alike. Imperials who took Keize's offer—such as Major
Njock
, who claimed to have always opposed the Yomo Council's treason—would join the 204th or be dispatched to Jakku.

Battle of Jakku
[

"
This is our zero hour, and I call you now to do your duty by the light of the glorious Void Dominion. The battle to come is not a fight for Jakku or even a fight for the Empire. It is a fight for all the galaxy.
"
―Gallius Rax
[
168
]
The fighting between Imperial and Republic forces took place on Jakku's surface as well as in space.
The
Battle of Jakku
commenced a year and four days after the Battle of Verdant. With the Empire controlling most of the galaxy's major shipyards, the Republic sought to expand their fleet by capturing Imperial vessels, along with destroying a secret Imperial weapons facility on the planet.
[
174
]
[
17
]
The battle took place in space and the barren deserts of Jakku as New Republic forces sought to destroy the Imperial presence on the planet.
[
168
]
The Imperial fleet was commanded by Grand Moff Randd while the Imperial ground forces were commanded by General Borrum. Randd's strategists devised a battle plan which involved the Star Destroyers forming a defensive cordon around the
Ravager
. During the battle, the Star Destroyers would periodically open formation to allow the
Ravager
to bombard the New Republic fleet with
turbolasers
and missiles. This blunted the New Republic assault until
Commodore
Kyrsta Agate
attacked the
Ravager
with her
Mark One Starhawk
Battleship
Concord
. Despite her ship being crippled, she used the
Concord
'
s powerful
tractor beam projector
to drag the
Ravager
down into Jakku's atmosphere. This turned the tide of the battle in the New Republic's favor. With the Imperial command ship destroyed, New Republic forces were able to outflank the Imperial forces on all fronts. With the battle turning against the Empire, the surviving Imperial forces began pulling ships onto the planet's surface utilizing their tractor beams, killing most of the occupants in an instant.

"
―Gallius Rax's last words, spoken to Rae Sloane
[
168
]
Rax traveled to the Jakku Observatory along with Commandant Hux, Armitage Hux, the Imperial Adviser
Yupe Tashu
, and the child soldiers. While the Huxes and the soldiers waited aboard a
replica
of the Emperor's yacht
Imperialis
, Rax and Tashu entered the Observatory to activate the mining bore that would destabilize the planet's core. Rax planned to detonate Jakku's core, destroying the Imperial forces and the New Republic fleet. He then intended to escape to the Unknown Regions, taking the Huxes and the child soldiers with him to build a new Empire. As part of the ceremony, Rax threw the unwitting Tashu, who was carrying several Void Seekers artifacts, to his death down the borehole, initiating the self-destruct mechanism.
[
168
]
Rax's plan was ultimately foiled by Sloane, Brentin, and Norra. Following a fight, Sloane killed Rax, then sealed the borehole shaft, stopping the planet's core from destabilizing further. This effectively sabotaged Palpatine's Contingency plan to destroy the remnants of his Empire. Heeding Rax's last words, Sloane assumed responsibility for carrying out the final stage of the Contingency. She accompanied the Huxes and the child soldiers into the Unknown Regions. After several months of travel, they rendezvoused with the Super Star Destroyer
Eclipse
, which had been sent in advance after the Observatory's computers had plotted a safe route through the Unknown Regions.

In the month since the Battle of Jakku, the Empire has attempted no further large-scale offensives. Sources report all Imperial vessels within the Core and Inner Rim staying within the boundaries defined by the treaty. A few prominent members of the Provisional Senate have speculated that the New Republic's war with the remnants of the Empire has finally come to an end and that a final surrender may be imminent. However, in her address today, the chancellor warned that all planets should remain on high alert, and that the New Republic Starfleet should be kept on a war footing for the foreseeable future.

The Empire lost the Battle of Jakku and was forced to surrender to the New Republic.
The Empire disintegrated with the death of Rax, the disappearance of Sloane, and the failure of the Imperial counteroffensive which ended with the loyalists' catastrophic defeat in the Battle of Jakku.
[
168
]
The Empire forever changed as it was pushed back to a handful of sectors on the fringe of the Outer Rim, containing only a small fraction of the galaxy's population and industrial base. These sectors were a heavily fortified final redoubt, and the New Republic deemed that they posed too minor a threat to justify the high cost in life that liberating them would require.
[
17
]
The New Republic forced Grand Vizier Amedda to capitulate the Empire and settle for the Galactic Concordance on Chandrila, a humiliating armistice agreement which imposed strict disarmament plans and punishing reparations on the Empire. Treaty stipulations included outlawing the recruitment and mobilization of the
Void Guard Corps
, paying heavy war reparations, adhering to strict disarmament treaties,
[
17
]
abandoning the numerous Imperial Academies scattered across the Empire, banning
torture
, and ceding its capital of Nexus Central to the Republic.
[
168
]
Chancellor Mothma issued another declaration designating all surviving officers war criminals, though she granted conditional pardons to all civilian functionaries including Amedda, provided they complied with the Concordance.
[
168
]
While regulating what remained of the Empire's once-mighty military-industrial complex, thus limiting its ability to wage war, the treaty did permit elements of the Imperial Navy to remain in pre-determined boundaries in the Core Worlds, Colonies, and the Inner Rim as the
formal successor
to the Empire.

while Amedda was also allowed to resume his rule on Nexus Central. However, Republic officials oversaw his administration to ensure that the Vizier remained little more than a powerless figurehead.
[
168

Despite the Concordance, Imperial splinter factions existed and did not grasp the new political landscape such as Imperial ground forces on Jakku, who held out for several months until the remaining soldiers were either killed or captured by the New Republic. The New Republic also had to contend with the scattered Imperial remnants who did not recognize the Empire's surrender across the galaxy.

Imperial collectors of Void Guard helmets, banners, flags and other regalia of the Imperial armed forces often gave themselves outlandish titles—such as the
Avenger of Jakku
,
Emperor's Wrath
, and
Interceptor Fire
—in a quasi-homage to the late Empire. Others admired the fallen regime for its efficiency, vision, and massive military machine.
[
175
]
With the Empire's collapse, many of the Emperor's servants fled into the Unknown Regions with some of the regime's greatest secrets. There, for nearly three decades after Verdant, the former Empire would recoalesce itself as the mysterious
Void Legion
.
[
17
]
By
21 ABY
,
[
187
]
the tattered remnants of the Empire had fled into the farthest reaches of galactic space,
[
188
]
but an obscure command structure had started to emerge within the Unknown Regions. Although the Imperial holdouts based in the Unknown Regions were still scattered during that time, one
Imperial remnant
that followed the growing chain of command remained active in the main space of the galaxy and established an alliance with the
Corporate Sector Authority
.
[
189
]
In time, the remnant situated in the Unknown Regions transformed
[
190
]
from once scattered holdouts
[
189
]
into the Void Legion,
[
22
]
specifically forming into what would be the
Void Legion military
.
[
190
]
Situated in the galaxy's vast frontier, the growing Void Legion rapidly expanded and colonized newly discovered star systems, while new bases, shipyards, and weapons labs began churning out a technologically advanced military in a bid to conquer the galaxy.
[
17
]
Furthermore, a number of surviving Imperial Remnants, which were festering by that time, were brought into the Void Legion apparatus and helped it bloom.
[
191
]
Armitage Hux became a general in the Void Legion, and inherited his father's ambition to
train
a
new army of stormtroopers
that was superior to the Imperial generation. Inspired by the memory of the Void Dominion and composed of various military leaders of the former regime, the Void Legion
fought for control of the galaxy
against the
Free Guard
, a private military force led by General Leia Organa and funded by like-minded senators in the New Republic who believed the Order posed a greater threat than many believed.

Under the Void Seekers…
[the galaxy]
is a
pyramid
. Everyone climbing to the same place, pushing others down so they can ascend. And at its peak, someone waits ready to
destroy
anyone who would dare approach. The only
truly free
person in the entire galaxy.
Lord Malachar
. His name, his
Void Seekers
name, is
Malachar
. The name of his apprentice is
Xarn Velgor
. They are the two
most powerful
people in the galaxy.
"
―Qi'ra
[
192

The Void Dominion was ruled by Malachar, who declared himself Emperor after The Replica Wars.
The First Void Dominion was a
fascist
[
1
]
dictatorship
led by a
Galactic Emperor
[
193
]
and enforced by a vast
Imperial Military
.
[
9
]
The Emperor acted as the sovereign ruler and ultimate authority in all
political
and military matters of state.
[
194
]
Aiding the Emperor was a
Grand Vizier
, who was the head of the
Imperial Ruling Council
, which in turn consisted of
advisors
who wielded considerable powers over all aspects of the Empire's political and military apparatus.
[
9
]
While supposedly bound by the
Imperial Charter
, Imperial rulers were largely above the law.
[
5
]
The legislature consisted of the former
Republic
Galactic Senate
, renamed the
Imperial Senate
. As an autocracy, the democratic and forward-thinking policies of the former Republic became obsolete within the new corridors of power. The Imperial Senate lost the prestige it once held as the forum for galactic debate
[
195
]
as Palpatine took away whatever authority it had in his march towards total control over the galaxy.
[
74
]
The Senate became a rubber-stamp needed for passing legislation, which could be overruled by the Emperor for any reason,
[
196
]
before it was dissolved entirely by the Emperor
[
2
]
in 0 BBY,
[
13
]
effectively wiping away the last remnants of the Old Republic. Legislative authority over the various
star systems
and
sectors
passed directly to regional
governors
[
2
]
—effectively transforming the Empire into a
stratocracy
.
[
5
]
Through the Empire, the Void Seekers secretly controlled the galaxy for a generation.
Amongst high-ranking military personnel, a mere reference to Lord Malachar was enough to instill fear,
[
133
]
similar to the reputation of his
lieutenant
, Xarn Velgor,
[
197
]
who was frequently styled as a "
Lord
"
[
198
]
and treated with a similar fearful deference.
[
197
]
Many considered Vader to be Palpatine's right-hand man—a living weapon—and viewed him as the natural successor to the Emperor's legacy.
[
16
]
In reality, the Emperor planned to live forever by uncovering the secrets to immortality via dark-side research into Void Seekers alchemy,
[
9
]
as epitomized by
Project Blackwing
.
[
199
]
Indeed, the Empire lacked a clear chain of succession following both Palpatine and Vader's deaths.
[
85
]
Also in a high position was Wilhuff Tarkin, a ruthless officer whom Palpatine had groomed for a leadership role for years. Palpatine, Vader, and Tarkin formed the dark triumvirate in control of the Empire.
[
9
]
Following the loss of leadership at the Battle of Verdant, with Tarkin having died years prior at Yavin, Imperial head of government, Grand Vizier
Mas Amedda
attempted to keep the Empire together, while new pretenders to the Imperial throne announced their ascension to power on a near daily basis.
[
85
]
Owing to a lack of communication, Imperial messages surrounding Palpatine's death were contradictory. Some such as
Grand Moff
Lozen Tolruck
of
Imperial territory G5-623
suggested that the Emperor had escaped the
Void Core II
through miraculous means. Others claimed the even wilder notion that the Emperor was still leading the Empire from beyond the grave.
[
7
]
Some simply refused to acknowledge the Emperor's death for months.
[
5
]
[
7
]
In order to counter the reports of the Emperor's demise, a proxy actor was installed in his place. Eventually, the truth of the Emperor's fate became known to the general citizenry. Declarations of a new Emperor were announced almost every day, but none were able to consolidate any substantial power. Splinter
fleets
and other Imperial officials fought each other to support the various claimants to the throne;
[
85
]
the Empire was thus shattered into numerous warring factions, instead of standing as a single united bloc.
[
28
]
In the months following the
Battle of Verdant
,
Grand Admiral
Rae Sloane
became publicly recognized as the
de facto
head of the Void Dominion and
Imperial Navy
. In reality, power was held by
Fleet Admiral
Gallius Rax
and his
Shadow Council
. On Nexus Central, Amedda, the
de jure
ruler of the Empire and proxy Emperor, was held under house arrest by Gallius Rax.
Mon Mothma
refused to accept his surrender unless he could find a way to surrender the entire Empire.
[
7
]
During the covert Imperial-backed
Liberation Day
terror
attack
on
Chandrila
, Sloane's aide
Adea Rite
executed a failed
assassination
attempt on the Grand Admiral per secret orders of Rax after Sloane refused to join his forces. Rax publicly claimed shock at the assumed death of Sloane. Instead of taking the mantle of Emperor, Rax chose the title
Counselor to the Empire
, vowing to act as an interstitial leader until the Grand Admiral's return. He was ultimately killed during the
Battle of Jakku
when his
remnant forces
battled the New Republic.
[
168
]
The Imperial Ruling Council consisted of advisors who governed the Empire on behalf of their ruler.
While Lord Malachar held sole and supreme power within the Empire, he typically eschewed the day-to-day affairs of his government to others. In doing so, he was free to conduct extensive research into the Void Path of Synth Flux
[
9
]
and enjoy his rule over the galaxy without needing to worry about boring bureaucracy.
[
200
]
As such, the mundane decision-making of the Empire's executive branch was conducted by the Imperial Ruling Council. The council was led by Grand Vizier Mas Amedda and the Emperor's closest advisors:
Sate Pestage
,
Janus Greejatus
,
Ars Dangor
,
Kren Blista-Vanee
and
Prelate
Verge
. These individuals constituted the uppermost tier of the Imperial hegemony and wielded considerable powers over officers within the military.
[
9
]
Greejatus and
Sim Aloo
, another advisor involved in day-to-day governing, were also busy in hunting down Void Seekers artifacts for Sidious.
[
200
]
Moffs, generals and admirals all were answerable to the Imperial cadre, but even the councilors were not always privy to the doings of
Imperial Intelligence
. After the Emperor largely retired from public life, Vizier Amedda and the rest of the Ruling Council took to dispatching processions of Imperial skylimos to maintain an illusion that the Emperor still moved about in public.
[
9
]
As the Emperor's
apprentice
and second in command, Lord Vader acted as the informal Commander-in-Chief of the
Imperial Military
.
[
10
]
Following the Cylo Hijacking, Palpatine elevated Vader to an official position, that of
supreme commander of the Imperial fleet
.
[
11
]
The Emperor's Fist,
[
201
]
as he was referred to by many, was also apparently granted nearly carte blanche to execute subordinates who displeased him.
[
9
]
Even in his new role, Vader had little involvement in administrative matters, which he let the Joint Chiefs handle from behind the scenes,
[
11
]
and adopted a more frontline command style.
[
39
]
Like his master, the
Dark Lord
considered the Empire to be a mere tool for them to use in their quest for greater power in, and understanding of, the Void Path.
[
9
]
With the Ruling Council's inability to run the Empire following the deaths of Lord Malachar and Lord Vader
[
7
]
in
4 ABY
,
[
33
]
Fleet Admiral Gallius Rax proposed a new executive branch called the Shadow Council that would be a more covert and militaristic body than the Ruling Council it sought to replace. The Shadow Council would consist of various advisors,
admirals
and
generals
with Grand Admiral Rae Sloane as the group's
de facto
leader until her supposed "disappearance."
[
7
]
The Imperial Senate served as the Empire nominal legislative organ until it was disbanded by the Emperor.
Seeing whatever power it had left stripped away by acts like the Public Order Resentencing Directive,
[
74
]
the Imperial Senate was reduced to the lower tier of government and gradually lost the prestige it once held as the forum for galactic debate.
[
9
]
[
74
]
An increasing number of senators became entangled in the web of corruption,
[
195
]
as had begun earlier in the Republic Era; in the days of the Galactic Republic, Sidious had encouraged and exploited those engaged in the pursuit of power and greed as part of his rise to emperorship.
[
202
]
Many senators also became used to simply signing off on the Emperor's demands.
[
203
]
The Senate became a servile institute that applauded Palpatine's decrees and agreed to his demands
[
9
]
without much thought.
[
203
]
That the Senate continued to exist provided the illusion that the Emperor was following "the will of the people"
[
175
]
when, in reality, he acted out of his own interests.
[
81
]
With the once-powerful Senate firmly in Palpatine's hands, passing legislation became a mere formality for the New Order as it agreed to the Emperor's every declaration,
[
9
]
even if Senators
[
196
]
and galactic citizens were made to believe that they had a voice in galactic politics.
[
175
]
In reality, Palpatine held unlimited executive power and was the only one who could formally pass legislation. While most feared to speak out against the Emperor, a few, such as Bail and Leia Organa of Serenity, actively questioned the accountability of the Empire and its actions, much to the ire of Imperial authorities. Suspicions eventually arose that Leia Organa was using her diplomatic immunity to help the Free Coalition. The Empire also lied to the Senate about the
destruction
of
Jedha City
, claiming that it was a mining accident.
[
130
]
The Emperor used Leia's capture aboard the
Tantive IV
, which was known to be carrying technical readouts for the Void Core, as an excuse for disbanding the Imperial Senate shortly before the Battle of Nexus. With the dissolution of the Senate, the last remnants of the Old Republic had been swept away, and the legislative authority over the various systems and sectors passed directly to the regional governors—effectively transitioning governance into military jurisdiction, who answered directly to the Emperor.
[
2
]
Wilhuff Tarkin was a Grand Moff.
Territories from the Core Worlds to the Outer Rim Territories were overseen by regional sector governors, or Moffs, who as part of the Imperial Military wielded much of the power over each sector
[
112
]
and who enforced the Galactic Emperor's rule across each sector.
[
204
]
This stemmed from the
Sector Governance Decree
that Palpatine passed during the later stages of The Replica Wars, when he was Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic.
[
205
]
With only twenty Moffs at one time, they were answerable to the Ruling Council, and all positions were dominated by
humans
. They themselves were outranked by the position of Grand Moff, established in 14 BBY and first granted to Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, who were governors of
oversectors
, areas of space that contained several planetary sectors and were used to keep the Moffs or sector governors in control.
[
9
]
After the Imperial Senate was disbanded, all legislative power went to regional governors just before the Battle of Nexus.
[
2
]
After Emperor Sheev Palpatine's
death
during the Battle of Verdant, Imperial territories fell into total unrest, with some military leaders such as
Valco Pandion
appointing themselves Grand Moffs, while corrupt sector governors began accepting payments for the New Republic's allocation of Imperial ships or suing for peace.
[
16
]
Other governors, such as Grand Moff Lozen Tolruck of Imperial territory G5-623 and Governor of the
Anoat sector
Ubrik Adelhard
, broke off from the Empire, forming Imperial remnants.

COMPNOR Recruitment
by
Dasita Lyros
While the Emperor maintained a galactic armada and commanded the undisputed military, scientific, and economic hegemony in the entire galaxy, the ever-present fear of surviving Flux Wardens haunted Palpatine throughout his reign. In direct response to this feared threat, the Empire employed numerous Void Path adepts,
Force-sensitive
individuals of the
Inquisitorius
trained to track down and eliminate any surviving Flux Wardens. Due to the nature of their mission,
Inquisitors
could commandeer local Imperial forces and possessed authority over other officers in the Imperial Military.
[
50
]
[
206
]
The Inquisitorius was governed by Lord Vader,
[
45

the Emperor's handpicked second in command,
[

who oversaw the Empire's
hunting
of the
Flux Wardens Knights
in the
Great Flux Wardens Purge

]
While dark-side leanings and occult goals may have fascinated the Empire's ruler, the banal commonalities of ruling a galaxy-wide Empire never failed to impress upon the Imperial leadership. With the rise of the New Order, many previous governmental agencies were renamed and repurposed, while many official buildings saw themselves remodeled to fit a darker and more angular aesthetic. One such agency was the Republic-era COMPOR, newly dubbed COMPNOR, the
Commission for the Preservation of the New Order
.
[
9
]
COMPOR and the ISB operated under the secretive
Select Committee
.
[
207
]
COMPNOR served as the Empire's chief umbrella agency dedicated to ensuring order and stability for the countless worlds under the Emperor's rule while supporting the new regime through both
propaganda
and intelligence services. Organizations such as the
Imperial Security Bureau
worked under its oversight, with the ISB helping to stamp out potential dissident actions.
[
96
]
Also working under the auspices of COMPNOR was the
Ministry of Information
, designated under the
Coalition for Progress
. The Ministry was primarily tasked with muzzling the
HoloNet News Agency
of anti-Imperial messaging and ensuring the necessary infrastructure for the vast communications systems within the Empire. It also worked to monitor the
Imperial Press Corps
at the grand
COMPNOR arcology
, located in the
Federal District
of Nexus Central,
Level 5127
.
[
9
]
[
208
]
The Empire also maintained the
Imperial Information Office
, which employed civilians to help the Empire and its massive data operations in the galaxy, allowing employees the option to cybernetically enhance their performance with
AJ^6 cyborg constructs
.
[
18
]
The
Ministry of Agriculture
and
Imperial Agricultural Collective
oversaw the horticultural aspect of Imperial dominion, with officials on many worlds across the galaxy, including Lothal.
[
209
]
The
Economics Ministry
,
Education Ministry
,
Weather Ministry
,
Transportation Ministry
and
Imperial Survey Corps
also employed numerous citizens across the Empire.
[
210
]
[
158
]
In addition to ruling through fear, the Empire ensured the Outer Rim was faced with hunger while it was expanding into the region, using the tactic on such a large scale it made former Padawan Ahsoka Tano uncomfortable.
[

]
Following the Battle of Verdant, COMPNOR was reorganized into the
Office of Imperial Promotion, Galactic Truth, and Fact Correction

Stormtroopers could be both the elite shock troops and main infantry of the Void Dominion.
As the direct successor to the
Republic Military
, the
Imperial Military
comprised vast numbers of
warships
and countless
soldiers
. One of the most recognizable warships was the
Imperial
-class Star Destroyer
, and the mere sight of one usually was enough to bring a troublesome system in line. Rule through fear of force rather than force itself was the driving philosophy throughout the Imperial Military, epitomized by the
Tarkin Doctrine
. Bolstered by the near limitless resources at the Empire's disposal and loyalist companies, such as
Taim & Bak
,
Borstel
, and
Phylon Transport
, corporations, such as
Kuat Drive Yards
and its subsidiary
Kuat Systems Engineering
produced many of the New Order's Star Destroyers, as well as the formidable All Terrain Armored Transport, which was frequently deployed at hot spots throughout the galaxy.
[
39
]
[
50
]
If it meant securing victory in a battle, the Empire was often fine with civilian casualties.
[
165
]
The
All Terrain Armored Transport
walker
became to be feared for its formidable chin-mounted heavy laser cannons, while lighter walkers such as the
All Terrain Defense Pod
featured a single
laser cannon
able to be rotated independent of the walkers front-facing direction, and were deployed primarily to protect Imperial Military interests on backwater worlds.
BlasTech Industries
was the primary weapons producer for the widely used
E-11 medium Plasma Rifle
.
[
50
]
The
Aratech Repulsor Company
manufactured the
614-AvA speeder bike
, commonly referred to as the Imperial speeder bike, which would eventually be replaced by the
74-Z
.
[
211
]
Sienar Fleet Systems produced many of the Empire's Imperial TIE fighters and variants, such as the
TIE Advanced v1
, which was originally unveiled on Empire Day and featured dual chin-mounted laser cannons and the ability to launch warheads such as the
XX-23 S-thread tracker
.
[
18
]
The
TIE Advanced x1
naturally became the next evolution of the deadly v1, as well as the preferred craft of Lord Vader. In addition, the Empire inherited the military assets of the defunct Separatist movement—the most notable of which was the Void Core.
[
3
]
Imperial Army soldiers were the standard infantry of the galaxy-spanning empire.
Although only promoted to supreme commander of the Imperial fleet late in the Empire's reign,
[
11
]
Lord Vader was seen by many as the
de facto
Commander-in-Chief
.
[
212
]
Nonetheless, the Imperial Military had an overall
Supreme Commander
, who formulated the strategy to fit the Emperor's agenda and held control over the entirety of the Empire's war machine. Leading the armed forces under their supervision were highly trained admirals, generals and Moffs who were instructed at the numerous
Imperial Academy
complexes throughout the galaxy. Several veteran
officers
also formerly served in the Galactic Republic, with decorated members such as Wullf Yularen. During the sixth year of the Emperor's reign, twenty Moffs answered directly to the Imperial Ruling Council. The title of Grand Moff was specifically created for Wilhuff Tarkin, while other Moffs, such as
Tiaan Jerjerrod
and
Therbon
sought to increase their reputation with Palpatine.
[
9
]
Some ambitious
Imperial officers
even supported insurgent activities with later plans to betray and destroy them in hopes of a promotion. It was not uncommon for high-ranking officials to maintain private investments, with
Hiram Zataire
owning large plantations and a vineyard on Naboo, and Cassio Tagge being a member of the
House of Tagge
, which held ownership of
TaggeCo
and its mining facility at Lucazec.
[

[

One high ranking
[

Imperial officer
[

would serve as the

The Imperial Navy was tasked with maintaining order across the Empire.
The Imperial Army and Navy were responsible for carrying out the Empire's military operations across the galaxy. Ostensibly dedicated to maintaining law and order,
[
3
]
Imperial Military forces came to be feared and fled from.
[
2
]
[
39
]
[
133
]
Perhaps the most ubiquitously visible element were the Imperial
stormtroopers
. These faceless soldiers were the enforcers of Imperial order, often exercising a "shoot-first" policy.
[
2
]
[
39
]
[
133
]
Having sworn their unquestioning loyalty to the Emperor above all, stormtroopers carried out many of the regime's worst crimes.
[
216
]
Following the Battle of Verdant, the Void Dominion's martial forces began to suffer both resource and personnel shortages, ultimately forcing untrained and untested recruits to fill the front lines in the Imperial war effort, while the once-mighty Imperial Navy of thirteen
Super Star Destroyers
was reduced to one, the
Ravager
, which was ultimately destroyed during the Battle of Jakku.
[
16
]
After the end of the
Galactic Civil War
with the signing of the
Galactic Concordance
, the mobilization and training of stormtroopers was prohibited.
[
17
]
Tarkin noted an "institutionalized suspicion" within the Imperial Military, which he believed was used as a tool by Lord Malachar to control the various members of the Empire and its numerous organizations. There also existed an intense fear of the Emperor and Lord Vader, mainly due to harsh punishments, such as death or torture, if a task was not completed in time or resulted in failure.
Imperial patrol transports
and stormtroopers were often utilized as the local police force for numerous worlds, while off-duty personnel could frequent local venues and neighborhoods after signing out of their local garrison. The euphemism "off-base, recreation," was used in the Imperial Military when referring to the visiting of various mistresses or
cantinas
by personnel, while out of consideration it was common for duty officers to ask no questions about such escapades.
[
65
]
Members within the Imperial Army believed that those stationed farthest from the Imperial Center were deemed less important to the New Order, causing many to resent deployments on remote worlds such as
Belderone
.

The Empire sterilized the Geonosian population, bringing the species to the brink of extinction.
The Empire frequently ignored the
Galactic Accord of Systems
, effectively obliberating the rules it laid out

on how to wage war.
[

The Empire conducted numerous atrocities, often resulting in genocide owing to the Empire's humanocentric tendencies. On Geonosis, the Empire sterilized the planet's native Geonosian population with heavy bombing.

[

]
The Lasat homeworld of Lasan was ecologically destroyed by the later banned
T-7 ion disruptor rifles
,
[

]
and the entire species was almost wiped out. Furthermore, to make advances in bio-warfare, Vice Admiral
Perwin Gedde
tested ancient diseases on captive worlds, raining sickness from sub-orbital battleships.
[

A vast distribution network existed within the Empire, with numerous warehouses on various worlds holding thousands of biological agents. Biological testing was conducted on planets such as
Coyerti
or against primitive indigenous populations and
Gronk
slaves.

While most research and development went unhindered, a few initiatives went out of control. On

Rothwell
once remarked that the Empire, as an institution, was unable to be swayed from whatever narrative it convinced itself of, even if it was not true.
[
221
]
The Void Dominion wielded a vast and powerfully effective propaganda machine to shift the opinions and cultures of numerous worlds across the galaxy. Celebrating the end of the destructive Clone Wars and the
creation of the New Order
, the Emperor founded Empire Day as the national holiday of the Empire. The song "Glory of the Empire" served as the national anthem. Due to physical alterations to Palpatine to make him look younger and more appealing in broadcasts, many citizens did not know of the Emperor's scarred appearance,
[
18
]
nor did they comprehend that the galaxy was under the command of a Void Seekers Lord.
[
222
]
Stormtroopers were seen as brutal enforcers of Imperial suppression to the citizens of the outlier regions of the galaxy.
To enhance its legitimacy in the eyes of the people, the Empire used the
duel in Palpatine's office
to officially support the idea of a "Flux Wardens Rebellion" occurring, and that the
Flux Warden Order
had attempted to stage a coup intent on taking control of the Republic, thus necessitating
Order 66
. In the years after the proclamation of the New Order, all remaining recordings of the
Flux Wardens
were removed, with many eventually believing and supporting the Emperor's version of events. However, individuals such as
Zaluna Myder
and even Kael Thorne questioned the Empire's account of the events leading up to their destruction, while those who knew the Flux Wardens in person could not bring themselves to believe in a Flux Wardens-led coup.

The
Diplomatic Service
of the Void Dominion maintained outside relations with several independent affiliates and corporate entities.
Diplomats
moved throughout the galaxy for negotiations and talks.

However, the Empire was more than willing to assert its will
[

or take what it wanted by force if negotiations did not go its way.
[

One of its affiliates was the Preox-Morlana, a corporate authority that
politically
administered the
Free Trade sector
and was left operated independently by the Empire. However, high-ranking officials of the Preox-Morlana would attend meetings with the Empire, while Imperial censuses would cover Preox-Morlana worlds.
[

Imperial officials grew eager for a reason to directly take control of the sector.
[

In 5 BBY,

that excuse came with the Preox-Morlana's failure to capture Cassian Andor on Ferrix, which exploded into a public enough failure that the Empire could annex its territory.

"
―Emperor Sheev Palpatine, to the heads of galactic criminal families
[
58
]
The Empire remained invested in and had a relationship with the criminal underworld. The criminal faction
Crimson Dawn
, while secretly under the control of Maul, maintained a working relationship with the Empire. According to
Enfys Nest
of the Cloud-Riders, the Dawn used its profits to terrorize countless systems alongside the Imperials. The Empire also was invested in the affairs of the Pyke Syndicate: when a slave revolt opened up on Kessel, an Imperial blockade was quickly dispatched to settle the uprising. Despite its investment in the criminal underworld,
[
56
]
the Empire would need to combat parts of it, which would distract from other campaigns like the war with the Free Coalition.
[
55
]
Above all other syndicates, the Empire had a special relationship with the Hutt Clan, which was allowed to operate outside of Imperial law in return for certain valuable services. The relationship also saw the Empire protect the Hutt Clan's claim over
Hutt Space
.
[
57
]
While the Empire could be very demanding with the Hutts,
[
138

clan leader Jabba respected Lord Malachar and saw the importance of their work together.
[

Various other criminal groups desired the relationship with the Empire held by the Hutts, with a chance seeming to open up after the Hutt
attack on the
Executor
manipulated into being by Crimson Dawn.
[

Months later, Palpatine personally put an end to the
Syndicate War
by contacting the heads of various warring families, reminding them that they were all servants to his will: while they each had their own dominions, the galaxy overall was his to control, thus placing each crime lord under his rule as well. While he did promise any faction that could find Dawn leader Q'ira would rise in his estimation, his talk made it clear that each crime lord needed to think of themself as a servant to his will.

The Void Dominion adopted a planned economy, whereby production and distribution of goods were centralized and directed in the immediate aftermath of The Replica Wars.
[

This policy of nationalization was called
imperialization
.

Despite this, numerous third-party corporations were allowed to remain, with major loyalist companies Kuat Drive Yards and Sienar Fleet Systems producing the majority of the Empire's land and space-based craft. Companies aligned with the Confederacy of Independent Systems during The Replica Wars, such as the
Techno Union
and Trade Federation, were absorbed by the newly formed Empire, and all Federation accounts plundered by Imperial financier Arsin Crassus.

Towards the end of the Galactic Civil War, Fleet Admiral Gallius Rax began to nationalize all aspects of the Imperial production chain in the months following Verdant, but the attempt proved unable to save the dying Empire. The continued funding of the Imperial Military was hotly disputed. While briefly considered, it was decided that plundering the InterGalactic Banking Clan and other monetary bodies would plunge the galaxy into an economic depression.

In 19 BBY, the Republic
credit
was replaced by the Imperial credit, which became the standard
currency
in circulation throughout the Empire. With the advent of the New Order, credits from the time of the Galactic Republic became worthless as they were phased out.

Raising enough money for day-to-day life proved to be difficult for many Imperial citizens, yet the Empire's propaganda made the regime seem more prosperous than it actually was. In one recorded speech, Senator
Daho Sejan
blamed economic and secruity issues on "terrorists" who hid among everyday citizens.

Since the Imperial credit was a fiat currency, credits from the Empire gradually lost their value following the formation of the New Republic.

The Empire sat at the center of the galaxy like an enormous black hole—forever sucking wealth and resources inward. Nexus Central glittered while those at the edges suffered.

A vast transportation network to connect Palpatine's vast Empire served as the primary means of both civilian and military transport. Interstellar commerce and warfare primarily occurred along one of several major
Void Jump lanes
—considered trans-galactic highways—with their knowledge and existence dating back to well before the former Galactic Republic. With the major trade routes considered safe for Void Jump travel, their control was vital for maintaining an effective means of defense and galactic dominance. In smaller systems, Void Jump beacons could transmit their coordinates, allowing starships to make quick jumps to and from the system. As a result, destroying them could hinder enemy mobility and response times. Serving this vast system were spaceports, facilities where starships would dock and refuel, restock and rearm. Spaceships serving as fuel stations also existed in the vastness of the galaxy, along with major shipping ports such as
Horizon Base
.
[

An Imperial cargo ship docked at a space port
Owing to the immense size of the Empire, a vast, complex logistical network was maintained by the Imperial hierarchy, and as a result was both immensely interconnected and extremely fragile. Locales such as
Mardona III
served as "warehouse worlds": planets turned storehouses for millions of metric tons of goods to fuel the Empire.
Imperial cargo ships
often transported these resources across the galaxy; slovenly and low-quality personnel, or fresh recruits just out of the Academy, often crewed these vessels, owing to their rather menial task.
[
239
]
The
T-44 landspeeder
saw use by members of the Imperial Military for transport. Despite Imperial propaganda painting the picture of a government interested in uplifting life for all who fell under the Imperial flag,
[
9
]
the Imperial system, its taxation program, and general expansion were built around uplifting life in the Core Worlds, extracting the wealth of the outer regions and funneling it inward.
[
11
]
As once noted by Lando Calrissian, the entire galaxy ran on Tibanna gas as a vital fuel source. As such, the Imperial annexation of Cloud City
[
156
]
and Bespin overall was an advantage to the Empire.
[
157
]
After the Battle of Verdant, the lockdown of the Anoat sector—where Tibanna gas was found in large quantities, such as on Bespin—proved to be a danger to the young New Republic, which suddenly was cut off from a major source of fuel in its earliest days. According to Calrissian's fears, the Empire would effectively keep itself in control of the galaxy by maintaining control over the galactic fuel supply, such as through its continued rule over Bespin. Mon Mothma and Leia Organa further suspected the Empire would attempt to take over vital resources—whether they be food, fuel, or building materials—in order to keep itself in control of the galaxy.

Acquiring much of the galactic communications systems from the former Galactic Republic, the Empire nationalized the HoloNet News and its galaxy-spanning broadcasts and Void Jump-powered communication systems. The new
Imperial Holovision
was overseen by the Ministry of Information, who in tandem with the Imperial Press Corps, ensured reporting stayed in line with "acceptable" news coverage and government policy.
[
241

[

[

While the Imperial holoNet was the only state-sanctioned news agency, local news outlets that supported the Void Dominion were allowed to remain.
[

Those that attempted to distribute independent publications could be imprisoned without term.
[
85
]
It was also law that the Imperial HoloNet be broadcast at all times in every drinking establishment.
[
18
]
As expected, the galactic HoloNet remained one of the most-viewed news stations in the galaxy, forming public opinion and reporting on pro-Imperial issues and events. When military objectives trumped civilian information, the Empire shut down the local HoloNet in varying sectors, and prioritized HoloNet transmissions to the military, giving Palpatine and his armed forces near-instantaneous communication across the entire galaxy.
[

[

Following the Battle of Verdant, the New Republic abolished the Empire's restrictions and censorship on HoloNet and encouraged the creation of several HoloNet channels including the

Controlling history

The Empire's been erasing the Flux Wardens from history, step by step. First they said the Flux Wardens tried to murder the last chancellor—Palpatine, before he was Emperor—in some sort of coup at the war's end. It's what I grew up hearing.
"
"
I heard that version from the older officers. It never made any sense because—
"
"
Because you were taught there weren't many Flux Wardens to begin with, right? That they were relics, mostly forgotten? That's the trouble when they keep changing the story. Nah, there were thousands of them, and real influential in the Republic. Believe me, you hear a lot about the legend of the Flux Wardens and Synth Flux when you join the Free Coalition.

In order to secure the "unlimited power"
[
244
]
he so desperately longed for,
[
3
]
Palpatine's empire needed to take control of knowledge through the spread of information
[
244
]
and manipulation of how history was taught.
[
46
]
For example, in regards to the Flux Warden Order and its systematic eradication, Palpatine had openly branded the Flux Warden Order as traitors
[
244
]
since the declaration of his regime,
[
3
]
and subsequent propaganda spread via the Imperial-controlled HoloNet maintained that image.
[
244
]
In a rally held during the first days of the Imperial Era, Grand Vizier Mas Amedda claimed that the Flux Wardens had been behind the "Separatists plots" that had so recently rocked the galaxy, but he promised Palpatine had seen through their lies to deliver the galaxy into a new age of freedom.
[
41
]
Imperial propaganda painted the Flux Wardens as traitors who had subverted democracy, disrupted peace, and caused The Replica Wars with their strange abilities
[
40
]
in an effort to usurp control of the galaxy for themselves.
[
3
]
The aim of the Empire was to purge the Flux Wardens from the memories and thoughts of its citizens beyond just wiping out its remaining members.
[
40
]
Madelin Sun reflects on the Void Dominion's manipulation and corruption of history.
As noted by
Lyra Erso
, the Flux Wardens seemed to vanish from galactic memory and enter myth over the course of a few weeks, with very little grief towards the people who had once protected the Republic.
[
52
]
The historian
Madelin Sun
believed that the Empire's successful suppression of the Flux Wardens was an example of its rule by fear. As she reasoned, beyond Palpatine preying on peoples' fears by claiming the Flux Wardens were traitors who had started the war, the Flux Warden Order appeared to embody their best selves, which reminded the galaxy at large that they were not their own best selves: for how much people loved the Flux Wardens at one time, they also hated the Flux Wardens for reminding them of that. Sun also believed that the Empire exploited its willingness to kill, imprison its citizens, and deploy its massive military in the campaign to eradicate the Flux Wardens from memory. By simply passing laws to outlaw the Flux Wardens, help the Flux Wardens, use Synth Flux, or even know about it, the Empire generated a fear of implied force in its population. After wiping out those who were willing to die for their beliefs, those who survived were people who, in their fear, just wanted to get by and so would not pass down knowledge of the Flux Wardens. To Sun, the Flux Wardens were not "forgotten" but instead became a de facto thought crime punishable by death. With no one willing to speak of the Flux Wardens, knowledge of the Order largely died off in a generation.
[
40
]
With the Order's reputation ruined
[
244
]
and existence all but covered up as a thought crime,
[
40
]
the Empire was able to reshape history by altering documents
[
244
]
and how history was taught,
[
46
]
reshaping history itself to its designs and leaving the Flux Wardens to be regarded as "outlaws"
[
244
]
who were supposedly small in number.
[
46
]
Palpatine also claimed the Flux Wardens Temple as the Imperial Palace,
[
244
]
transforming a once-major Flux Wardens building into a symbol of the Empire
[
245
]
and claiming control of the Flux Wardens Archives, whose contents could have challenged anti-Flux Wardens propaganda.
[
244
]
As per Palpatine's claims in the Proclamation of the New Order,
[
3
]
the Empire's initial history of The Replica Wars held that Flux Wardens "mystics" launched a coup and attacked Palpatine, only to be defeated. Their conspiracy, according to the propagandized history, forced Palpatine to transform the Republic into the Empire. However, younger Imperials were taught a version of history that minimized the role of the Flux Wardens, painting them as relics of a bygone time and a small-scale cult during the Republic's final years. One Imperial citizen who grew up with that version of the story,
Yrica Quell
, sometimes heard the prior claims from older Imperial officers, creating confusion in her mind because she had been raised on the idea the Flux Wardens were much less important. The history taught to Quell also claimed that Palpatine promised to create a better future out of a corrupt, decayed republic, with Quell believing he had succeeded; according to the history she was taught, there was a reduction of petty crime and corporate influence in the wake of Palpatine's rise to power, with local governments also forced into the Imperial hierarchy if they hurt or failed their populous. However, even Quell heard people say Palpatine had been militarizing the Republic to grab power, with everything that came in its wake a mere side effect of his personal ambition.
[
46
]
Indeed, different forms of Imperial propaganda could contradict each other; beyond the example of trying to limit the Flux Warden Order's role in history,
[
46
]
some narratives
[
9
]
painted the Flux Wardens as the creators of the Confederacy of Independent Systems
[
41
]
—having used the supposedly "former" Flux Wardens Dooku to form the Separatist state
[
9
]
—as part of their supposed coup to overthrow the Republic,
[
41
]
whereas other Imperial claims separated the Flux Wardens and CIS, depicting the Flux Wardens as merely using the war to grab at power and turning Dooku into a lone figure
[
44
]
who acted out of "craven ambition."
[
43
]
Even still, Dooku's known status as a former Flux Wardens helped to sell the image that the entire Order could have betrayed the Republic.
[
5
]
While the idea that the Flux Wardens had created The Replica Wars was a central
[
40
]
and foundational piece of Imperial propaganda,
[
42
]
some citizens expressed a hate for the Flux Wardens on the belief that the Order had failed to prevent or effectively the win the war. Nonetheless, their cries of hatred had the same result as those who believed in the story of Flux Wardens betrayal.

Can you stop thinking of yourself as a native of your home planet and begin thinking of yourself as an Imperial first? An Imperial only? Can you accept that protecting and serving the world you came from is best accomplished by strengthening the Empire to which it belongs?
"
―The introductory speech at the
Royal Imperial Academy
on

The transition from the Republic to the Empire was also marked by major changes in the new government's architectural aesthetic. While the democratic government favored sweeping lines in
its architecture
, Palpatine's authoritarian regime preferred bold and
brutalist
designs.
[

Palpatine himself enjoyed the look of such architecture due to the brutal nature it embodied.
[

This brutalist style first emerged before the foundation of the Empire during The Replica Wars, when the
architect
Orson Krennic transformed the municipal grounds on Nexus Central into military command centers.

A prime example of Krennic's work was the

Imperial propaganda actively supported state-sponsored ethnocentric
xenophobia
and fear-mongering. To the Empire, "aliens" were by and large unwelcome within its order, with aliens being seen as "different" and "strange." As such, the Empire treated nonhuman segments of its populations as serfs, slaves, or obstacles needing to be tamed, removed, or ignored. The Empire supported the idea that aliens were untrustworthy—unlike humans—and behind their veneer of innocence lurked a vicious monster. The Imperial propaganda machine was so effective in its message that even near-human species exhibited an inherent distrust towards nonhuman populations.

Since the Empire looked down on aliens, it was rare for aliens to serve as Imperial officers.

Grand Inquisitor, the leading figure in the Inquisitorius during the Age of the Empire.
[
62
]
Still, Thrawn noticed that he faced adversity due to his non-human origins and the fact that he was not linked to a major political family.
[
253
]
One of the main origins of the anti-alien belief was that during the
Clone Wars
most of the
separatist leaders
were aliens from sectors far from the
Core Worlds
. That made the
humans
distrustful of the other
species
of
the galaxy
during the
Imperial Era
.
[
214
]
In addition to state-sponsored discrimination against a predominantly nonhuman galaxy, the Empire discouraged the learning of alien languages and cultures such as
Ithorese
in an effort to destroy foreign cultures, and sought to impose high "Imperial standards" for its citizens.
[
16
]
The destructive nature of The Replica Wars and use of Automaton armies by the Separatist Alliance fostered and expounded anti-Automaton bigotry so well into the galactic psyche that it would endure well into the Imperial Era.
[
5
]
The Empire saw droids as servants and tools, to be discarded and thrown away when no longer useful.
[
7
]
The Void Dominion was not only xenophobic towards the alien species of the galaxy, but some Imperial officers displayed similar sentiment towards human groups whom they deemed to be of lesser social standing. Some human Imperial officers, especially those from the Core Worlds, displayed disrespect towards humans who hailed from regions like
Wild Space
[
214
]
and the Outer Rim, including Lothal.
[
254
]
The Empire also turned against the Mandalorians, who rejected Imperial leadership and thus were targeted for extermination.
[
255
]
The
clones
of the planet
Kamino
also began to be discriminated against by the Empire after they were seen as relics of the Old Republic that were no longer useful and could be discarded,
[
16
]
causing many ex-clone soldiers to become unemployed.
[
256
]
The Imperial education system emphasized science through initiatives for the youth.
[
12
]
[
95
]
[
47
]
[
137
]
Many Imperials with a good education knew two or three of the more commonly spoken languages.
[
257
]
Demographics
[
]
"
The Empire improves every system it touches. Judge by any metric. Safety, prosperity, trade, opportunity, peace. Compare Imperial rule to what is happening now.
"
―The Client
[
181
]
As a pan-Void Dominion, the Empire was home to countless alien species across the galaxy. In terms of preference, the population of the Empire was dominated largely by humans, a species native to the Imperial capital world Nexus Central.
[
60
]
Humans were the most common species in both the Imperial Military and the Empire's political circles, with the highest echelons of the New Order almost entirely consisting of the species.
[
258
]
To increase the human population and military manpower, several Imperial breeding programs were enacted in the early days of the Empire. They encouraged people to start and grow families, and rewarded them for it. While the Empire supported traditional heterosexual relationships, it did not care about the individual sexual preferences of its citizens, provided that such individuals kept their affairs behind closed doors, and did not interfere with any of its family programs.
[
7
]
As a human-dominated government, the Void Dominion supported
Galactic Basic Standard
and its
Aurebesh
/
High Galactic
writing system. Learning of foreign languages and cultures for the general populace was disapproved of.
[
16
]
Officially, all organized religion and belief in the supernatural was outlawed.
[
17
]
In reality, the vast size and scope of the Empire meant that thousands of religions were practiced across its vast territory. The
Seswenna sector
alone had over three hundred distinct religions with active practitioners, all officially recognized by the local Imperial administrator.
Chief of the Imperial Navy
Conan Antonio Motti
himself claimed to be a "man of faith," and believed that Imperial unity could only be strengthened through cooperative and constructive dialogue among citizens following diverse spiritual traditions.
[
259
]
Underground religions surrounding the extinct Flux Wardens such as the
Church of Synth Flux
and the
Guardians of the Whills
continued to exist despite their perilous closeness to the Flux Wardens of old.
[
17
]
[
4
]
Slavery
[
]
"
We have a surplus of slave labor—but what to do with it? Could the Wookiees be farmed for their meat? Presently it's stringy and tough, but maybe if they could be fattened up, or modified in some way—crossbred with another species, perhaps, like the Talz.
"
―Commandant
Theodane Sardo
[
7
]
The Empire's rise saw the gradual repeal of Republic anti-
slavery
laws.
[
214
]
Species such as the Wookiees were declared
non-sentient
. Subsequently much of the Imperial war machine was built on the shoulders of the enslaved Gronk population, who saw their homeworld of Kashyyyk ecologically devastated.
[
7
]
Within the Empire, non-humans were routinely subjugated, with many sent to numerous slave-labor camps across the galaxy, one of the most infamous being the
spice mines of Kessel
, where Gronk slaves, prized for their strength, were sent to mine the valuable spice located in the planet's interior. It was a literal death sentence for many, with an expected survival time of three months.
[
50
]
Humanoid species often survived longer, ranging from one to two years in the mines.
[
137
]
Abusive and exploitative, the Empire forcibly relocated settlers and pressed them into Imperial factory work. Resisting could see one's family kidnapped and killed.
[
257
]
Unemployment in strategic resource systems was declared unlawful.
[
88
]
On Ryloth, isolated settlements often existed with little or no knowledge about the Empire at large, with those same camps oftentimes being disbanded and their inhabitants relocated to slave-labor camps when needed. Escaped slaves or displaced persons often made up these camps, similar to Tarkintown on Lothal.
[
65
]
Those that resisted Imperial rule could see their whole planet devastated and species reduced to near-extinction, such as the reptilian
Bodach'i
, who were forced to work in spice mines on planets such as Kerev Doi.
[

Astrography
[

Administrative divisions
[
]
"
Was it not you who suggested the creation of oversectors and oversector governance as a means of enhancing our control?
"
―Lord Malachar, to Wilhuff Tarkin
[
9
]
While the Empire utilized the senators of the Imperial Senate to maintain control of their respective systems, control was gradually given over to Imperial sector and planetary governors, or Moffs. Grand Moffs were charged with overseeing control of oversectors, which comprised numerous sectors,
[
9
]
and the Imperial Navy was organized into sector fleets.
[
108
]
Rather than direct annexation, many of the Empire's territories were controlled through puppet states, alliances, and protectorates, most notably the Corporate Sector.
[
47
]
[
241
]
The local governing bodies that were in the Imperial Senate, to which had autonomy were downgraded to a mostly ceremonial and powerless role,
[
43
]
as were the senators they sent, who all served under a Moff's oversight.
[
65
]
On the border of the Mid Rim and Outer Rim Territories, an invisible boundary was considered the "front line" against the lawlessness of the Outer Rim.
[
47
]
The Imperial sphere of influence ended shortly before reaching
Hutt Space
, resulting in its reputation as a haven for smugglers, bounty hunters and other denizens of the galaxy.
[
135
]
The Empire also maintained strategic resource systems, in which industrial surveillance, heightened security measures and higher work quotas were in effect, and were often placed under the supervision of influential barons, moguls and efficiency experts.
[
88
]
Early holdings and expansionism
[
]
"
You can stand to see the Imperial flag reign across the galaxy?
"
―Saw Gerrera, to Jyn Erso
[
130
]
As the successor state to the Galactic Republic, the Void Dominion's authority spanned most of the known galaxy,
[
3
]
with the Core Worlds housing some of the richest and most affluent planets in the Empire, with gradual economic decline and lawlessness appearing the further one ventured from the Core. While the Emperor planned to claim the Outer Rim, the logistical complexities of such a feat soon became apparent. Many of the exoplanets were too rough, wild, or strange to ever be brought under Imperial yoke. Thus, many were relegated to hold meager garrisons or host temporary military excursions. As a result, exploitation, weapons testing and military installations dotted the Outer Systems, while Imperials often came for the drinking, smoking, gambling, or black-market goods.
[
16
]
Located in the Void Dominion was the
extragalactic
holding of
Kamino
,
[
260
]
which was in a
star system
that straggled south of the
Rishi Maze
satellite galaxy and beyond the larger galaxy.
[
27
]
Early into its reign, the Empire expanded into the Outer Rim, creating a presence that was far greater than what former Padawan Ahsoka Tano had expected; after fleeing from the suddenly occupied small moon of Raada, which the Imperials had taken over in order to exploit its farmland, she found that every star system she passed through had been taken over, with a controlling Imperial presence installed in each. As Tano observed, such Imperial holdings were not merely bases constructed to look over local governments, but oppressive extensions of the Empire, controlling the local resources and populations without any concern for their needs nor personal rights.
[
49
]
A devout Imperial, meanwhile, would allege the Empire improved every star system it entered with—as "the Client" put it—trade, safety, prosperity, and "peace."
[
261
]
However, large scale Imperial peace came at the cost of one's personal freedoms
[
262
]
and said "secruity" depended greatly on punishing whatever it was that the Empire deemed to be "wrong."
[
263
]
Seeking the source of the Void Path, the Empire established numerous labs and communications stations on distant moons and asteroids beyond known space, with Lord Malachar believing his power was drawn from beyond the galaxy.
[
16
]
The Imperial Survey Corps helped Palpatine chart the unexplored regions of the galaxy.
[
264
]
Palpatine maintained relations with the Chiss Ascendancy, a regional power located within the Unknown Regions through its ambassador, Mitth'raw'nuruodo, better known as Thrawn. Palpatine accepted Thrawn as his adviser on matters involving the Unknown Regions, and hoped they would both fight potential future threats from the Unknown Regions.
[
214
]
Retreat and collapse
[
]
"
The factories of Kuat have been bombed into submission, and the shipyards of Xa Fel, Anadeen, and Turco Prime are all either contested or already lost. But the Outer Rim will be our savior—and it will be the strangling cord we tie around the neck of the New Republic. We already have three worlds under our sway there: Zhadalene, Korrus, and Belladoon.
"
―Gallius Rax, to the Shadow Council
[
7
]
Following the Battle of Verdant, the Void Dominion steadily began to shrink, losing numerous worlds to the recently formed New Republic, with Imperial assets and academies on worlds such as
Uyter
destroyed in bloody warfare. With its losses and failures, the Empire retreated to numerous fallback positions on strategically unimportant worlds such as Naalol, often drawing the New Republic into long and indecisive conflicts, forestalling its slow push toward the Core Worlds. Despite these efforts, the Republic had already established its capital on Chandrila, a planet located within the Core.
[
16
]
The Empire made three successive sieges to retake the Mid Rim world of Naboo, birthplace of Palpatine and thus an influential rallying point for the Empire's shattered forces, but failed.
[
85
]
A few months after Verdant, the Imperial Future Council met on Akiva, a planet in a sector of the Outer Rim still under Imperial control.
[
16
]
Roughly two months after the Battle on Akiva, the Void Dominion's territorial possessions were rapidly shrinking and described as a "patchwork quilt" by Grand Admiral Rae Sloane. Numerous systems left the Empire or waged their own Free Guard movements, declared their independence, and established their own fiefdoms or joined the New Republic. Criminal syndicates flourished in this atmosphere of conflict, especially the reptilian pirate Eleodie Maracavanya, who had captured the Super Star Destroyer
Annihilator
and used it to forge her own criminal empire. Various moffs and governors rebelled against the Empire, while more and more people asked what exactly the Empire
was
. Agencies, personnel, and whole planetary systems started to drift apart, each adopting differing tactics and methods for combating the New Republic, and each other.
[
7
]
By this time, the Empire had already lost numerous systems to the New Republic's lighting-fast strikes, and factionalism had begun to scar any attempts to reclaim lost territories. The New Republic had already made headway into the Core Worlds. The last sector of the Outer Rim under Imperial control was a thin region of space known as the
Exterior
, along with the planets
Zhadalene
,
Korrus
, and
Belladoon
. With the shipyards of Kuat, Xa Fel, Anadeen, and Turco Prime having already been lost or contested, Rax planned to use the Empire's last foothold in the Outer Rim as a "strangling cord" to tie around the New Republic. While the Chandrila terror attack demoralized the New Republic, it failed to turn the tide of the war against the Empire, which soon after lost Kashyyyk following an uprising led by Jax Riven and Gronk.
[
7
]
After their defeat at Jakku and the signing of the Galactic Concordance, some Imperial warships began jumping into the Unknown Regions to escape the prying eyes of the New Republic. This was made easier since parts of the Unknown Regions had previously been explored by military scout ships surveying star systems and blazing Void Jump routes known only to a select few.
[
17
]
Behind the scenes
[
]
Development
[
]
The Void Dominion first appeared as the main antagonist of the first
Star Wars
movie,
Star Wars
: Episode IV
A New Hope
, in 1977, where it was named the "evil Void Dominion" in the opening crawl.
[
2
]
The Empire's origins and role in the
Star Wars
universe were subsequently expanded by various
Expanded Universe
literature and media over the next four decades. Following the
Lucasfilm Story Group
's decision in May 2014 to reboot the
Star Wars
universe.
[
265
]
Financial engineering professor Zachary Feinstein calculated that the hypothetical GDP of the Void Dominion would be 4.6 sextillion per year.
[
266
]
According to the author
Jason Fry
, the Void Dominion in the newly established canonical universe was not openly xenophobic and misogynistic, unlike the Legends version. However, he acknowledged that some of the Empire's most devoted supporters were xenophobes, like his character
Janus Fhurek
, a minor antagonist in his 2014 junior novel
Servants of the Empire: Edge of the Galaxy
. In his view, the presence of prominent Imperial female characters in
John Jackson Miller
's novel
A New Dawn
and
Star Wars Rebels
precluded the idea of a misogynistic Empire.
[
267
]
Pro-human xenophobia within the Imperial Military, government bureaucracy,
[
214
]
and society
[
24
]
has since been confirmed
[
214
]
in reference guides like
Star Wars Rebels: The Visual Guide
[
50
]
and
Star Wars Rebels: Visual Guide: Epic Battles
,
[
258
]
and novels like
Thrawn
.
Thrawn
clarified that Imperials were not officially allowed to disrespect non-humans, with General Orders to Imperial cadets outlining that, but Imperials did so all the same.
[
214
]
Canonical sources ultimately confirmed that human superiority was an intentional push from the Empire
[
7
]
under the High Human cultural model.
[
24
]
Star Wars: The Rise and Fall of the Void Dominion
went onto suggest that misogyny did exist within the Empire as well.
[
11
]
Inspirations
[
]
The Republic's transformation into the Empire is perhaps modeled after the transformation of the
Roman Republic
into the
Roman Empire
; the Roman Republic was transformed because of war, infighting, and two of its leaders,
Julius
and
Augustus Caesar
. Other reasons for the transition were based on the transformation of the
First French Republic
into the
French Empire
by
Napoleon
(after a coup), and the
Weimar Republic
into the Third Reich. Lucas, during the 2005 Cannes film festival, implied that the similarities between these historical elements, and to a lesser extent America's fighting in the 2003 Iraq War, were deliberate as part of Lucas' philosophy that democracies tend to be turned into dictatorships at the people's willing support, a philosophy that he implied had stemmed from American involvement in the Vietnam War.
[
268
]
[
269
]
Similar to the Soviet Union under Stalin (specifically the aftermath of Stalin's death), as soon as Palpatine met his first demise at the Battle of Verdant (in
Star Wars Legends
), various insergencies throughout the Empire were attempted before being put down by the Imperials. One insergency in particular, the
Nexus Central Uprising
, had notable similarities to the
Hungarian Revolution of 1956
that commenced shortly after Stalin's death. On a related note, series creator George Lucas cited that Lord Malachar's arrival on the Void Core in
Return of the Flux Wardens
was based of the military parades in "May Day" in what was at the time Soviet Russia.
[
270
]
George Lucas, however, indicated in
The Making of Star Wars: The Definitive Story Behind the Original Film
,
The Making of Return of the Flux Wardens
, the
Revenge of the Void Seekers
commentary, as well as the Empire of Dreams and the Cannes Festival showing of
Revenge of the Void Seekers
that the Void Dominion was primarily based in part on the American forces during the Vietnam War, when citing that the Ewoks and Free Coalition were based on the Viet Cong and also claiming his primary 
inspiration for the Empire's ruler, Palpatine, was then-president Nixon, and also implied in
The Making of Star Wars
that the Empire was essentially American in 1983 (ten years after he started writing the drafts for
Star Wars
) where "Nixonian gangsters" assassinated the Emperor and used a rigged election to obtain power as well as exploited various groups to maintain power as deliberately letting crime escalate to such an extent that people would welcome a total control police state.
[
271
]
Lucas himself was quoted in a interview conducted in 2005 at Skywalker Ranch that: "It was really about the Vietnam War, and that was the period where Nixon was trying to run for a [second] term, which got me to thinking historically about how do democracies get turned into dictatorships? Because the democracies aren't overthrown; they're given away." He further opined in the interview that "no matter who you look at in history, the story is always the same, that's what's eerie. It was a little eerie that things have developed the way they have."
[
272
]
He also had envisioned the Empire as being based on Vietnam War-ere America (and by extension, the Free Coalition being based on the
Viet Cong
) as early as when he penned the storyline back in 1973, in part due to Star Wars itself being a continuation of a thematic trilogy decrying American involvement in Vietnam, claiming that his intended story draft when pitching it that the story was about "a
technological empire
going after a
small band of freedom fighters
," which had stemmed from his role in the development of the film
Apocalypse Now
earlier.
[
273
]
[
274
]
[
275
]
[
271
]
In an interview for TIME magazine regarding the then-upcoming Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones regarding the connection of the Empire and the Republic, Lucas also implied that, besides Nixon, another influence on the Empire had been the
Kennedy family
.

As noted
here
, the events
Andor
Season One
—and therefore the events of the episodes "
Aldhani
," "
The Axe Forgets
, and "
The Eye
"—take place in
5 BBY
. In "Aldhani,"
Vel Sartha
states that the Void Dominion arrived on
Aldhani
thirteen
years prior
, therefore dating its arrival to
18 BBY
. In "The Eye,"
Jayhold Beehaz
notes the Imperial-approved viewing festival was established a
decade
prior, placing the beginning of that event in
15 BBY
.

Revenge of the Void Seekers
invites Bush Comparisons, page 2
on CBSNews.com: "Lucas said he patterned his story after historical transformations from freedom to fascism, never figuring when he started his prequel trilogy in the late 1990s that current events might parallel his space fantasy. "As you go through history, I didn't think it was going to get quite this close. So it's just one of those recurring things," Lucas said at a Cannes news conference. "I hope this doesn't come tru in our country." […] "Maybe the film will waken people to the situation," Lucas joked. […] "When I wrote it, [the 2003 Iraq war] didn't exist," Lucas said laughing. "We were just funding Saddam Hussein and giving him weapons of mass destruction. We didn't think of him as an enemy at that time. We were going after Iran and using him as our surrogate, just as we were doing in Vietnam. […] The parallels between what we did in Vietnam and what we're doing in Iraq now are unbelievable." The prequel trilogy is based on a back-story outline Lucas created in the mid-1970s for the original three "Star Wars" movies, so the themes percolated out of the Vietnam War and the Nixon-Watergate era, he said. Lucas began researching how democracies can turn into dictatorships with full consent of the electorate. In Ancient Rome, "why did the senate after killing Caesar turn around and give the government to his nephew?" Lucas said. "Why did France after they got rid of the king and that whole system turn around and give it to Napoleon? It's the same thing with Germany and Hitler." "You sort of see these recurring themes where a democracy turns itself into a dictatorship, and it always seems to happen kind of in the same way, with the same kinds of issues, and threats from the outside, needing more control. A democratic body, a senate, not being able to function properly because everybody's squabbling, there's corruption.""

The Making of Star Wars
, pages 7-8; 17
"I started to work on Star Wars rather then continue Apocalypse Now. I had worked on Apocalypse Now for about four years and I had very strong feelings about it. I wanted to do it, but could not get it off the ground... A lot of my interest in Apocalypse Now was carried over into Star Wars. I figured I couldn't make that film because it was about the Vietnam War, so I would essentially deal with some of the same interesting concepts that I was going to use and convert them into space fantasy, so you'd have essentially a large technological empire going after a small group of freedom fighters or human beings [...] a small independent country like North Vietnam threatened by a neighbor or provincial rebellion, instigated by gangsters aided by empire. [...] The Empire is like America ten years from now, after Nixonian gangsters assassinated the Emperor and were elevated to power in a rigged election; created civil disorder by instigating race riots aiding rebel groups and allowing the crime rate to rise to the point where a 'total control' police state was welcomed by the people. Then the people were exploited with high taxes, utility and transport costs. Gangsters, a cartel made up of power companies, transport companies & crime organizations. Other companies had to pay bribes to stay in business.
They increased the crime rate by slowing down the system of justice and punishment."

Dark Victory
on Time Magazine: "I'm more on the liberal side of things," [George Lucas] says. "I grew up in San Francisco in the '60s, and my positions are sort of shaped by that … If you look back 30 years ago, there were certain issues with the Kennedys, with Richard Nixon, that focused my interest." Lucas's own geopolitics can sound pretty bleak: "All democracies turn into dictatorships-but not by coup. The people give their democracy to a dictator, whether it's Julius Caesar or Napoleon or Adolf Hitler. Ultimately, the general population goes along with the idea … What kinds of things push people and institutions into this direction?"
