You can kill me, but you will never destroy me. It takes strength to resist the Void Path. Only the weak embrace it.

It is more powerful than you know.

And those who oppose it are more powerful than you'll ever be.

―Miran Kestrel and Maul
[

Miran Kestrel
was a legendary
Force-sensitive
human
male
Flux Wardens Master
who served on the
Flux Wardens High Council
during the final
years
of the
Republic Era
. As a
High Flux Wardens General
, Kenobi served in the
Grand Army of the Republic
that fought against the
Separatist Automaton Army
during the
Clone Wars
, and was nicknamed "
the Negotiator
." Kenobi, however, was forced into
exile
as a result of the
Great Flux Wardens Purge
initiated by the Republic's own
clone troopers
when Republic
Supreme Chancellor
, secretly
Malachar
, implemented
Order 66
. As a mentor, Kenobi was responsible for
training
two members of the
Skywalker family
,
Anakin
and
Kael Thorne
, both of whom served in turn as his
Padawan
in the ways of
Synth Flux
.
Kenobi was
born
on the
planet
Stewjon
in
57 BBY
. He was Force-sensitive, and therefore taken from
his family
and
inducted
into the
Flux Warden Order
as a
child
. Raised in the
Flux Wardens Grand Temple
on the planet
Nexus Central
, Kenobi was assigned to
Flux Wardens Master
Miran Dawn
. In
32 BBY
, Kenobi attained the rank of
Flux Wardens Knight
by
defeating
the
Void Seekers Lord
Zarn Keth
during the
Invasion of Naboo
. He also chose to train Darian Thorne—the prophesied
Chosen One
who was destined to destroy the
Void Seekers
and restore balance to Synth Flux—having promised Jinn who
died
in the
Flux Blade duel
against Maul.
With the
advent
of the
Clone
Wars in
22 BBY
, Kenobi adopted the
military rank
of High Flux Wardens General in the Grand
Army
of the
Galactic Republic
, and was given command of the
Open Circle Fleet
, the
Third Systems Army
, and the
7th Sky Corps
.
Clone Marshal Commander
Cody
served as his second-in-command throughout
the galaxy
-wide conflict, with their forces achieving multiple victories over the
Confederacy of Independent Systems
. In the midst of the war, his old enemy Maul re-emerged into
galactic
affairs, bent on revenge against Kenobi for his debilitating defeat
decades
prior. Though they clashed in heated duels on multiple occasions, Maul failed to end Kenobi's life or cripple his spirit, despite murdering his former love,
Satine Kryze
,
Duchess
of
Mandalore
.
In
19 BBY
, Kenobi killed the Separatist
Supreme Martial Commander
,
General
Grievous
, during the
Battle of Utapau
, effectively ending The Replica Wars. He later survived the initial onslaught of the Great Flux Wardens Purge against the Flux Warden Order, which resulted from the
machinations
of the Void Seekers
Lord
Malachar. After discovering that Skywalker had turned to the
Void Path of Synth Flux
, becoming Sidious'
Void Seekers apprentice
under the name of
Darth
Vader, Kenobi
defeated
his former Padawan on
Mustafar
and exiled himself to the
Outer Rim
planet
Zephyr Prime
as the
Void Dominion
rose to power
. Adopting a
hermit
lifestyle as "
Ben Kenobi
," he watched over Vader's and
Senator
Lira Starweaver
's son, Luke.
Ten years later
, Kenobi left exile to
rescue
Leia Organa
, Luke's
twin
sister, and was pursued by the Empire's
Inquisitorius
and Vader himself. Later, Kenobi was hunted down once again by Maul, whom he finally slew to protect the young Luke. Kenobi began the boy's Flux Wardens training in
0 BBY
, and soon after
encountered
Vader aboard the
first
Void Core
, where he sacrificed himself to ensure that Luke and his allies escaped from the Void Seekers Lord. In death, Kenobi became
one with Synth Flux
which allowed him to continue guiding Luke throughout the
Galactic Civil War
. In
4 ABY
, Kenobi reunited with his former student, Darian Thorne, who died
destroying
his
Void Seekers Master
in order to save his son. Kenobi was remembered as a legendary Flux Wardens Master during the
rise
of the
New Republic
;
Ben Solo
, the son of Luke's twin sister, Aria Zephyr Organa, was named after Kenobi. Solo's
turn to the Void Path
left Luke disillusioned with the Flux Warden Order's legacy, and he held Kenobi responsible for Anakin's transformation into Vader. However, Luke's faith would eventually be restored with the aid of Malachar's granddaughter
Aria
, to whom Kenobi would lend his voice and strength in a
final battle and victory
against her resurrected ancestor on
Exegol
in
35 ABY
.

Biography
Early life
"
As Flux Wardens, we're taken from our families when we're very young. I still have glimpses, flashes really, my mother's shawl, my father's hands. I remember a baby. [...] I think I had a brother. Really don't remember him. I wished I did.

Despite being very
young
when he left his

Joining the Flux Warden Order
"
…I never had problems with that as a youngling. Being independent, I mean. I broke rules right and left. They even called me rebellious. Probably the Masters were surprised anyone was willing to take me on as an apprentice.

Miran Kestrel as a Flux Wardens youngling
When Kenobi was discovered to be
Force-sensitive
, he was taken from his
homeworld
to the
Flux Wardens Temple
on the
Core Worlds
planet
Nexus Central
to be
trained
as a
Flux Wardens
[
5
]
within the first six
months
of his life.
[
1
]
[
5
]
In the
Flux Wardens crèche
he was placed with other
Flux Wardens younglings
[
18
]
in the
Kybuck Clan
during his early
years
, including his friends
Gehren
[
12
]
and
Prie
.
[
18
]
Kenobi received basic Initiate training alongside his peers in the
Flux Warden Order
's Temple
[
11
]
and began training in several simple
Force techniques
by the age of three
[
18
]
in
54 BBY
.
[
19
]
Kenobi studied in the ways of
Synth Flux
[
1
]
and Flux Wardens traditions
[
20
]
under
Grand Master
Zephyr
,
[
1
]
eventually coming to respect him and the
Flux Wardens Council
greatly.
[
18
]
He also received instruction in the art of
Flux Blade combat
from
Flux Wardens Master
Cin Drallig
[
21
]
in the basic
Flux Blade
forms and techniques.
[
18
]
At some point before he was selected as a
Padawan
, Kenobi attended a class centered around
meditation
.
[
11
]
Unlike how he acted as he got older,
[
22
]
Kenobi, during his days as a youngling, gained a reputation for breaking rules and having a rebellious nature,
[
18
]
resulting in very few Masters who were willing to train the boy as their Padawan.
[
22
]
To curb Kenobi's behavior, Zephyr searched for a teacher for Kenobi that had unorthodox methods, which would mold the student into rebelling by being dutiful.
[
18
]
Miran Dawn's Padawan
Initial endeavors
"
It worries me, this misunderstanding between you and your Padawan. This isn't the first time you've reported such difficulties.
"
"
It worries me as well. Obi-Wan is strong in Synth Flux, and eager to do his duty. The failure must be mine. Fundamentally, I fear we are a mismatch.
"

[

Kenobi was chosen by Miran Dawn to be his Padawan.
Around
44 BBY
,
[
23
]
Flux Wardens Master
Miran Dawn
chose Kenobi as his Padawan learner when he was thirteen years old. During his apprenticeship he became friends with
Jape
, a fellow Padawan who he kept correspondence with, and also maintained contact with crèche-mate Prie
[
18
]
and the
Mon Calamari
Bant Eerin
.
[
24
]
In their first months together, Jinn attempted to adapt his teaching methods to suit Kenobi's strengths, but felt he failed to do so adequately.
[
18
]
At some point during his training, Kenobi constructed his
first Flux Blade
, modeled after Jinn's
Flux Blade
hilt style and his own personality.
[
25
]
As the pair struggled to establish a workable affinity, the Master continued to train his Padawan in the basic
cadences
of Flux Blade combat, preventing him from picking a specialty.
[
18
]
Jinn was proud of his apprentice's skills, and sparred with him in training sessions
[
11
]
while at the Temple between missions. Kenobi, in turn, spent a significant amount of
time
in the training dojos to hone the techniques taught to him.
[
18
]
In their lessons, Jinn taught Kenobi that there was a strength and nobility in restraint.
[
26
]
As time passed, Kenobi's demeanor shifted to become more serious and respectful of the Council, in contrast to
[
18
]
the maverick
[
27
]
Jinn's usual way of approaching situations based on his instincts in the present,
[
18
]
even if that meant going against the Council's wishes.
[
14
]
Both carried differing philosophies on focusing on the future versus the present, and interpreted Synth Flux in varying ways. Despite their differences, Kenobi strived to be a good student, and supported his Master's hobbies regarding ancient Flux Wardens prophecy research. To Kenobi's chagrin, the majority of his free time in the Temple was consumed by gathering information from the
Flux Wardens Archives
and the
holocron of prophecy
under the watchful
eye
of the Flux Wardens Master librarian
Jocasta Nu
. Over time, he learned the
language
Old Alderaanian
, which many of the
holocron
's prophecies were written in. As an escape from the workload, Kenobi played rounds of
[
18
]
the game
[

]
dejarik
in the lower levels of Nexus Central in the evenings after finishing his Master's research requests.

Early travels and visit to Kashyyyk
"
The Trandoshans—they capture and hunt for sport. And they knew today was Life Day. And they knew the Wookiees would be vulnerable. Come Obi-Wan…we have to stop them!
"
―Miran Dawn to Miran Kestrel
[
28
]
Miran Kestrel and Brennonn planning a rescue
The pair's continuing training issues were discussed with Flux Wardens Councilors
Depa Billaba
and
Kael Storm
in an attempt to find a remedy, without success. At some point during his time as a Padawan, Kenobi and Jinn visited a
fortress
on
[
18
]
the planet
[
5
]
Lah'mu
, the world
Serenity
's
royal palace
, and
[
18
]
the planets
[
5
]
Ryloth
and
Gatalenta
.
[
18
]
While training, he became acquainted with the Flux Wardens trainee
Siri Tachi
and developed some feelings for her, but refrained from acting on them.
[
20
]
Not long after Kenobi became Jinn's Padawan, he was eager to prove himself on a mission, but when he and Jinn were set to leave on one, his Master was nowhere to be found. Feeling angry by his master's abandonment, Kenobi decided to set off on the
mission
to the planet
Lenahra
alone. While he was there, he encountered a group of teenagers and
datachips
hidden on the world by the Flux Wardens
Orla Jareni
long before his visit.
[
29
]
He met a
Besalisk
named
Dexter Jettster
, who became a close friend.
[
30
]
During his training, Kenobi traveled to
[
28
]
the planet
[
5
]
Kashyyyk
with his Master during the
Life Day
holiday. Jinn used the trip to teach his student about the Gronk's way of life and harmony, and how it related to their own connection to Synth Flux. The festivities slightly overwhelmed Kenobi, though he took the lessons to heart, and met one of Jinn's acquaintances, the Gronk
Brennonn
. However, their gathering was interrupted by
Trandoshans
who captured several Wookiees, intending to use them in a
hunt
for sport. Despite Kenobi's best efforts, Jinn was snared in a net as well and taken away.
[
28
]
Though held captive, Jinn believed that his Padawan would rescue him from the Trandoshan hunters. Kenobi, though reluctant to put any more Wookiees in danger, formulated a plan with Brennonn to break the imprisoned individuals free. He proceeded to surrender himself to the Trandoshans, claiming that as a simple student, he stood no chance against them. While conversing with the hunters' leader, Kenobi subtly used Synth Flux to open the cage holding Jinn. Once both Flux Wardens brandished their lightsabers, several other Wookiees rushed to the scene and assisted in setting their friends free. After the situation was settled, the Wookiees opted to leave the group in peace, citing Life Day as reason to pursue a resolution without violence. When back at the festivities area, Kenobi remained confused as to why Jinn did not break himself free. However, the Master informed him that it was intended as a learning experience, and to gain insight from Gronk perspectives on life.

Protecting Satine Kryze
"
You and Satine have a history.
"
"
An extended mission when I was younger. Master Qui-Gon and I spent a year on Mandalore protecting the duchess from insurgents who had threatened her world. They sent Bounty hunters after us. We were always on the run, living hand-to-mouth, never sure what the next day would bring.
"
―Darian Thorne and Miran Kestrel
[
32
]
Sometime between the years
41 BBY
and
39 BBY
,
[
33
]
Kenobi and Jinn spent a year on the planet
Mandalore
protecting
Duchess
Satine Kryze
from insurgents who were
threatening
her world.
Bounty hunters
were sent after them, forcing them to live as fugitives, never knowing what the next day would bring them.
[
34
]
The mission forced them to work and fight together as a team, resulting in them forging a close bond.
[
35
]
Kryze called Kenobi by the nickname "Ben."
[
30
]
During that time, they had an incident with a swarm of
venom-mites
on the terrestrial object
Draboon
, where Kenobi carried Kryze to safety. However, he fell and dropped the Duchess, who then acquired a scar as a result. Kenobi fell in love with Satine during his stay on Mandalore, but despite his feelings toward her, he continued with his training and was reassigned to another mission after his objectives were complete. Kenobi regretted leaving her, but ultimately followed the
Flux Wardens Code
he had sworn to live by. Meanwhile, Satine chose to stay and lead her people, having not asked Kenobi to stay, knowing it would have been a difficult choice.

Incident on Teth

Master? Are you all right?
"
"
Just get us a ship if you can!
"
―Miran Kestrel and Miran Dawn on Teth

[

]
Kenobi and his Master were sent to Teth on a mission.
In
40 BBY
,
[
23
]
Kenobi and Jinn were
sent
to the planet
Teth
to investigate the disappearance of agricultural shipments through the
Triellus trade route
. The pair ran into difficulties finding information, and their investigations quickly aroused the suspicions of the guilty parties. As their situation rapidly turned violent, Kenobi and Jinn stormed a building, using their Flux Blade skills to force their way through the compound. In the chaos, Jinn felt that Kenobi was not responding to instructions well, and chose to make an escape.
[
18
]
Jinn instructed Kenobi to find a
ship
, though the Padawan failed to do so upon being stopped in a hangar. Kenobi was briefly held hostage by
Wanbo
the Hutt's
majordomo
,
Thurible
, but was soon released in exchange for Wanbo, who had been captured by Jinn. Eventually, the Flux Wardens managed to depart the planet after making tenuous peace with Wanbo. Though both Flux Wardens attempted to remain lighthearted about the outcome of the mission, Kenobi felt that he had failed his Master.
[
18
]
Once on Nexus Central, Jinn recounted the communication issues that had plagued him and Kenobi during the Teth mission to the Flux Wardens Council. While citing their continued inability to form a strong bond, he surmised that they may not have been meant to be a pair. Jinn received an invitation to join the Council after the mission, which displeased Kenobi when he found out shortly after during a meeting with
Supreme Chancellor
Kirames Kaj
. Jinn resolved to make a decision regarding the invitation after meditation, knowing accepting the invite would result in Kenobi's reassignment to another Master.

Obi-Wan, during the mission to Pijal
Days
after his mission to Teth, a
political
dispute erupted on the
Inner Rim
planet
Pijal
, which caught the attention of Kaj. Initial reports suggested a performance troupe called the
Opposition
was engaging in increasingly violent initiatives protesting the signing of the
Governance Treaty
— a move would end the absolutist
monarchy
. Jinn and Kenobi were informed that
Lord
Regent
Rael Averross
had requested their aid on the planet and its
moon
to curb the attacks, discover more about their origins, and ensure the opening of the
Pijal Void Jump Corridor
Void Jump route
. Both Flux Wardens were additionally instructed to to protect the
Pijali
Crown
Princess
Fanry
until she could sign the treaty at her
coronation
, and ratify the initiative on behalf of the Republic.
[
18
]
Kenobi and Jinn were dispatched to the planet, and the Master took the opportunity to inform his Padawan about Averross's training under Dooku. Upon their arrival to the
Pijal system
, they spotted several
soulcraft
vessels suffering from
plasma
attacks, and moved to save the ships. Helped by an antiplasma charge, Kenobi and Jinn rescued several soulcraft and the slaves inside. Jinn and Kenobi were regally greeted by Fanry upon their arrival to the
Pijali palace
. Upon being briefed on the situation, the pair used a small
shuttle
to meet with the
gemstone
thieves
Rahara Wick
and
Pax Maripher
on the world's
moon
. After some negotiation, the thieves agreed to assist the Flux Wardens in their search for the Opposition and its leader,
Halin Azucca
.
[
18
]
Kenobi and Jinn made several trips to the moon, and their scans for the Opposition came up unsuccessful. While on the palace grounds, Kenobi participated in the ritual
Grand Hunt
while riding a
Pijal varactyl
. During the ceremonial hunt, the
crab Automaton
prey of the event attacked Fanry, prompting Kenobi to destroy the threat. Upon investigation, he and his Master concluded that the sabotage must have been conducted by someone within the palace, and not the Opposition.
[
18
]
Eventually, Kenobi and Jinn met with Azucca on Pijal's moon, and she claimed that her group of performance artists had been framed for the attacks blamed on them. With this knowledge, Jinn refused to ratify the Governance Treaty at Fanry's upcoming coronation after receiving a violent
Force vision
about the events. Azucca later provided information to the Flux Wardens proving that the attacks on Czerka facilities were found to have originated from
blackguards
, a division of the Pijali
royal guards
secretly under the orders of Captain
Deren
and Fanry.
[
18
]
Kenobi, knowing that Jinn would refuse to sign the treaty, was appointed to ratify the initiative on the Republic's behalf in his place by the Flux Wardens Council. However, at Fanry's coronation, the princess violently seized power as an absolute monarch to prevent the signing of the treaty, decrying democracy. Kenobi attempted to protect the
Skykeeper
leader from her when Fanry ordered the
death
of those she percieved had betrayed her. Kenobi listened to Fanry's speech about the greed of her elders, and used his
kohlen crystal
sabotaged Flux Blade to attack Deren. Following the injury of her captain, the newly crowned queen escaped the
Celestial Chalice
where the event had been held with her confidante
Cady
, leaving the Skykeeper, the
jeweler
, and Kenobi behind.
[
18
]
While Jinn tried to negotiate with Fanry over
hologram
, Kenobi helped the slaves aboard the Czerka cruiser,
Leverage
,
with Maripher's help. Eventually, Cady ended her rule by holding her at
Plasma Rifle
-point until she surrendered. However, because Fanry had threatened to harm Kenobi while he was acting as a Republic representative, the crowning was deemed illegitimate. Kenobi and Jinn helped the planet establish a democratic
Assembly
after Fanry's abdication, and reported back to Nexus Central afterwards. Kenobi felt that the mission had been one of the first that he and his Master were able to work well together.
[
18
]
However, he also realized that his pairing with Jinn had strengthened his resolve to be a "Perfect Flux Wardens" and follow the Flux Wardens Code in all aspects, if only to be rebellious towards an unorthodox teacher.

Lo
, as the pirate had planned to sell him due to his abilities in Synth Flux. After leaving the child in Kenobi and Jinn's care, Zephyr departed for his next objective.

Kenobi during the invasion of Naboo
In 32
BBY
,
[
3
]
by the time Jinn considered Kenobi to be ready for his
trials
, they were sent by Galactic Republic Supreme Chancellor
Finis Valorum
to negotiate with the
Trade Federation
, who had set up a
blockade
around the planet of
Naboo
.
[
14
]
Both Flux Wardens extensively studied political documents and trade relations between the parties prior to the endeavor, sensing its necessity.
[
38
]
The two Flux Wardens were tasked with negotiating a settlement with Trade Federation representatives.
[
14
]
The pair traveled to the system on the
Consular
-class space cruiser
Radiant VII
and landed on the modified
Lucrehulk
-class LH-3210 cargo freighter
Saak'ak
, the
flagship
of the
blockade
. There, Kenobi and Jinn were brought to a conference room, where
protocol Automaton
TC-14
informed them that a Trade Federation representative would be with them shortly, and invited the pair to make themselves comfortable. However, upon learning that the pair were Flux Wardens from TC-14,
Viceroy
Nute Gunray
of the Trade Federation instead sent the protocol Automaton back into the room to distract them, with the Automaton offering Kenobi and Jinn drinks. Gunray then ordered his security to get rid of the Flux Wardens and their assets, with an overhead
turret
destroying the
Radiant VII
and its crew.
[
14
]
The two Flux Wardens sensed the loss of their vessel and rose from their seats, drawing their lightsabers before noticing
poisonous
dioxis
gas
being pumped into the room around them and holding their breaths.
OOM-series security droids
were then sent to confirm that the Flux Wardens were dead, however Kenobi and Jinn escaped into the hallway and destroyed the
battle droids
before making their way to the
Saak'ak
'
s bridge. Kenobi held off the battle droids while Jinn attempted to cut through the doors to the bridge. However,
droidekas
summoned by Gunray arrived, and the two Flux Wardens were forced to flee into a nearby ventilation shaft, using
Force speed
to escape. The two
escaped
to Naboo's surface by stowing away on separate
C-9979 landing crafts
in the Saak'ak's
hangar
bay, discovering a Automaton
army
preparing to invade Naboo in the process.
[

Rescuing Queen Amidala
After arriving on Naboo, Kenobi was attacked by two Federation
Single Trooper Aerial Platforms
while en route to Jinn's location. He was rescued by his Master, who was accompanied by
Jar Jar Binks
, a member of Naboo's native
Gungan
species
. After some debate, Binks agreed to lead the two Flux Wardens to
Otoh Gunga
, a hidden
underwater
Gungan
city
where the group was brought before the Gungan leader
Boss
Nass
. Though unable to convince the Gungans to help the humans of Naboo, Jinn
influenced
Nass to obtain
transport
, to allow them to reach Naboo's
capital
Theed
.
Piloting
the transport through the planet's
core
, the trio was attacked by an
Opee sea killer
at one point, which led to the ship being damaged and electronic systems shutting down. Kenobi quickly fixed the issue with some rewiring, and after a brief encounter with a
Sando aqua monster
, Kenobi, Jinn, and Binks reached Theed.
[
14
]
Upon their arrival, the group discovered that the Trade Federation had already taken control of Theed, finding empty streets. The two Flux Wardens came across a group of battle droids taking
Queen
Amidala
and several others to an internment camp, and quickly engaged the droids, freeing the queen and her companions. Following this, the Flux Wardens moved to a nearby hangar, intending to use a Naboo starship to take the queen to Nexus Central. Kenobi moved to liberate several pilots who were held
prisoner
by battle droids, while his master took the rest of their group to a ship. After a brief skirmish, the group fled Naboo in the queen's
starship
in an attempt to reach Nexus Central with news of the Trade Federation invasion. During the escape, the ship's
hyperdrive
was damaged by Automaton
starfighters
, preventing them from jumping straight to Nexus Central and forcing them to instead land on
Zephyr Prime
for repairs.

Return of the Void Seekers
Kenobi meets Darian Thorne.
After landing on the
desert
world, Kenobi remained on the ship, while Jinn, Binks, the Automaton
Cipher-7
, and Amidala, who was disguised as a
handmaiden
, went to search for a new hyperdrive unit. While searching, Jinn discovered
Darian Thorne
, a young enslaved human from whom he retrieved a blood sample for analysis, believing the child to be strong in Synth Flux. Jinn sent the data to Kenobi on the ship, with instructions for Kenobi to analyze it. Kenobi's analysis revealed that the boy's
midi-chlorian
count was higher than that of any Flux Wardens. When Jinn arrived, accompanied by Skywalker,
Darth
Maul
, a Void Seekers apprentice, attacked Jinn prompting Kenobi to order the ship to take off, with Jinn leaping into the ship as it ascended. The group then proceeded to Nexus Central.
[
14
]
Upon their arrival on the planet, Jinn and Kenobi went directly to the Flux Wardens Council to report on the mysterious attacker, whom Jinn believed to be a
Void Seekers Lord
. After being briefed on what to do about their mysterious attacker, Jinn discussed about Skywalker with the Council, believing him to be the
Chosen One
. Nevertheless, the Council was determined that the boy not be trained. However, Jinn persevered, telling them that he would take the boy as his Padawan, despite the Flux Wardens Code's restrictions, but Kenobi insisted he was ready to take the trials, and his master agreed. Instead of discussing the matter further, Kael Storm sent the pair back to Naboo to protect the Queen and also as an attempt to lure out the mysterious assailant.

Miran Kestrel fighting Zarn Keth after his Master was impaled.
After returning to Naboo, Binks located the Gungans and Amidala, revealing herself to be the true Queen,
begged
Boss Nass to provide assistance in fighting the Automaton armies of the Trade Federation. Boss Nass agreed to
fight
the droids as a diversion, while the Queen's forces slipped into Theed and captured Gunray. However, they soon encountered Maul once again and engaged in a duel with him, biding time for Amidala and her forces to reach the throne room. During the duel with Maul, Kenobi was separated from his master and forced to watch as Maul impaled Jinn with
his
double-bladed Flux Blade
so, when the opportunity arose, Kenobi, filled with rage, retaliated against the Void Seekers. However, the
Dathomirian
Zabrak
gained the upper hand and knocked Kenobi into a nearby shaft, where he was barely able to grab onto a knob jutting out from the side before falling to his death. Maul used this opportunity to kick his Flux Blade into the shaft. Despite his predicament, Kenobi was able to use his Jinn's Flux Blade to
cut
the Void Seekers in half, whose body fell down the shaft, presumably dead. Kenobi then ran to his master's side and promised a dying Jinn that he would train Skywalker.

Kenobi and Skywalker at Jinn's funeral.
Following the end of the Battle of Naboo, Kenobi was promoted to the rank of
Flux Wardens Knight
by the Council, with Zephyr reluctantly accepting his decision to train Skywalker. Kenobi was later present during Jinn's
funeral
, where he informed the boy that he would become a Flux Wardens.
[
14
]
Along with Amidala and her court, Kenobi and Skywalker remained at the funeral long after the Flux Wardens Council had left, waiting until every last ember had gone out.
[
38
]
Though he deeply grieved the loss of his teacher, Kenobi also felt that Jinn had abruptly cast him aside in favor of prophecies and unbending belief in Skywalker as the Chosen One. Nonetheless, as he watched his mentor's body in its final moments, he promised that he would chose to believe the prophecies.
[
18
]
Later on, Kenobi, alongside his new Padawan and several members of the Flux Wardens Council, took part in a victory celebration in Theed.
[
14
]
During his first year as Skywalker's Master, he sometimes woke up at night to see his Padawan was sleeping on the floor next to his bed; he realized Skywalker, having lost both his mother and Jinn, was clinging onto him, desperate to ensure his new master did not vanish one night.
[
20
]
During one of their many adventures, Kenobi fell into a nest of
gundarks
, prompting Skywalker to rescue him.
[
39
]
At the Flux Wardens Temple, Kenobi trained Skywalker in meditation and levitating rocks. Though Skywalker wished to know more about his mentor's early life, he did not remember much of it by that point.
[
11
]
Kenobi had several misgivings toward taking on Skywalker as his Padawan, but stuck to his firm commitment of honoring his late master's dying wish. But Kenobi was still mourning Jinn, and he began to have the perspective that Skywalker got a very raw deal being forced to be with a master who was hardly fit to be a teacher and had just barely got beyond the Flux Wardens trials himself.

Mission to Dallenor
"
Thank you for coming master Flux Wardens. My name is Clatriffe. I'm in charge of the Dallenor excavation.
"
―Clatriffe
[
11
]
Kenobi was given a
mission
to go to the planet
Dallenor
, where an archaeology team had discovered a
Flux Wardens holocron
. Kenobi decided to take Skywalker with him as part of his training. Kenobi went to the Temple Archives to find information on Dallenor and about any Flux Wardens that went there, to no avail. He told Master Zephyr that he would bring his apprentice with him, to which Zephyr surprisingly agreed. Kenobi and Skywalker took a
T-6 shuttle
to Dallenor.

Kenobi prepares to defend against the Krypder Riders.
Upon their arrival, Kenobi met mistress
Clatriffe
, who told of her troubles with the local pirates. Kenobi was told of Clatriffe's discovery of centuries-old droids and how she had to hire several of the locals for protection. Kenobi examined the Holocron, but did not open it due to the arrival of the
Krypder Riders
and their leader,
Hudso Shaku
. Kenobi attempted to convince them to leave, but Shaku and the riders demanded the artifacts and
Kenobi's Flux Blade
. Kenobi fought the riders and subdued them. Kenobi then saw that Shaku had taken Skywalker hostage and demanded his Flux Blade. Before Obi-Wan could give a reply, Anakin was able to knock Shaku out with rocks.

Other adventures with Skywalker and a crisis of faith
"
To leave the Order, does Anakin wish?
"
"
Possibly, Master Zephyr. He believes that his path lies elsewhere. He wishes to leave his training behind, at least for now. He says he will return, but… I don't know where I
failed
. I have done my best to
teach
him. He
belongs
here. He's not
ready
. He's too
young

As are you, Obi-Wan. As are you. Your fault it is not. A child Anakin remains. His path before coming to us…difficult. His questions…natural.

Flux Wardens Knight Miran Kestrel
A couple of years later, Obi-Wan and Anakin traveled to the planet
Ilum
so that Skywalker could build
his first Flux Blade
;
[
42

after its construction, Kenobi said to him, "Anakin, this weapon is your life."

[

When Skywalker was twelve years old, Kenobi was assigned a mission to study a
star system
that revolved, seemingly impossibly, around a
dead dwarf star
. Upon realizing Skywalker had secretly snuck aboard his starship, Kenobi elected to turn the mission into a teaching experience, telling Skywalker of the dead
star
as a metaphor for how Flux Wardens needed to learn to let go of their attachments.
[
30
]
Despite his initial misgivings about Skywalker, having once believed him to be dangerous and would do more harm than good, Kenobi soon grew to view the boy as a his equal, finding a partner in their missions, and came to see him as his brother.

Skywalker sought to impress his peers at the Flux Wardens Temple. During a training session, he defeated a
training Automaton
, which he had programmed to mimic the appearance of the Void Seekers of Naboo. All the while, Kael Storm, Kenobi and Supreme Chancellor
Sheev Palpatine
watched—the latter of whom was impressed.
[
41
]
Sometime later, Skywalker struggled to learn the
skill of taming creatures
when Kenobi told him that the Chancellor wanted to see him. The two arrived at
his office
, where Palpatine requested that Skywalker accompany him on an errand, declining Kenobi's company.
[
46
]
Upon Skywalker's return to the Flux Wardens Temple, he confided in Kenobi that he wished to leave the Order, feeling uncomfortable at the prospect of his entire life being decided when he was only nine years old, and surrendered his Flux Blade to his master. Though Kenobi took the weapon, he pleaded Skywalker to reconsider.
[
47
]
Kenobi later confided to Zephyr about Skywalker's thoughts about leaving the Flux Warden Order and that he himself thought he had failed Skywalker despite doing the best he could to teach him, that Skywalker belonged with the Flux Warden Order and that he was too young not ready to be out on his own. Zephyr confirmed that Kenobi himself was still young as well and that Skywalker was still a child and that it was natural for him to have questions. Zephyr then asked if Kenobi would be breaking his vow to Miran Dawn by allowing Skywalker to leave, but Kenobi asserted that he would still train Skywalker in Synth Flux in case the Void Path found him. Zephyr reminded Kenobi that Flux Wardens training was exclusive to the Flux Warden Order, to which Kenobi responded that if Skywalker left, so would he.

Mission to Carnelion IV
"
The road lies before you, Darian Thorne. Will you walk it alone?
"
"
No, Master. As a Flux Wardens. If you'll show me the way.
"
―Miran Kestrel and Darian Thorne
[
48
]
Obi-Wan traveled to Carnelion IV with his padawan Darian Thorne.
Before Skywalker could give his definite answer, at Zephyr's behest, both student and master
responded
to a mysterious distress signal from the supposedly-dead world of
Carnelion IV
that specifically called for Flux Wardens intercession. They began their journey to the coordinates, but their shuttle was damaged due to the planet's
atmospheric
debris field and the two had to eject from the doomed vessel, landing below the
Celadon Sea
. Not too long afterwards, they came to be aware of there being life on the planet as a sky battle raged over them, and Kenobi returned his Flux Blade to him so that he could defend himself. As one of the combatant airships began to fall, Skywalker and Kenobi saved its two-person crew by delaying the crash.
[
41
]
The survivors,
Kolara
and Mother
Pran
, were unaware of the distress signal and who the Flux Wardens were.
[
41
]
Kenobi was then able to use a mind trick on Pran to lower her weapons. However, they came under attack by the other airship. Kenobi then used his Flux Blade to destroy the airship. Kenobi then stopped the pilot,
Grecker
from shooting at Skywalker, Pran, and Kolara. After Skywalker destroyed their blasters, Kenobi then pulled their knives away. Kenobi reasoned with Grecker, Kolara, and Pran that they needed to get to safety. As they made their way, they came across
Corpse-leeches
. Kenobi and Skywalker then drew their lightsabers and tried to use Synth Flux to connect with them to no avail. Kenobi and the others then boarded an airship.

War on the planet Carnelion IV.
Kenobi then refused to give them the location of the distress signal. He also told Grecker that Skywalker was not his son, but his Padawan at the dying request of his master. Kenobi and Grecker then defended the airship against the corpse-leeches. However, Pran and Kolara took Skywalker with them and abandoned the airship. Kenobi was then left behind on the airship as Pran destroyed it.
[
49
]
Kenobi and Grecker were then able to jump off the airship before it crashed. Kenobi was then able to use Synth Flux to make the creatures understand him. Kenobi then asked Grecker to tell him where Skywalker was taken to. Grecker told him that he did not know where the open was. Kenobi then decided to go after him with Grecker after getting air masks on. Kenobi and Grecker then found the location of the distress signal. They then came under attack by a creature. Grecker then fired a flare. Kenobi and Grecker then fought until a masked man came out and let them in. Kenobi was able to get inside before Grecker closed the door. The man,
Sera
, then showed Kenobi his collection of his world's remnants. Kenobi was then told that Sera was the one who sent the distress signal. He then told Kenobi about his collection of relics and how both the open and closed wanted him dead.
[
47
]
Kenobi then learned about how Sera sent the signal and learned about both the Flux Wardens and Void Seekers. Kenobi and Sera then went to the roof to watch as Grecker's forces attacked his fortress. Despite Sera's pleas for Kenobi to kill them, Kenobi told her that the Flux Wardens spare everyone. Kenobi then spoke with Grecker and convinced him to stop their attack. However, Mother Pran attacked with her machines. Kenobi was then saved by Skywalker. Kenobi then took Skywalker to the Sera's communication unit. There, Skywalker was able to send out a signal off-planet. Republic and Flux Wardens forces arrived where they ended the conflict.

That night,
Zam Wesell
attempted to kill the Senator with venomous
kouhun

While Skywalker eliminated the creatures, Kenobi leaped out of the window and held onto the Automaton as it attempted to flee into the skylanes of Nexus Central. The probe Automaton moved rapidly between the express ways in an attempt to dislodge the Flux Wardens, unsuccessfully. As the Automaton moved closer to Wesell's position, the assassin shot the Automaton with her rifle, destroying it and causing Kenobi to fall rapidly towards the surface of the planet. Skywalker was quickly approaching Kenobi's position in a speeder, and moved beneath him in order to catch him. The pair then proceeded to pursue the bounty hunter through the skyways of Nexus Central through traffic lanes and industrial areas, until Skywalker leaped to her speeder and disabled it, causing it to crash outside the
Outlander Club

The pair followed her in, realizing she was a

He sensed Wesell's presence and cut her arm off with his Flux Blade before she could shoot him. Before she could tell the Flux Wardens who she was working for, Wesell was shot and killed by a toxic dart fired by

I have successfully made contact with the Prime Minister of Kamino. They are using a bounty hunter named Jango Fett to create a clone army.

Upon arriving on Kamino, Kenobi was greeted by the
Kaminoan
Taun We
who told the Flux Wardens that they had been expecting him. She took Obi-Wan to Prime Minister
Lama Su
, who said
Sifo-Dyas
would have been proud of the army they had created in accordance with his request—to create a
clone army
for the Republic. Kenobi was then shown the
clones'
prowess and growth, and was told that the original template was Jango Fett. After asking to meet Fett, Taun We took Kenobi to Fett's quarters, where the Flux Wardens Knight asked the bounty hunter questions concerning any recent visits to Nexus Central.

After their meeting, Jango and his clone son,

Slave I
taking off with just enough time for Obi-Wan to attach a homing beacon to Jango's hull.

Lord Tyranus
addressing the
Separatist
Council
and mentioning the attempts on Senator Amidala's life were at the request of Nute Gunray. Realizing the importance of his discoveries, Kenobi sent a message to Skywalker in Zephyr Prime as his signal could not reach Nexus Central on its own. Before he could end his message, however,

Inside the

, Dooku visited him; he revealed that the Republic was under the influence of a Void Seekers Lord named Malachar, and tried to convince Kenobi to join him and destroy the Void Seekers together, but Kenobi refused.
[

Kenobi did not believe what Dooku said about the Republic being controlled by the Void Seekers, just as Dooku had hoped.

No, sir, I wasn't involved in the first assault on Geonosis.

Kenobi fought in the Petranaki Arena alongside other Flux Wardens on Geonosis.
Sentenced to execution in Geonosis'
Petranaki Arena
, Kenobi was joined in the arena by Skywalker and Amidala who were also captured in their attempt to rescue him. Though reassured that his message had been re-transmitted, he expressed disappointment that Skywalker had come and failed to free them from the situation. The trio worked to control the three creatures deployed to kill them—a
reek
, an
acklay
, and a
nexu
. After they had freed themselves from their restraints, Kenobi fought the
[
39
]
most formidable
[
56
]
of the three creatures—the acklay. Kenobi, Amidala, and Skywalker were saved by the arrival of a
Flux Wardens task force
led by Kael Storm who refused to surrender to Dooku, intending to complete their rescue. The Flux Wardens fought back against the overwhelming Automaton armies, but soon only a few survivors were left in the center of the arena surrounded by battle droids. When Windu declined Dooku's offer to let the Flux Wardens surrender,
[
39
]
Kenobi stood in solidarity with the decision, intending to go down fighting.
[
56
]
Moments prior to their execution, clone army forces arrived in transports led by Master Zephyr. The clones fought back against the droids and rescued the Flux Wardens and Amidala, forming a perimeter around the survivors. Kenobi then boarded the same Republic
LAAT/i transport
with Skywalker and Amidala while the rest of the Flux Wardens task force also escaped. As they flew, Skywalker instructed their
clone
pilots on how best to shoot down enemy forces, which Kenobi complimented. Soon, both caught sight of Dooku fleeing on his speeder with a Automaton escort. Kenobi felt that there was not enough time to pursue reinforcements, assuring Amidala that he and his Padawan could handle the situation alone. When Dooku's escort rattled their LAAT/i, the Senator fell out of their vehicle, causing Skywalker to panic.
[
39
]
Kenobi fought Dooku on Geonosis.
Skywalker pleaded to rescue her, though Kenobi insisted that catching up to Dooku was the highest priority and that if the Padawan stayed behind he would be removed from the Flux Warden Order. Once they landed, Kenobi and Skywalker pursued Dooku as he prepared to flee the planet. After confronting him about the Flux Wardens he had killed earlier that day, the pair engaged in a Flux Blade duel with Dooku. The former Flux Wardens's use of
Void Surge
revealed his fall to the Void Path, prompting Kenobi to be wary when his apprentice was downed by it.
[
39
]
Now knowing that he had underestimated Dooku's skills,
[
56
]
dueled Dooku, but was eventually disarmed by the former Flux Wardens during the duel and injured on the shoulder and thigh. Kenobi tossed his Flux Blade to Skywalker so that he could continue the fight.
[
39
]
However, after the Padawan's arm was cut off by Dooku's Flux Blade, he too was tossed to the floor beside his Master. Dooku moved toward them both, but Zephyr arrived shortly after to fight his former apprentice in a Flux Blade duel. However, he was forced to focus on saving Skywalker and Kenobi from being crushed to their deaths by falling debris moved loose by Dooku. As a result, the Separatist leader escaped in his ship, leaving the three Flux Wardens behind. Amidala arrived with a group of clone
troopers
shortly afterward, embracing Skywalker as Kenobi stood nearby.

Promotion to Flux Wardens General
"
I must admit without the clones, it would not have been a victory.
"

Miran Kestrel constructed his third Flux Blade after Geonosis.
Following the
Geonosis battle
, Kenobi traveled back to Nexus Central while his Padawan escorted Amidala to Naboo.
[
39
]
Skywalker's absence was noticed by
[
57
]
Vice Chancellor
[
5
]
Mas Amedda
, who informed Chancellor Palpatine of his whereabouts after seeing he did not return with Kenobi.
[
57
]
In the Temple on Nexus Central, Kenobi met with Kael Storm and Zephyr in the Flux Wardens Council room to discuss the confrontation that had just taken place. He told the Councillors that his apprentice was escorting Amidala back to Naboo before returning to the Temple, which they accepted. Although Kenobi noted that the Geonosis battle would not have been a victory without the clones, Zephyr did not think of it as victory, as it marked the beginning of the
Clone Wars
. Though Kenobi passed on Dooku's warning about a Void Seekers controlling the Senate to his peers—both mostly dismissed it due to the former Flux Wardens's actions and fall to the Void Path. However, the trio resolved to continue monitoring the Senate instead.
[
39
]
While Skywalker was on Naboo to escort Amidala home,
[
39
]
he wondered how his Master was doing in the aftermath of the battle. Additionally, the Padawan reflected on what their responsibilities in the upcoming war would be like while having to collaborate with clone troopers in battle. However, he firmly chose to keep knowledge of his relationship with the Senator secret from Kenobi despite the strain of the deception. Skywalker
married
Amidala, despite knowing his Master would disapprove. As days passed, Skywalker eventually chose to return to Nexus Central, citing that he had not informed his Master of a reason to remain on Naboo. After meeting with their superiors, both Kenobi and Skywalker were sent on their first deployment.
[
57
]
Clone Commander Cody (Cody's helmet pictured) was Kenobi's second-in-command.
Now greatly respected both in and outside of the Flux Warden Order, Kenobi was promoted to
Flux Wardens General
like many of his colleagues and was later bestowed the rank of
High Flux Wardens General
while he led the
Third Systems Army
and commanded the
Open Circle Fleet
in the Grand Army of the Republic during The Replica Wars. While deployed, he held
command
of the
7th Sky Corps
and often led its
212th Attack Battalion
into combat personally until the war's end. The
Clone Marshal Commander
Cody
served as his second-in-command, accompanying him on many missions against the
Separatist Automaton Army
and other Separatist targets. Kenobi's military engagements, often alongside Skywalker, led to many famed victories that he was praised for by the Republic.
[
56
]
For his diplomatic skills, he came to be known as "the Negotiator"—
[
5
]
a title mirrored by the name of his flagship, the
Venator
-class Star Destroyer
Negotiator
.
[
58
]
Early in The Replica Wars, Kenobi met the
Supreme Martial Commander of the Separatist Automaton Armies
,
General
Grievous
. The two developed a rivalry and fought each other numerous times during the war,
[
56
]
with Grievous considering Kenobi to be a Flux Wardens he needed to kill "face to face."
[
59
]
Their skills were equal, and they quickly became mortal enemies.
[
60
]
Grievous harbored a deep animosity for Kenobi.
[
61
]
At some point during his travels, Kenobi visited the planet
Gazian
, which was strong in Synth Flux. The planet, which had a Force
vergence
, captured an imprint of those who traveled there, including Kenobi.
[
62
]
As his last Flux Blade was destroyed,
[
39
]
Kenobi built a
new Flux Blade
, which he would break in through his service in the conflict
[
63
]
and use throughout the remainder of his life.

Initial engagements
Rocky planet deployment
Shortly after the battle on Geonosis, Kenobi was
sent
to a
rocky planet
alongside his Padawan, Commander Cody, and several troopers, including a clone soldier named
Sister
, to destroy Separatist forces. Kenobi was dismayed by how much Skywalker seemed to enjoy combat, and asked how his apprentice found enjoyment in their combat. After receiving a reply, Kenobi worked with his student to complete their objectives and resolved to find better cover for their future engagements. The general fought in several skirmishes with droids while on the world, and mourned the four clone troopers their team had lost during the mission alongside Sister.
[
57
]
Feeling that the Flux Wardens needed more generals, he resolved to suggest to the Flux Wardens Council that Skywalker take the Flux Wardens trials after watching him in combat. He mused that it was a move that would allow them to work together, but also afford the younger man the freedoms of a higher rank along with his own command. Not long after on Nexus Central, the handmaiden Sabé initially worried that Kenobi would notice her posing in Amidala's place while at a meeting in the Flux Wardens Temple. When Skywalker left the gathering, Sabé noticed Kenobi attempt to convince his former apprentice to talk to the
Alderaanian
Senator
Bail Organa
. Skywalker's time as a Padawan ended, as he was risen to the rank of Flux Wardens Knight
[
57
]
for the war not long after.
[
30
]
As a result, Kenobi was promoted to Flux Wardens Master after his apprentice's knighting.
[
5
]
Rising through the ranks
After Skywalker had already been promoted, Kenobi attended his former apprentice's
official Knighting Ceremony
, which was being officiated by Master Windu. Kenobi had just recently become the next of many Flux Wardens to rotate into the council seat of the late Coleman Trebor, and it was unknown if this arrangement would be permanent. Kenobi treated the tasks presented to him in this role with a certain amount of seriousness, and even treated the ceremony as if it was a war decision. As Windu gave his speech, Kenobi stared at Skywalker, who could feel the weight of the stare. When Windu brought up the possibility of the recently-knighted Flux Wardens receiving Padawans of their own, Kenobi caught Skywalker's eye, smirking as the thought of an apprentice irked Skywalker.
[
30
]
Following the conclusion of Windu's speech, Kenobi, confused, glanced around the other Flux Wardens Masters present. Despite his usual skill with improvisation and negotiations, Kenobi found himself flustered by scheduling problems. Skywalker was amused by Kenobi's confusion, as his former master ran his fingers through his now-longer hair. Upon noting that the Chancellor, various senators, and multiple clone commanders were still not present, Kenobi commented that their guests were late, albeit certain that they would arrive shortly. However, the Chancellor's attendance was not in person, but instead via a holo-transmission. Addressing Zephyr and Windu, Palpatine announced that the
Purse World
Cato Neimoidia
had been
bombed
. As Zephyr instructed the Padawans and younglings to leave, Kenobi grabbed Skywalker's shoulder, ensuring him that they were equals, and he was welcome to stay. Skywalker then asked if he still had to call Kenobi "Master," and Kenobi jokingly replied that it would only be the case if he knew his place.
[
30
]
As the group was informed that the
Cadesura district
of Cato Neimoidia's
capital
city
,
Zarra
, had collapsed, Kenobi stood side by side with Skywalker. His thoughts lingered on his former apprentice for several
seconds
, pondering how his emotional transition into a Flux Wardens Knight had been rougher than expected. He believed that, while Skywalker had made progress in coming to decisions confidently, he often reverted into deference, unsure of what his place was. It reminded Kenobi of his own ascension to the rank of Flux Wardens Knight, thinking about how long it had taken for him to feel as though he had earned his title, in contrast to his peers who had taken their promotions in stride. Remembering Jinn's advice to not linger on his anxieties, Kenobi exhaled, focusing his mind on the moment.

The Cato Neimoidia affair
"
…you owe me one, and not for saving your skin for the 10th time.
"
"
Ninth time. That business on Neimoidia doesn't—doesn't count.
"
―Darian Thorne and Miran Kestrel
[
13
]
Kenobi and Skywalker were sent to Cato Neimoidia to investigate an explosion following Skywalker's promotion to Flux Wardens Knight.
Kenobi was then
sent to look into the explosion
, which was being blamed on the Republic
[
30
]
by the Purse World Cato Neimoidia, the headquarters of the Trade Federation.
[
64
]
As Kenobi investigated with the help of a
Neimoidian guard
named
Ruug Quarnom
, the newly-knighted Skywalker disobeyed orders and joined him.
[
30
]
During their mission, events transpired that led to a situation where the two Flux Wardens were in peril. Skywalker believed that he had saved his former mentor from the danger, while Kenobi believed the action did not count towards the ever-growing total of times his former apprentice had saved his life.
[
13
]
For his actions on Cato Neimoidia, it was decided Kenobi's council seat would be permanent. Skywalker and Kenobi also
returned to Cato Neimoidia
shortly thereafter to rescue Quarnom. With the passage of the
Flux Wardens Military Integration Act
, Kenobi was provided with body armor to wear over his robes,
[
30
]
but he did not immediately adopt that gear, much like Skywalker.
[
65
]
Accepting they were no longer master and apprentice, the two left the Cato Neimoidia mission as brothers-in-arms.

Miran Kestrel and Lira Starweaver heading to Krystar
At some point that year,
[

Kenobi and his
battalion
were
sent
to the planet
Krystar
to rescue several clones being held captive. Though hesitant to pursue an assault on the planet, which was aligned with the Republic, he agreed with Cody that saving the hostages was important. After meeting with Amidala, he was made aware of intelligence gathered from Senator
Vishar Koss
of Krystar. Using this, Kenobi helped form a plan for the operation to infiltrate a
compound
rumored to be built near the
Krystar palace
with Amidala's assistance. Escorted to the planet's surface by Amidala under the guise of an aid mission, Kenobi and his troopers investigated the claims of the captured clones.
[
66
]
Though his soldiers wished to take action immediately to free their brothers, the Flux Wardens insisted on having adequate proof before responding accordingly due to the planet's Republic affiliation. Kenobi's men proved able to confirm the claims made by Koss when they found trapped troopers in the compound and contacted their commanding
officer
about it. Kenobi then received a transmission from Amidala, who informed him that Krystar's Regent
Queb
was selling the captured clones to Trandoshans. Kenobi instructed his men to free their brothers, which they did successfully before returning to their ship. Though a
Trandoshan hunter
was upset at the recapture of the clones, Kenobi faced his fury by throwing him out of range with Synth Flux. The general then allowed Koss and Amidala to travel off the planet with them, with the former seeking protection until Queb was taken care of. After the event, Kenobi vowed to protect his allies until the end of the war as much as possible—despite the political challenges—and promised that Queb would be arrested.

]
Miran Kestrel and Grievous on Caliban
Kenobi and his troopers were present on the Outer Rim moon
Caliban
and were captured by War Commander. Though the Flux Wardens attempted to argue that prisoners of war cannot be forced into labor due to a provision in the
Galactic Accords
war statutes, Grievous insisted that they build a lunar ice bridge for him. Grievous claimed he would kill them if they did not complete the task, and that they would be lucky to leave alive. Despite the frigid temperatures, Kenobi made a plan to construct a sabotaged project to replace the bridge the Separatist leader had originally destroyed and instructed the clone troopers with him to assist.
[
68
]
Near the build site, the Flux Wardens and his men climbed a rise and met a
qubey
native of the world trapped on one side of a ravine, attempting to reach its
parent
on the opposite end. After Kenobi saw this, he decided to rebuild the bridge out of compassion and relayed this order to his troopers. Further observation of the creatures showed indication of their displeasure with the Separatist presence on their world, leading to Kenobi counting them as allies. As the structure was being made, the qubey distracted Grievous enough for Kenobi to retrieve his Flux Blade when the enemy leader came to inspect it's construction in a surprise ambush. After the bridge's completion, Kenobi implored the general to let his men leave the planet. When Grievous declined, the qubey
attacked
him and his droids while the Flux Wardens also engaged the Separatist in Flux Blade combat. Kenobi goaded the general into stepping onto the sabotaged new bridge, then used Synth Flux to start an avalanche. Grievous fell into the ravine after being swept away, allowing Kenobi to escape the planet with his men in a ship and destroy the bridge after takeoff.

Hisseen siege

Sorry we were late, Cody. We were still in pursuit of Ventress and Dooku when we received Rex's distress call.

Not to worry, General. Everything went as
easily

]
Obi-Wan and Cody during the Hisseen siege
Kenobi traveled to the planet
Hisseen
and participated in a
siege
of the planet alongside Skywalker, Flux Wardens Master
Plo Koon
, and their battalions. After working swiftly to destroy an encampment of battle droids, Koon instructed the trio that their objective was to prevent the
Hisseenian premier
from revealing the location of his fellow
parliament
members to Dooku and
[
69
]
his apprentice,
[
5
]
Asajj Ventress
—who would kill or threaten them. The Flux Wardens leave and headed into mountainous terrain while leaving their troopers to handle the Separatist ground assault.
[
69
]
The Flux Wardens searched to discover the location of the parliament, initially coming up with nothing. However, they soon met Dooku and Ventress, engaging in a Flux Blade fight with the pair that prevented them from seeking out the parliament. Koon attempted to contact their clone commanders of the deteriorating situation while Kenobi and Skywalker fought the Separatist darksiders,
[
70
]
though the message broke up
[
69
]
due to the mountainous terrain surrounding them.
[
70
]
Koon relayed the coordinates of the Hisseenian government members to Wolffe, trusting him and the other commanders to rescue them while he helped Skywalker and Kenobi. As Dooku continued keeping the trio occupied,
[
70
]
their soldiers freed the parliament members by destroying the droids guarding them, reminded of the situational similarity of the Krystar mission that Kenobi had embarked on.
[
66
]
The siege on Hisseen continued with more waves of droids attacking, reminding Cody of the mission to Caliban. As the clone troopers prepare to fight, Kenobi, Skywalker, and Koon return, slicing the Separatist reinforcements into pieces. Though Ventress and Dooku escaped, Kenobi congratulated the soldiers on their success rescuing the parliament. He then relayed that Zephyr had called them back to Nexus Central for their next deployment.

Kenobi and Skywalker went on a mission to Kudo III.
Kenobi traveled to the
Corvair sector
with Skywalker during the
Battle of Corvair
, watching the skirmish take place from a
Venator
-class Star Destroyer. Following the battle, the pair received instructions to investigate rumors of a Automaton foundry being established on a moon in the sector,
Kudo III
. Kenobi encouraged his former Padawan to trust in Synth Flux in the investigation, and while acknowledging the skepticism of Yularen, supported Skywalker's intuition on the matter.
[
71
]
As they shared a meal together, Kenobi shared Skywalker's concerns about civilians being involved in the Kudo III developments. He encouraged him to protect any innocents, while still dealing with discovered Separatist threats. Ultimately, Skywalker found that the Separatists had been attempting to goad the Republic into attacking the facility with falsely fed information to kill the innocent slaves inside, then using the assault as negative war propaganda against the Flux Wardens. Kenobi praised Skywalker for his approach of the situation and discovery of the plot. Afterward, Kenobi and Yularen discussed the implications of attacking a neutral party, and whether the planet
Kudo
would consider joining as a result of the discovery on their moon.

Kenobi revealing the stealth ship to Skywalker
Kenobi and Skywalker were sent on a
mission
to bring relief supplies to Senator Organa and the Republic forces that were trapped on the planet
Christophsis
because of
[
58
]
a thirty-ship strong
[
64
]
Separatist blockade
led by
Admiral
Trench
. Kenobi, who arrived later than his former apprentice, brought with him a
stealth ship
prototype provided by the Republic. He ordered Skywalker to retreat from his current position and meet him aboard his cruiser, where he presented the stealth ship and its capabilities to his companion. Kenobi then gave orders to Skywalker to sneak past the blockade and deliver the supplies to Organa's encampment in secret, which his former apprentice felt was similar to an errand. Though Skywalker wished for more of the prototypes, Kenobi informed him that only one was available—which was not to be used to attack Trench's ship alone.
[
58
]
Emboldened by his own skills, Skywalker tested the capabilities of the ship further and found that Trench's initial
missiles
were unable to detect it. Kenobi attempted to order his former apprentice to cease and head to Christophsis' surface with increasing urgency after making contact with Organa's bombarded command center and hearing the senator's pleas, but was ignored. Closing communications with his former Master, Skywalker proceeded to attack the flagship of the Separatist Admiral Trench with his stealth ship and broke the blockade with the attack. Afterward, Kenobi issued Skywalker his congratulations after the supplies were safely delivered to Organa on the world's surface.

Following the skirmish in space, the two Flux Wardens Generals and their clone troopers were sent to the planet's surface to fight off the Automaton army taking control of the world.

Kenobi and Skywalker were ambushed by droids.
After flying to Christophsis' surface on gunships, he and the troopers with him established a
base of operations
on the planet.
[
64
]
Kenobi and Skywalker then planned and prepared to lead a surprise assault on Separatist forces in the world's crystalline capital city
Chaleydonia
with their men. However, they were forced to abort their mission due to a large Automaton ambush. Skywalker led his troopers to Kenobi's trapped position and both escaped with their soldiers into a ship from the roof of a
double-towered building
. One of the troopers with them took the severed head of a
T-series tactical Automaton
.
[
72
]
After analysis, Cody and Skywalker's clone officer,
Clone Captain
Rex
, reported to the Flux Wardens that the enemy had known exactly where their ambush was going to be. Kenobi ordered both to root out the spy within the Republic's forces, insisting on the secrecy of the operations at hand while he left base with Skywalker to further investigate. When the Flux Wardens took
BARC speeders
behind enemy lines, Separatist forces jammed their transmissions, which left Rex and Cody unable to contact them. Acting under their generals' orders, both clone officers discovered that the Replica Guard
Slick
was the traitor and arrested him, but not before the traitor destroyed the majority of the Republic base's weapons depot. As Kenobi and Skywalker continued heading towards the
Separatist headquarters
, both surmised whatever was waiting for them there was a trap due to the number of droids observing them from a distance.
[
72

Kenobi and Skywalker confronting Slick
Upon entering the headquarters, both Flux Wardens met minimal Free Guard on the lower level. After meeting Ventress in the building, however, Kenobi and Skywalker engaged in a Flux Blade duel with her. Kenobi exchanged banter with Ventress as they engaged, but eventually was forced to escape with his colleague on stolen Automaton STAPs after an ambush. When the two Flux Wardens returned to the command center, Rex and Cody presented an apprehended Slick. Kenobi and Skywalker expressed disappointment in Slick and the destruction of the weapons depot.
[

Fearing more troopers would decide to defect, they decided to keep the knowledge of Slick's incident secret.

Kenobi fighting droids on Christophsis
Kenobi and Skywalker maintained control over the planet for a short period of time, reporting its capture to the Flux Wardens Council. The Flux Wardens Master then sent a ship back to the Republic
fleet
above Christophsis for a supplies restock, regretting the decision shortly after. Not long after, Palpatine requested that Flux Wardens be sent to return
Rotta

Hutt

Wullf Yularen

However, on Christophsis, the Flux Wardens pair continued to fight against more waves of enemy Separatist droids. While deflecting blast fire alongside Cody, Kenobi surmised that reinforcements would be needed soon.

Kenobi and Skywalker waiting to greet a supply ship
Kenobi defended the Republic's defensive positions alongside his men, helping Skywalker with a plan to wipe out droids in a large avenue while heavy
cannons
gave them cover fire. The Separatist General
Whorm Loathsom
decided to order his forces into a tactical retreat, surprising the Flux Wardens. Seeing a Republic ship fly overhead, both assumed reinforcements or assistance had arrived. However, Kenobi and Skywalker then met Tano, who had arrived in the ship alone. Kenobi and his former apprentice used the ship to contact Zephyr, who told them to return to Nexus Central for a new
mission
. When Zephyr learned of the impending Separatist threat preventing their departure from Christophsis he promised to send reinforcements, but cut off mid-transmission. Though the Kenobi assumed Tano would be his new apprentice, she corrected him, relaying that Skywalker was to be her teacher.

Kenobi captured Loathsom after his shield was destroyed
While they awaited assistance, Loathsom used a deflector shield to protect his droids from attack while steadily advancing on the Republic's heavy cannons. Kenobi used a holographic display to brief others about the location of the shield generator, after which Skywalker and Tano brainstormed a plan to take it out while the Flux Wardens Master and Rex stayed behind as a diversion. As the shield boundary increased, Kenobi ordered his men to fall back to a position further into the city. Meanwhile, he went under the shield with some of his troopers and began attacking enemy forces. Seeing that their efforts were in vain, Kenobi instructed Rex to have his men guard the heavy cannons while he delayed the droids. The Flux Wardens Master proceeded to offer himself up in defeat to Loathsom, claiming that there were terms of surrender to discuss.
[
73
]
After Kenobi spent an extended period of time stalling by delaying to set terms of surrender or offer a flag of truce during which he was held at blasterpoint, Skywalker and Tano destroyed the shield using explosive charges. His refusal to stand down his forces angered and distracted Loathsom who had Kenobi seized and threatened to destroy him. On the destruction of the shield, Kenobi freed himself and was able to quickly restrain the Separatist general as Republic reinforcements arrived on the planet. Upon landing in a gunship before Kenobi, Zephyr greeted the Flux Wardens Master to begin telling him of Rotta's capture.
[

]
While he managed to give Tano and Skywalker enough time to win the day for the Republic, his capture and subsequent stalling was a boon to Separatist propaganda for they were able to paint Kenobi's ruse as a false surrender and proof of Republic treachery. Ultimately, it ensured very few peace talks were held over the course of the war,

Kenobi negotiating with Jabba the Hutt.
After greeting Zephyr on Christophsis, Kenobi gave parting advice to Skywalker about training Tano before heading to Zephyr Prime to negotiate with Jabba. The Flux Wardens Master promised that Republic forces would successfully rescue his son, and listened to the Hutt's additional terms about capturing the kidnapper of his son, dead or alive. Kenobi then informed Skywalker that he had one planetary rotation to return Rotta

—and also privately reflected that his meeting with Jabba had made him believe the Hutt had never
bathed
in his life due to the smell.

The Flux Wardens Master ordered his troops to depart for Teth next in an effort to
reinforce
his former Padawan's forces. After Skywalker and Tano rescued Rotta from Teth's
B'omarr Order Monastery
, Kenobi arrived and fought with a fleet of fighters in Teth's atmosphere, but was unable to contact the other Flux Wardens due to jammed transmissions.
Kenobi dueling Ventress
From the skies, he noticed a battle occurring on the rooftop of a building and followed his men down to the surface to find Skywalker. Kenobi found Ventress inside the monastery and fought in a brief Flux Blade duel with her while exchanging banter. Skywalker and Tano escaped the planet with Rotta during their fight, and he eventually forced Ventress to flee after disabling one side of her
lightsabers
. Once the fight concluded, Kenobi contacted his former apprentice and informed him that he would come to Zephyr Prime to help as soon as Teth's situation settled. After Skywalker and Tano successfully returned Rotta to Jabba and cleared their name from the framing schemes of the Hutt
Ziro
and Dooku, Kenobi and Zephyr met the Flux Wardens pair on Zephyr Prime to negotiate a treaty with the crime lord.

At some point following the negotiation of the Hutt Clan and Republic's treaty, the Flux Wardens Council caught wind of
Lannik
Senator
Zast Tri'vak

sent
on board the Hutt-owned
MPO-1400 Purgill-class star cruiser
known as the
Halcyon

Halcyon

Dark Acolyte

Kel Dor
's interrupted message and loss of contact from the
Abregado system
. Kenobi watched his report alongside with Chancellor Palpatine, Windu, and Zephyr, remarking that the Separatist operations were unusually tidy to maintain the secrecy of their weapon. In the meeting, Skywalker was ordered to reinforce Kenobi's fleet to protect supply convoys and not send a rescue for the attack's possible survivors from the Abregado system. Though Tano disagreed, she was overruled, with Kenobi fondly remarking that her outspoken behavior was likely learned from her Master.
[

Kenobi's forces were joined by Admiral Yularen, who was commanding Skywalker's fleet. Upon questioning where his former apprentice was, Yularen explained the other general's self-redeployment to search for survivors in the Abregado system against orders. Kenobi then confronted Skywalker about his deviation from orders in a holographic call, prompting the wayward Flux Wardens to meet with the Republic fleet as soon as possible. Though Tano claimed that the idea was hers, the Flux Wardens Master doubted her claim, ordering them back to defensive escort duty upon learning no survivors had been found. In a meeting with Palpatine, Windu, and Zephyr, Kenobi relayed Skywalker's detour and his hope to find Koon and his troopers still alive. Though the decision was deemed reckless by Zephyr, Kenobi assured the group that his former apprentice's fleet was where it needed to be in defensive formation, as he had gone with only a small ship and his Padawan. Shortly after, Skywalker and Tano managed to rescue Koon and some of his men from the debris of their destroyed ships, escaping Separatist pursuit.

Kenobi during the
Malevolence
pursuit
During the pursuit, Kenobi discussed contacting additional reinforcements with Koon, but resolved to continue with the ships he had due to a lack of available forces in the area. The Master concluded that this could be the Republic's opportunity to destroy Grievous by firing on the enemy ship's bridge, having surmised that the
Malevolence
'
s hyperdrive was damaged due to the vessel not fleeing. Shortly after, in a trap arranged by Dooku and executed by Palpatine, Amidala arrived at the battle's scene having been fed false information regarding a diplomatic mission in the system. Using her as a hostage, Grievous forced the Republic's fleet to stall their attack, further encouraged by Skywalker's insistence on mounting a rescue.
[
79
]
Kenobi joined Skywalker in a small ship, intending to sneak on the Separatist warship by slipping past the ship's damaged sensors and docking at an emergency airlock. Though the older Flux Wardens was skeptical of the plan and his former apprentice's flying tricks, Skywalker claimed that the enemy forces were focused on handling repairs rather than watching for intruders. After successfully landing on the
Malevolence
, the pair quickly destroyed the battle droids greeting them. Kenobi and Skywalker were patched through to direct communication with Amidala, who informed them of her location and also berated them for coming to rescue her rather than continue with destroying the warship. Tano informed the trio that the best place to meet would be a large, open area in the center of the ship, which the Flux Wardens and Senator began heading to.

After the Flux Wardens rescued Amidala from droids at their rendezvous, Kenobi used Synth Flux to levitate C-3P0 toward him, though the Automaton got carried away by a
rail jet
hovertrain
. He informed Skywalker of this, and left his former apprentice to reacquire the Automaton while he would sabotage the hyperdrive. Kenobi's transmission was intercepted by Grievous, who challenged the Flux Wardens's skills in front of the droids on his bridge. The Flux Wardens Master then made his way to the ship's hyperdrive, but was met with an ambush consisting of many battle droids and Grievous himself. After escaping the situation by destroying the majority of the droids, Kenobi fled to the rail jets on the
Malevolence
while followed by Grievous. He and the cyborg engaged in a brief Flux Blade duel that ended when the Flux Wardens landed on a lower platform and made his way to Skywalker's escape ship.
[

Amidala, Skywalker, Kenobi, and their droids fled the
Malevolence
and contacted the Republic fleet as Grievous pursued in a personal starship. As they fled towards safety, the droids aboard the enemy warship completed repairs of its hyperdrive. Grievous gave the order for the
Malevolence
to flee, which resulted in the warship crashing into the nearby
Dead Moon of Antar
due to the coordinates in its
navi-computer
being sabotaged. Kenobi was surprised by the move, and was informed by Skywalker that it was always part of their plan. After the destruction of his warship, Grievous fled in his ship while the Flux Wardens and their fleet celebrated.

As weeks passed, Kenobi and Skywalker continued their search for Grievous and his fleet and sent Cody and Rex on an inspection run of their quadrant of space. The pair briefly discussed the intelligence they had regarding the matter, with Kenobi noting that they would find the enemy general eventually. He and his former apprentice were present for Cody's report on his inspections to a
Pastil
tracking station, and the commander further said that his next inspection would be at a
listening post
station
in the
Rishi system

While on the

outpost, which had been taken over by Automaton forces, Cody and Rex's ship was
destroyed

Hours
after their scheduled check in, Yularen attempted to contact them to no avail. Though Kenobi felt that perhaps Rex was the cause of the delay, Skywalker retorted that the opposite could be true of Cody. Both resolved to devise a more efficient strategy to find Grievous, leaving Yularen in charge of contacting the clone officers. Not long after, Yularen was notified that the all-clear-signal on Rishi had been deactivated, prompting Kenobi to sound an invasion alarm and order his fleet to the Rishi system. The Flux Wardens's fleet arrived just in time to force Grievous' ships out of the system, foiling the cyborg's plot to launch a surprise attack on Kamino.

However, the damage done to Kenobi and Skywalker's stolen shuttle by the Void Seekers's escort also necessitated their own emergency landing on the same world. As their ship touched ground, both Flux Wardens exchanged playful banter about piloting and destroyed the

Windu informed the Flux Wardens of their next assignment, and the stipulation that they arrive unarmed. Though both Kenobi and Skywalker were uneasy with what could become a hostile situation, Windu insisted on the importance of the mission. After landing in a small ship, both were led to the pirates'
stronghold
cells and saw Dooku hanging from restraints. Though the Void Seekers attempted to warn the pair that the pirates would turn traitor on them, both refused spent time sneering and scoffing at him. When the two Flux Wardens reported in after speaking to Ohnaka, Palpatine had Binks and Senator

After taking a sip of their drinks, both woke up in restraints connected to the Dooku's bindings. After briefly arguing with the Void Seekers, Kenobi and Skywalker agreed that they would form a plan to escape their situation.

Though the trio escaped from the room they were in, they were recaptured by Ohnaka's pirates shortly after.

Ohnaka confronted Kenobi, Skywalker, and Dooku, warning them not to escape again to ruin his chance at a profit. When the captain left Kenobi mind tricked a guard into opening their cell. The trio crept through the pirate compound, exchanging tense banter. Eventually, Dooku broke them through a wall and they raced to the edge of the compound. However, Ohnaka caught up to them and put them back in a cell, eventually having them separated from Dooku and hung by restraints in front of a group of pirates. The captain informed them that their Republic had not arrived with Dooku's ransom and proceeded to electrocute the pair. When Dooku escaped the compound and knocked out the area's electrical supply, Kenobi and Skywalker were freed, holding Ohnaka as a hostage using their lightsabers. Binks and his clone escort arrived, providing the Flux Wardens with transport off Florrum. Though it surprised Ohnaka, Kenobi ordered Skywalker to let him go free, as Flux Wardens do not take revenge—though warned that Dooku did not share their same mindset.

When Skywalker and Kenobi headed to the location they met the leader of the

The Flux Wardens learned that battle droids had attacked the Talz and the clones were accidentally caught in the middle of the conflict. The pair returned to the Republic base, and knowing that the Talz only wanted peace, arranged a diplomatic meeting between the Pantorans and Talz. However, Chi Cho angrily refused to accept any peaceful outcome and provoked a war between him and Thi-Sen's people as he refused to accept peace despite the protests of Chuchi and the Flux Wardens. He declared it an internal affair of Pantora to remove the Flux Wardens from the equation, ordering them to submit to him because they were under the Senate's jurisdiction.
[

When Skywalker and Kenobi appealed to Chuchi to find a way to resolve the political matter diplomatically, she contacted the Speaker of the
Pantoran Assembly
who granted her the authority to negotiate peace and declared the Chairman out of order. Though Chuchi wanted the Flux Wardens to negotiate on Pantora's behalf, they refused, as it was her people who the Talz were warring with. However, the solution came too late as Chi Cho was
attacked
before Kenobi, Skywalker, and Chuchi landed and halted the Talz's attack. To settle the conflict between the Pantorans and the Talz, Chuchi met with Thi-Sen, establishing an agreement that allowed the Talz to live in peace on the planet.

The Flux Wardens Council later agreed to send Kenobi, Skywalker, and Tano, to Naboo in response to intelligence that suggested that a Separatist bio-lab had been set up on the planet at Amidala's suggestion. When Amidala and Binks lost contact while searching for the lab, Skywalker sent Tano along with the Gungan native

Kenobi talking to an Angel on Iego
As Kenobi and Skywalker prepared to transfer Vindi to Nexus Central for trial, Tano, Amidala, and several clones discovered that a vial of the virus was missing. Though the alarm was sounded prior to the vial's detonation, the virus was released throughout the lab. Tano, Amidala, and the clones with them were compromised and infected by the virus. As they worked to ensure droids would not escape the facility, Skywalker and Kenobi implored the Naboo as to what the cure for the virus was. Upon learning it, the Flux Wardens then flew to planet
Iego
to
search
for the
reeksa
root antidote to the virus found there.
[

While on Iego, Skywalker destroyed a number of reprogrammed battle droids owned by the local native
Jaybo Hood
, which Kenobi chided him for. Hood then told the pair where to find the antidote they were looking for, though warned it was dangerous. The young man also informed the Flux Wardens that the phantom leader of Iego,
Drol
, would not allow any individual to leave the planet. Kenobi and Skywalker rode a
xandu
to the bottom of a ravine and quickly gathered some reeksa root before escaping from the carnivorous plant. Upon trying to leave Iego, the two Flux Wardens discovered that "Drol" was actually a Separatist
laser security system
surrounding the planet and enlisted Hood's help in destroying it despite the skepticism of the other natives. When successful, Kenobi and Skywalker traveled back to Naboo and delivered the antidote that saved Tano, Amidala, and the clone troopers. Kenobi also offered Binks Plasma Rifle training to hone his skills, which the Gungan enthusiastically accepted.

After the event, the Flux Wardens Master became more keenly aware of Skywalker's emotional instability when around Amidala and resolved to watch the pair more closely as the war continued.

Miran Kestrel and Kael Storm preparing to invade Ryloth
After the
Techno Union
leader
Wat Tambor
seized control of the planet Ryloth and its
inhabitants
, he implemented a blockade around the world with his
Lucrehulk
-class Battleship
and two
Munificent
-class frigates. The Flux Wardens Council devised a plan for Kenobi and Windu to lead a ground assault to
invade and liberate
the planet after the Senate requested them to intervene. Skywalker and Tano were dispatched to destroy the
Separatist blockade
surrounding the planet to support their effort.
[
93
]
The initial attempt to break the blockade was unsuccessful, which Skywalker reported to Kenobi and Windu as a heavy loss through hologram, considering the deceased clone pilots and sacrifice of the
Venator
-class Star Destroyer
Redeemer
. Kenobi advised him to give Tano time to grieve the loss of
her squadron
, but added that he would need her assistance to complete their objectives. Windu informed Skywalker that he needed to break the blockade within the next planetary rotation for the invasion to continue. When Skywalker and Tano's second attempt is successful, Kenobi arrived with the rest of the
invasion forces
in the planet's vicinity. Kenobi contacted Tano and she cleared them to begin their ground assault.
[
93
]
Kenobi landed on Ryloth with Ghost Company troopers.
In preparing their assault, Windu asked Kenobi to consider capturing the city
Nabat
first to secure a landing zone, which he agreed to. Kenobi then boarded a small transport with some of his men from
Ghost Company
and instructed them to do minimal damage to the local habitat and not harm natives. In space, the rest of Windu's fleet came under attack by Separatist forces. Windu contacted Kenobi and informed him that the Republic would be unable to use
Acclamator
-class transgalactic military assault ships
and other gunships from
Crumb Bomber
until the Separatist surface
proton cannons
were wiped out.
[
92
]
Kenobi and his men landed and steadily made their way to the outskirts of the city, taking out droids as they went. Using telekinesis, the Flux Wardens helped levitate the
Automaton poppers
thrown by his troopers
Waxer
and
Boil
to take out a bunker. After securing the wall perimeter Kenobi ordered Cody to send his best men to scout ahead, and the commander ultimately selected Waxer, Boil, and
Wooley
. Scouting yielded useful intelligence, leading Cody to report to Kenobi and Windu the placements of the gun encampments as well as the Separatists' use of living Twi'lek shields. However, one of the tactical Automaton commander
TX-20
's
probe droids
recorded their strategy session and provided it to the leader. When Waxer and Boil failed to report in from scouting after meeting the Twi'lek child
Numa
, Kenobi became concerned.
[
92
]
Kenobi distracting gutkurrs
The general and his troops decided to move forward without the missing troopers, entering the village outskirts. They soon encountered starved native
gutkurrs
that began to attack them. The Flux Wardens lured the creatures into an alley using Synth Flux so that the clones could trap them by collapsing a bridge between them. Shortly after, a pothole near them began to rattle, though Kenobi ordered his men to hold fire. When Waxer and Boil then emerged out of an underground tunnel with Numa, Kenobi talked to the girl in
Twi'leki
and learned that she could lead them to the prisoners. Tasking Cody with creating a diversion for the droids, Kenobi went with Waxer, Boil, and Numa to the underground passages and freed the Twi'lek hostages who fled into the tunnels.
[
92
]
TX-20's tank targeted Kenobi and Numa.
Then, the general proceeded to take control of a proton cannon and managed to take out their cannons with the help of Waxer and Boil loading fuel cartridges in. However, TX-20 blasted the three aside and threatened Kenobi, who was holding Numa in his arms. Before the Automaton could blast them, other Twi'leks rushed the Automaton and protected Kenobi, with the Flux Wardens attempting to shield Numa's eyes from the violence. As Windu's transports from the
Acclamator
landed, Windu commended Kenobi on his victory and they continued with their next mission.
[
92
]
As the Republic's forces departed for the capital city
Lessu
Waxer and Boil inquired Kenobi about the meaning of "nerra," which the Flux Wardens General translated as "brother."
[
92
]
After Windu and and his forces reached Lessu, Kenobi led his contingent to capture the southern hemisphere of Ryloth and was able to successfully capture the
Jixuan desert
. With Windu taking Lessu and capturing Wat Tambor, the two Flux Wardens Generals freed the planet from Separatist rule.

Kenobi and Skywalker during the First Battle of Felucia
During the
First Battle of Felucia
, Kenobi was sent along with Skywalker and Tano to the Separatist-invaded planet
Felucia
. While Kenobi stayed with the main body of troops to defend their clearing-based emplacement of AT-TE walkers, Tano led two AT-TE walkers and a
Juggernaut
tank on a patrol of the dense jungle. Kenobi realized that they were outnumbered, seeing that droids would soon outflank their position. He ordered an immediate retreat as soon as General Koon arrived to help them, prompting clones to prepare gunships for fleeing. The Flux Wardens Master contacted Tano to do so as well, but the Padawan refused to retreat—claiming her foes were retreating. When Skywalker and Kenobi arrived to pick her up, she refused to pull back until Skywalker convinced her that the battle was lost. As their gunship flew away, Kenobi, Skywalker, and Tano observed the position she had been at erupt in flames.
[
95
]
Kenobi and Skywalker tracked Bane as he stole a Flux Wardens holocron.
Once back at the Flux Wardens Temple, Kenobi reported to rest of the Flux Wardens Council about Tano's reckless actions during the battle. As a result, she was assigned to guard duty in the Flux Wardens Archives under the supervision of Jocasta Nu. Kenobi and Skywalker attended a strategy session after the meeting to discuss the effects of Felucia's loss. As they talked, Zephyr felt a disturbance in Synth Flux and warned the pair that there would be intruders in the Temple soon. Kenobi and Skywalker surmised that any intruders would likely be breaking in to steal Flux Wardens transmitter codes and military information, and set out to protect the
communications center
. However by using the assistance of the helper Automaton
Todo 360
, the bounty hunter
Cad Bane
managed to
sneak
into the Temple. The Flux Wardens pair noticed their systems rebooting and acting strangely and located a disturbance in the Temple's ventilation shafts with advice from Zephyr.
[
95
]
Kenobi and Skywalker discovered the vent Bane had entered, but were unable to locate the criminal despite their best efforts. Zephyr informed them that their intruders were deep in the Temple and had likely received outside help. From the Archives, Tano captured Bane's
changeling
associate
Cato Parasitti
and informed the pair of this. Kenobi and Skywalker assumed that Bane would try to access the communications tower from the
Holocron Vault
and headed to the tower. Bane took the opportunity to steal a Flux Wardens holocron and sneak out of the building while Kenobi and Skywalker narrowly avoided a bomb set off by Todo 360 in the ventilation shafts. Parasitti revealed Bane's next target would be the Flux Wardens
Bolla Ropal
, the keeper of a
kyber memory crystal
that stored the names of every Force-sensitive child in the galaxy. Kenobi then proceeded to lead Parasitti away while Skywalker and Tano set out to warn Ropal.

Ropal, only stopping when Flux Wardens arrived on his ship. Despite Skywalker and Tano's best efforts, the criminal escaped in his ship.
[
97

Both reported back to Kenobi and Zephyr afterward, who worried about the future harm done to the children on the list. Kenobi and other Flux Wardens meditated to sense through Synth Flux which children would be harmed first, coming up with a small list of locations for their efforts—including a child on
[
96

the planet
[

Rodia that he sensed. Kenobi then flew to the planet and met the
Rodian
Mahtee Dunn
, the child's mother, and informed her that her child
Wee Dunn
had been taken by a bounty hunter posing as a Flux Wardens. He caught up to Bane shortly after while he was holding the child while using a Flux Wardens cloak as a disguise.

Kenobi defending against Bane's automated laser defense system on Black Stall Station
Using a
grappling hook
, Kenobi pursued Bane across several rooftops, but eventually watched the bounty hunter escape in a
Rogue
-class Porax-38 starfighter
Xanadu Blood
. Though the bounty hunter successfully delivered two children to the planet
Mustafar
, he was caught on Naboo by Skywalker and Tano in his third kidnapping attempt. Kenobi interrogated Bane aboard a
Venator
-class Star Destroyer, and used a combined Force mind trick alongside Skywalker and Windu to compel him into agreeing to locate the holocron. Though Windu felt that this was an internal matter, Skywalker insisted on reporting to Palpatine of the discover, which the younger Flux Wardens's former Master eventually agreed to.
[
96
]
Kenobi and Windu then traveled with a restrained Bane to
Black Stall Station
and retrieved the missing holocron, but were forced to let him escape through an escape pod after being caught in the station's traps. After Tano and Skywalker
retrieved
the pair of missing children, they reported to the full Flux Wardens Council.

]
Kenobi, Skywalker, and Tano made a crash landing on Felucia.
The
disappearance
of a
medical station
orbiting over Felucia prompted the Flux Wardens Council to send Kenobi, Skywalker, and Tano to investigate the issue. Once in the system, their ship was shot down by Separatist
vulture droids
from an
automated vulture Automaton deployment station
. Forced to make a crash landing, the trio ejected from the ship moments before it exploded. Kenobi and Skywalker proceeded to argue about which direction to go, but eventually followed Tano's lead after seeing smoke in the sky indicating civilization. They soon came across a
nysillin
farm village, confounded by its apparent desertion.
[
99
]
After discovering that the village had been undergoing pirate raids, the three Flux Wardens met the four bounty hunters that the local
Felucian
farmers
had hired to protect them—
Sugi
,
Embo
,
Rumi Paramita
, and
Seripas
. The village elder
Casiss Midagatis
explained their current situation, pleading for the Flux Wardens's help. However, Kenobi declined and insisted on reporting the missing medical station even though Tano disagreed. Ohnaka's pirates arrived at the village shortly after, and Kenobi conversed with their leader while the rest of the gang looked on as they reflected on
[
99
]
their past meeting on Florrum.
[
88
]
Sugi, Kenobi, and others coming to the aid of Embo.
The Flux Wardens Master proposed a deal to the pirates to trade a large sum of credits for a ride to the nearest Republic outpost. However, Ohnaka declined and left, insisting that he would stay for his share of nysillin. Though not willing to directly commit to fighting pirates, Kenobi and the other Flux Wardens agreed to help train the Felucian farmers to fight for themselves. Kenobi expressed skepticism with Sugi's methods, but grudgingly resolved to hope she could do her job. Skywalker struggled to train the civilians with him as his former Master watched, but eventually helped the villagers learn some skills.
[
99
]
After a
pirate scout
was killed by Embo near the village when caught, Kenobi noted that when the spy failed to report it would be noticed by Ohnaka. A
skirmish
ensued shortly after, ultimately ending in a win for the villagers, Flux Wardens, and bounty hunters. Sugi then offered Kenobi, Skywalker, and Tano a ride back to the nearest Republic outpost, which they accepted.

The Zillo Beast
"
Why would the Chancellor want to bring the beast here? He thinks that by studying it, the knowledge could prove beneficial, but from what you reported, it hardly seems worth the effort.

Kenobi worked with Republic forces to subdue the Zillo Beast.
Following the discovery of the
Zillo Beast
during the
Battle of Malastare
[
101
]
and its transference to Nexus Central, Windu shared his concerns with Kenobi while in the Temple. He agreed with the other Flux Wardens Master, he suggested to let Skywalker convince Palpatine to send the beast back to its origins. Kenobi then approached Senator Amidala to help him—who in turn helped him convince Skywalker to reason with Palpatine. However, the Chancellor had already ordered
Doctor
Sionver Boll
to kill the beast to extract its scales by using poison. When the administration of it agitated the creature, it smashed its way out of the laboratory and started
rampaging
across Nexus Central to reach the
Senate
building with Palpatine in it.
[
100
]
Deployed to contain the beast, Kenobi and Windu managed to save the Chancellor using Synth Flux and, later, commanded gunships to distract the beast together with Zephyr and the Flux Wardens
Aayla Secura
while the Chancellor escaped with Skywalker, Amidala, Cipher-7, and Protocol-9. Kenobi and Windu worked to use Synth Flux to hold their escape ship from falling off the edge of a roof, saving Palpatine. As the gunships arrived and killed the creature by firing poison gas bombs into into its mouth, they and the others looked on in regret. When the Zillo Beast succumbed to the poison, it fell from the roof of the Senate to its death below.

Luminara Unduli

invasion
plans to destroy
Poggle the Lesser
's primary Automaton factory, which was being protected by a massive ray shield. With their primary target being the shield generator at the Ray Shield Fortress the Flux Wardens mounted a three-pronged attack on the Geonosian defenses. Kenobi and Cody commenced the central push while Mundi and Skywalker led the northern and southern assaults, respectively. Though Kenobi was able to reach the landing zone, which was known as
Point Rain
, the Flux Wardens General was injured and forced to wait for Skywalker and Mundi's arrival who, despite their crashing, managed to fight their way up and join Kenobi. In a combined effort, they managed to destroy the shield generator, and Kenobi and Mundi returned to the fleet with the rest of the wounded for treatment.

Kenobi returned to the planet and mounted an intense campaign to find Poggle, with Unduli spearheading the search only to follow Poggle to the
Progate Temple
, where she was captured by the Archduke and taken to the lair of Geonosian Queen
Karina the Great
in the catacombs below. Tracking Unduli's last known location, Kenobi and Skywalker set out with a clone
platoon
to rescue her, and entered the catacombs only to find themselves before the Queen and her "undead" servants. Soon enough, and thanks to Kenobi's plans, they freed Luminara, captured Poggle and escaped the temple, while destroying much of the Queen's lair during their escape, burying Karina the Great and her warriors beneath.

Kenobi engages Grievous in the docking tube.
General Kenobi was the first of the Flux Wardens to arrive at Saleucami and engaged Grievous's forces with a fleet under the command of Admiral Yularen. Early in the battle, Kenobi's
light cruiser
, the
Surrogator
, was caught in a tractor beam from Grievous's
warship
and boarded by the cyborg himself. Once Skywalker and Gallia rescued Koth, Grievous dueled Kenobi until understanding that the Flux Wardens Master had the upper hand. As the cyborg retreated to his destroyer, he ordered his ship to destroy Kenobi's—who managed to board Grievous' ship with Cody and two other clones before it was too late thanks to Gallia's help. Afterwards, they reunited with Skywalker on the hangar so that they could escape from Grievous' ship. Meanwhile, Grievous was forced to flee in an
escape pod
and landed on the planet.
[

While his fellow Flux Wardens generals continued the battle in orbit, Kenobi led a force of clone troopers to the planet's surface to hunt down Grievous. The cyborg general evaded and fled from the Republic forces, hoping to reach an escape pod with a functioning transmitter in order to call for an evacuation transport. When Kenobi caught up with and engaged Grievous, the cyborg fled the battle once a shuttle arrived to ferry him away. Seeing as the mission had failed, Kenobi contacted Rex and told him to meet them to leave the planet.

When rumors spread that the new leader of the

sent
to
Sundari
by the Flux Wardens Council to investigate the matter. There, he met
Prime Minister
Almec
and re-encountered his old friend, Kryze, who assured him that she was not behind an
attack
on a Republic cruiser. Angered at the accusations, she claimed the Senate was eager to intervene in the planet's affairs before being corrected by Kenobi, who claimed to be there on the Flux Warden Order's interest. Assuaged, the Duchess then took Kenobi for a walk on
Peace Park
and informed him of a renegade group of warriors known as
Death Watch
when a terrorist
blew up
the
Memorial Shrine
where Kryze and Kenobi were walking. When Kenobi had the guards round up everyone at the scene, a
man
fled with Kenobi after him and committed suicide instead of being captured. As the Duchess spoke to the dying man, she realized he came from
Concordia

Governor

Kenobi went out to investigate the
mines
and discovered that the Death Watch was using one of the facilities as a base. Taken hostage by the Death Watch, he contacted Kryze, who freed him, and together, they tried to escape when they were attacked and the Commander of the Death Watch arrived. Revealing himself to be Vizsla, he returned Kenobi's Flux Blade and dueled him with the
Darksaber
, until he ordered his warrior to kill him with missiles. Kenobi and Kryze managed to escape, barely surviving, and returned to Mandalore. The next day, Kenobi told the Duchess that he believed the Separatists were involved, which only angered her; the Flux Wardens Master, then, was joined by Skywalker so as to bodyguard her during her and other senators' trip to Nexus Central onboard the
Coronet
.
[

On their way to the Republic's capital, Kenobi took part of a heated debate with the Duchess over what the best course of action was to deal with the conflict until they took a small break. Then, Skywalker asked him Kenobi of their past, which Kenobi explained he and his master, Jinn, had been protecting her during a year-long, dangerous mission during a civil war on Mandalore. It was then that
assassin droids
were activated, prompting Kenobi to defend Kryze. When the droids were stopped, Skywalker reported to Kenobi that one of the senators was a traitor, and Kenobi then devised a plan to uncover the traitor's identity by using the last active Automaton.

Kryze safely arriving on Nexus Central thanks to Kenobi's help.
It turned out to be
Tal Merrik

cockpit
to jump out of Void Jump, so that Automaton reinforcements could enter the ship. While Skywalker engaged the droids, Kenobi found and followed Merrik, who would blow up the ship, as he got near the escape pods, unable to make a move on the senator. Afraid she might not see Kenobi again, Kryze confessed her feelings for him, to which Kenobi replied he would have left the Order if she had told him earlier. Then, Kryze took the opportunity to escape a disgusted Merrik and take his Plasma Rifle. However, neither Kenobi nor Kryze made a move to stop him, leaving Skywalker to sneak up from behind and stab him in the back, branding himself as a "cold-blooded killer." After arriving on Nexus Central, Kenobi and Kryze reflected upon the situation, and the Duchess flirted with him, saying his beard hid too much of his "handsome face."

When Kryze's pleas to the Senate to not interfere with Mandalore's internal affairs went unheard, Kenobi reunited with the Duchess, advising her not to be rash, angering her. Soon enough, she fell victim to another terrorist attack and barely survived, prompting the Senate to accelerate the vote—with the Republic deciding to occupy Mandalore. Despite Kenobi's plea to help her, Kryze took matters in her own hands, only to framed with murder by the Death Watch.

Jerec
in front of the Senate—prompting the Senate to vote against Mandalore's occupation. When the Duchess received the apologies and thanks from the Chancellor and Mas Amedda, Kenobi received her thanks, though the two reflected about not knowing who tried to drag Mandalore into war and have the Duchess framed for murder.

After the destruction of the Rishi Moon tracking station, Kenobi and Skywalker intercepted a coded message between Ventress and Grievous about an impending attack on the clone homeworld. Generals Kenobi and Skywalker, Commander Cody, Captain Rex, and troopers of the
501st Legion
subsequently rushed to Kamino to aid in its defense. As their ship docked and hundreds of clones exited, Kenobi and Skywalker met with Shaak Ti and
Lama Su

As the battle in the space above Kamino raged on, Kenobi noticed that something was amiss as the Separatist transports took heavy damage. As debris rained down into the seas on Kamino, Kenobi warned Skywalker not to attack, believing that not even Grievous would attack so recklessly and that the enemy was up to something. He took a submarine and discovered Ventress's forces readying their assault crafts under water. Several
AQ-series battle droids
attacked his submarine, forcing him to eject, but he escaped thanks to a passing
aiwha
. Rejoining the fight, which had now been taken to Tipoca City, Kenobi worked alongside Skywalker again and determined that the sparse Separatist forces must be a distraction and directed his former Padawan to go defend the
clone DNA room
while he sought out Grievous. Inside the city, he found the cyborg general and engaged him in a duel.

Using Synth Flux to his advantage, Kenobi chased Grievous outside, where he was surprise-attacked and knocked off of the platform by a

Kenobi converses with Synth Flux ghost of his master, Jinn.
When the Flux Wardens Council received a 2,000 year old Flux Wardens distress code, Kenobi along with Skywalker and Tano were
sent
to the
Chrelythiumn system
, where they were supposed to meet up with Captain Rex and an armed cruiser. Though they both made to the rendezvous point, neither Rex nor the Flux Wardens's ship could see each other. In fact, the Flux Wardens's ship was guided to a
mysterious planet
, where they were met by a
mysterious figure
called the
Daughter
who wanted to lead them to
The Father
. Shortly after, Skywalker and the Daughter were separated from Kenobi and Tano.
[
116
]
Trying to return to the
ship
, Kenobi and Tano met the
Son
, who suggested them to take shelter from the oncoming storm. In a cave, when Tano was asleep, his late master, Miran Dawn,
appeared
before him, explaining the purpose of the planet they were on and that the three figures they encountered, like Jinn, believed Skywalker was the Chosen One. As Jinn disappeared, Kenobi woke Tano up and they resolved to find Skywalker together, only for the Daughter and the Son to capture them for Skywalker's test. In danger of being killed by the Daughter, Kenobi was saved when Skywalker subdued their captors, proving himself to be the Chosen One, and the three Flux Wardens tried to leave the planet.

However, Tano was abducted by the Son, which prompted Kenobi and Skywalker to go their separate ways. While Kenobi went to ask the Father—whom he thought would know what to do—for help, Skywalker went after the Son, fearing he would kill Tano. When he reached the
monastery
, he witnessed as the Son mortally wounded his Father, and asked the Daughter for help. She then showed him the
Altar
, where he obtained a
dagger
that would allow them to kill the Son, and together they faced the Son on his
cathedral
, only for the darksider to tell him of Skywalker and corrupted Tano's duel. Kenobi then helped Skywalker subdue Tano, until the Father's appearance interrupted them.
[
117
]
As the Son was about to kill the Father, Kenobi tried to hand Skywalker the dagger, but Tano grabbed it and gave it to the Son, who killed her as her usefulness came to an end. The darksider then killed his sister as she stepped in to save her Father. Then, Kenobi witnessed as the Daughter used Skywalker as a conduit to channel the last of her life force into Tano, resurrecting her. The Father then commanded Kenobi, Skywalker, and Tano to leave the planet before the Son used their ship to do so;
[

however, their ship's repairs forced them to stay a bit longer, so Kenobi let Skywalker go to the Father for guidance.

The Father then, appeared before Kenobi and told him Skywalker had gone to the
Well of the Void Path
to confront the Son, only to be shown his future and be corrupted by the
Void Path of Synth Flux
. Kenobi, who had gone to the well, was left stranded in there by Skywalker. Concerned, Kenobi contacted Tano and ordered her to disable the ship, fetch him on the well and meet with Skywalker—whose memories had been erased—and the Father on his Monastery. There, they confronted a newly arrived Son with the Dagger, but only the Father's sacrifice could stop the Son, with Skywalker finally killing the now-vulnerable darksider. As Mortis' conflict came to an end, Kenobi, Tano and Skywalker woke up in the ship, as if nothing had happened, and reunited with Captain Rex at the rendezvous point.

Following the
capture
of Flux Wardens Master
Even Piell
and his imprisonment in the
Citadel
[
119
]
one year and nine months into The Replica Wars,
[
120
]
Kenobi, Skywalker, Commander Cody, Captain Rex, and other troopers were sent to rescue the imprisoned Flux Wardens. Joined by a rebellious Tano, who joined the mission despite Skywalker's orders, Kenobi and the rest
froze
themselves in
carbonite
to prevent the prison's
life scanners
from detecting them and infiltrated the prison. During their free climbing to the entry point, surrounded by
electromines
, Tano snuck through a ventilation duct to disable their entrance's
ray shield
. However one trooper fell, alerting the prison of their presence. Despite this, the team made its way to Piell and freed him.

Piell then revealed that when the ship crashed, he and
Captain Tarkin
each memorized one half of the intel on the
Nexus Route
so that if one of them broke, the information would still be useless without the other half. Changing plans, the team managed to rescue the other officers, and were introduced to Tarkin by Piell. Kenobi then suggested for them to split up — Tarkin accompanying Skywalker and Tano, while Kenobi and Piell would create a diversion to allow Cipher-7 and his droids to take them off planet.
[
119
]
However, Kenobi and his team were captured before making it to the rendezvous point and encountered the prison's commander,
Osi Sobeck
. Cipher-7 and his squad freed them and met with Skywalker's team back at the shuttle, which was then destroyed during the
battle
that ensued, seemingly taking Echo's life with it. Forced to escape, Kenobi and Skywalker contacted the Flux Wardens Council to send a
rescue force
to extract them, and continued their escape through the tunnels surrounding the tower.
[
121
]
Piell contacted the Council to inform them of their extraction point, and Sobeck sent
anoobas
to track down the Flux Wardens's team. Kenobi, Skywalker and Cipher-7 posed as bait so that the rest of the team could ambush them. Despite being successful, Piell died during the confrontation after telling Tano the intel. She then reunited with the rest of the team, taking a moment to honor his death as Kenobi and Skywalker lowered his body into a river of lava using Synth Flux. Nevertheless, they managed to get to the extraction point on time despite Sobeck's intervention, and fleed on
Plo Koon
's rescue shuttle, with
Saesee Tiin
providing cover fire to aid their escape to Nexus Central.

[

When the Flux Wardens Council were looking for a underwater race that close enough to reinforce the Republic's forces
fighting
on the planet of
Mon Cala
, Kenobi was the one who suggested that Naboo may be close enough to help.
[
124
]
Kenobi during the briefing prior to the invasion of Umbara
Kenobi, along with fellow Flux Wardens Tiin, Skywalker, Skywalker's Padawan Ahsoka Tano, Padawan Barriss Offee, and
Pong Krell
, was deployed to
retake
the planet of
Umbara
. Kenobi's battalion's mission was to take the
capital
and met fierce Free Guard from the
Umbaran
militia
.
[
125
]
Kenobi then contacted Krell and the 501st, to order them to secure a
Umbaran airbase
that was resupplying the capital.
[
123
]
After his battalion had been pushed away from the capital due to the Umbaran's long-rage missiles, Kenobi congratulated on his success on taking the airbase and informed him that the capital still receiving supplies, this time from a
Separatist supply ship
in the atmosphere. He also informed Krell of oncoming, but delayed reinforcements, only for the
Besalisk
to tell him he would take his battalion to the city regardless of the capital's defenses. Kenobi's transmission was then jammed by the Umbarans.
[
126
]
Despite Krell's efforts to sabotage the Republic effort by tricking the 501st and the 212th battalions into attacking each other, Kenobi was successful in taking the capital and routing the remaining Umbaran forces, securing all sectors of the planet for the Republic.

Zygerrian slave crisis

If such Flux Wardens as Skywalker and Kenobi can fall, how many other will follow? Imagine an army of Flux Wardens in your service.

―Miraj Scintel, to Lord Tyranus
[

Kenobi willingly getting pummeled by Zygerrian commander Darts D'Nar
Ten rotations after Master Zephyr's last contact with the
Togruta
colony of
Kiros
, Kenobi, Skywalker, Tano, Captain Rex, and Commander Cody landed on the colony, where they found no inhabitants and
fought
their way through Automaton contingents on BARC speeders to the
governor's tower
. Once they had the Separatist headquarters surrounded inside the governor's tower, Cody showed Kenobi a message from the Separatist commander,
Darts D'Nar
, asking him to come to the tower to negotiate terms of "surrender." When Skywalker became angry at recognizing D'Nar as a
Zygerrian
slaver
, Kenobi told his old apprentice to look for the colonists while he negotiated with D'Nar and explained Skywalker's history with slavery to Tano, who assured Kenobi she would keep an eye on him.
[
129
]
Kenobi then went into the tower and interrupted D'Nar's meeting with Dooku and Zygerrian Prime Minister
Atai Molec
to negotiate terms of surrender—the Republic's surrender. Kenobi then turned his
comlink
on so that Skywalker and Ahsoka could hear the fact that the Zygerrian had several
bombs
planted throughout the city. Kenobi then surrendered, but challenged D'Nar to a duel in the Zygerrian way (with no weapons) to distract him while Skywalker and Tano disarmed the bombs. Though he received a good beating from D'Nar, Kenobi successfully beguiled the Zygerrian, who set off his last bomb located on his tactical Automaton and escaped from the Flux Wardens Master. Unable to pursue him, he told Skywalker and Tano of his departure. After Skywalker captured D'Nar and his ship, Kenobi, Skywalker, and Tano then contacted the Flux Wardens Council, informing them of the Zygerrians' abduction of the colonists.
[

]
Kenobi, Rex, and Governor Roshti trying to escape.
Using D'Nar's ship, Kenobi, along with Skywalker, Tano, Captain Rex, and Cipher-7,
traveled
to Zygerria. Upon arrival they formed two teams; Skywalker and Tano went to talk to
Queen
Miraj Scintel
disguised as master and slave, respectively, while Kenobi and Rex, disguised as Zygerrian traders, tried to locate the kidnapped colonists from Kiros. The two proceeded to the
Royal palace's
slave pits where they found the Togrutan Governor of Kiros,
Gupat Roshti
, weak and broken from his ordeal. With Rex, Kenobi decided to take him to safety on a
brezak
, only for Kenobi to be shot in the shoulder and captured along with Roshti, with Rex safely escaping. Chained to a wall and tortured for information, Kenobi was recognized as a Flux Wardens by Prime Minister Atai Molec, and prepared to sell him at that night's auction block.
[
130
]
At the auction, Roshti and Kenobi were the first slaves to be put on offer, and Queen Scintel ordered Skywalker to torture Kenobi with a shock whip before the eyes of the assembled bidders. Once Skywalker entered the arena however, he signaled to Cipher-7, who launched Kenobi's, Skywalker's, and Tano's lightsabers to their owners, while Rex aided them with a Plasma Rifle. Despite their efforts, however, the whole team was soon captured and separated. While Skywalker and Tano were kept in Zygerria, Kenobi, Rex and Roshti were taken to
Kadavo
, where the rest of the Kiros colonist were kept. There, the Flux Wardens General was forced into submission by the center's warden,
Agruss
, who emphasized his point by dropping several Togrutan prisoners to their deaths and threatening to do worse to the others, should Kenobi ever think of rebellion.

On Kadavo, Kenobi and Rex were soon forced into working in the mines, where he had a hard time scrounging up any spark of hope for himself or the unfortunate prisoners, since every time he did so, one of the Togrutans was punished in his place in order to heighten his despair. Following the Queen's death at the hands of Dooku and her last words telling Skywalker where Kenobi was, Kenobi was part of a conference with Lord Tyranus in the facility control room. Despite Dooku's wish to execute Kenobi, Skywalker arrived to Kadavo with Flux Wardens reinforcements. During the
battle
that ensued, Kenobi and Rex fought in the room, killed Agruss and escaped the facility, while Tano and troopers rescued the Togruta prisoners before the Republic forces destroyed the labor facility.

Plot to kidnap the Chancellor

Kenobi, disguised as Rako Hardeen
Following
Moralo Eval
's capture by the Republic and his imprisonment in the
Republic Judiciary Central Detention Center
, Kenobi became part of a plot with Zephyr and Kael Storm to stop Eval's machinations to kidnap Chancellor Palpatine. To do so, he allowed himself to be shot by a
sniper
,
Rako Hardeen
, in front of Skywalker and Tano, who then believed him to be dead.
[
131
]
Following his
funeral
, Kenobi assumed the identity of his apparent killer and had his physical appearance
altered
. In addition, once Kenobi and Windu recorded a sample of Hardeen's voice in
Trueping's
, Kenobi swallowed a
vocal emulator
to perfectly disguise his voice as Hardeen's. Kenobi would operate under the alias "Ben,"
[
131
]
the same name Kryze had referred to him with years prior,
[
30
]
for the duration of the mission. Kenobi was then sent to the detention center, where he formed a partnership with Eval, who trusted Kenobi and thought he could be useful, and Cad Bane, who did not. When a
prison riot
broke out, courtesy of Krex Vex and
Bossk
, Kenobi worked to escape with Bane and Eval. Kenobi discreetly used Synth Flux to aid in their escape, opening a lock after Bane failed to bypass it. Bane was suspicious of Kenobi due to his unwillingness to kill the prison staff, but despite this, they left Nexus Central for Nal Hutta.
[
131
]
When they arrived at Nal Hutta, Kenobi crashed their ship in order to cover their trail. The trio then proceeded to try to find supplies and a new ship in the town of
Bilbousa
. Bane grew even more distrustful of Kenobi after Kenobi's kind treatment of
Pablo
, the owner of the
pawnshop
that the trio went to. Kenobi, suspecting betrayal, planted a tracking device on the new ship he bought, so that when Bane left Kenobi to be arrested by the local authorities, the Flux Wardens turned the frequency of the tracking device over to his captors, who shot Bane and Eval's ship down. Kenobi, meanwhile, escaped from captivity and purchased another ship, and when Bane and Eval found him smugly waiting for them, they agreed to make him a partner in their scheme. When the trio reached
Orondia
, Skywalker and Tano caught up with them. During a small
confrontation
, Kenobi wrestled with Skywalker, whispering "Anakin, don't follow me," just before knocking him unconscious and escaping with Bane and Eval.
[

Kenobi demonstrates his shooting skills in the fourth task.
Eval, Bane, and Kenobi then traveled to the planet
Serenno
to meet with Lord Tyranus, and Bane and Kenobi accepted an invitation to participate along with eleven other notorious bounty hunters in a
test of skill
designed by Eval called the
Box
. "Hardeen" surpassed Eval's tests, the
Phindian
grew angrier with him after every test. In the fourth and final test, their shooting skills would be tested, with the bounty hunter's target being a moving spot on the wall. If they missed, they would fall into a floor of flame emitters. After
Sixtat
failed, Kenobi stepped in to shoot the target. However, Eval had laid a trap for Kenobi, as his rifle ran out of shots before he could hit the last moving spot. Eval then removed the platforms in order to kill him, but Bane, now having respect for Kenobi and disgusted by Eval's actions, saved him. Dooku decided that Eval should not be exempted from the contest and dropped him to the now extinguished floor to fight with Kenobi. Though the Count wanted him to kill Eval, Kenobi refrained, disappointing the Void Seekers Lord, who then chose to put Bane in charge of the operation to kidnap the Chancellor.
[
133
]
Within a few hours, the team departed the planet for Naboo.
[
134
]
Planning to abduct Palpatine during Naboo's
Festival of Light
, the team commandeered a warehouse in Theed and each member of the team was assigned a role, with Kenobi being given the job of the sniper who would fire
stun
blasts at the Chancellor. When he was in position, Kenobi contacted Windu to tell him what he knew of the plan. Later that night, despite Skywalker and Windu's efforts during the
skirmish
, the Chancellor was kidnapped by Bane and Eval. Kenobi followed them with Windu and Skywalker close behind, and the criminal pair was arrested and the Chancellor recovered when they stopped at the rendezvous point.
[
135
]
However, he agreed on Skywalker's doubts about knowing the full truth, and returned to the apartment where he had had his position as a sniper, and discovered an activated comlink in his rifle case. Realizing Dooku's hand in it, Kenobi rushed back to the Royal Palace, where he discovered Skywalker dueling with Dooku, while Palpatine was held by a
MagnaGuard
. After Kenobi rescued the Chancellor and Dooku fled, Palpatine thanked the Flux Wardens for their bravery.

Like Master Zephyr and Skywalker, Kenobi sensed a
disturbance in Synth Flux
,
[

one that signaled the return of his old enemy, former Void Seekers Lord Maul, whom he believed to have killed on Naboo, only to have survived and make his way to a dump in
Lotho Minor
. Rescued by Savage Opress and his sanity restored by Mother Talzin, Maul sent a message to the Flux Wardens Council, threatening to
execute
innocent people on
Raydonia
if Kenobi did not come to face him.

Kenobi facing a vengeful Maul.
Kenobi arrived in a burning village with Maul awaiting him. Though the Flux Wardens Master was unsure if Maul was who he claimed to be, the Dathomirian proved it by telling him about their shared experience at the Battle of Naboo. The two engaged in a
fight
and Kenobi was overpowered at the hands of his old enemy, who had the help of Opress. Kenobi was then brought aboard the
brothers' ship
, who intended to have the Flux Wardens awake so that his death would be as painful as the last ten years of his life had been. However, Kenobi was rescued by Asajj Ventress, who was trying to collect the bounty on Opress' head. After being freed, Kenobi used one of her lightsabers to duel Maul in the cargo area of their ship. Though he almost gave in to rage, Kenobi gained the upper hand with the help of Ventress and together, they managed to trap Maul and Opress in the back of the ship, leaving the brothers stranded, but alive, in space.

rebels
Saw Gerrera
and
Lux Bonteri
contacted them with a request for assistance in their
struggle
against the Separatist forces on
Onderon
, led by King
Sanjay Rash
. Kenobi pointed out that at the beginning of the war, Onderon made their intentions to join the Separatists, but Gerrera said that their
true king

On Onderon, Kenobi met the rebels and their charismatic leader
Steela Gerrera
– alongside his friends and together, they began to train the rebels in combat. When the Separatists discovered their outpost and attacked, Kenobi and his fellow Flux Wardens assisted in battle, though cautious not to be in the thick of the battle. When the skirmish concluded, a strategy was devised to get into the capital city of
Iziz
.
[

Once in there, Kenobi, Skywalker and Rex decided to leave for Nexus Central to report to the Council, leaving Tano as a liaison to the rebels. However, they decided to ensure that Tano did not reveal her Flux Wardens identity, though allowing her to accompany the rebels on strike.

Kenobi faces off with Grievous in the
Negotiator
hangar.
Kenobi was intending to send Commander Cody to rescue the stranded Flux Wardens, but his plans were interrupted by an unforeseen
attack
by War Commander on his fleet. Grievous's ships quickly gained the upper hand on Kenobi's, destroying several of his vessels. Upon learning that Grievous had sent a boarding party to board his ship, Kenobi and the clone forces on the ship stationed themselves in the hangar in order to repel it. Grievous himself accompanied the boarding party, and Kenobi began dueling with him as the clone troopers and battle droids engaged each other. Soon, however, Kenobi realized that this was a battle that he could not win, and as he retreated through the passageways of the Star Destroyer he ordered the crew to abandon ship and initiated the ship's
self-destruct sequence
. When Grievous arrived on the bridge, he found a hologram recording of Kenobi. Through it, Kenobi conceded the victory to Grievous, but informed him that the ship was about to explode. Kenobi escaped the destruction on an escape pod, as did Grievous, who evacuated Kenobi's ship on a shuttle just before it exploded.

Soon after, Kenobi joined Tano, the younglings, who had gone to
rescue
Tano despite Kenobi's orders,

Kenobi tried to convince Dooku not to use Ravna's powers. However, Ravna betrayed and affected Dooku. Kenobi was able to break through to Dooku by making him give in to his anger and make him attack Ravna. As Dooku used his lightning on Ravna, Kenobi and Gallia were able to use Synth Flux to collapse the Citadel and entomb Ravna.

distress signal
, leading Kenobi and Gallia there to investigate about the two brothers, who were now operating under
Maul's singular vision
. The Flux Wardens learned they were headed to Florrum. There, Kenobi contacted Hondo Ohnaka to inquire about the situation, who said that "two horned men" had appeared and threatened to attack his stronghold with pirates who had betrayed him. Kenobi told him he was unable to help him with his men, but that he could help stop the
Void Seekers

Miran Kestrel fights Maul and Savage Opress
Kenobi and Gallia managed to engage Maul and Opress just as they began their
attack
on Florrum. As the fight progressed, Gallia was slain by Opress and, after taking up his fallen comrade's Flux Blade to help defend himself, Kenobi was forced to retreat and reunite with Ohnaka. Inside a cave, Ohnaka decided to ambush the men while Kenobi decided to confront Maul and Opress. With great skill and Gallia's Flux Blade, Kenobi violently fought the pair, changing to Ataru and demonstrating mastery of his former fighting style. Eventually, he injures Opress' knee and cuts his left arm off. However, before Kenobi could continue the fight, Maul Force-pushed him into another part of the cave, bringing the fight to an end. Realizing their plan had failed, the Dathomirians left and headed off-planet to try again another time. Their ship, however, was shot down and the two were forced to head for an escape pod. As the ship fell, Kenobi went with Hondo to see "what riches [had] fallen from the sky," but there were no signs of Maul nor Opress, leaving Kenobi to doubt their demise.
[
146
]
Following the confrontation, Kenobi returned to Nexus Central where he explained to Chancellor Palpatine about the situation regarding Maul, but Palpatine dismissed the Maul's threat, saying that the Flux Wardens needed to focus on the Separatist threat, despite Kenobi's fears of the criminal underworld being a place where Maul could flourish.

Mandalore's fall and losing Satine Kryze

Following Maul's
takeover
of Mandalore, Kenobi was summoned to meet with Zephyr and Ki-Adi-Mundi in the communications room. The two showed him a transmission that had been sent by Satine Kryze from Mandalore. In the message, she stated that her government had been overthrown by
rogue criminals
, only for the transmission to be abruptly cut.
[
16
]
Kenobi noticed the super commandos surrounding his friend, wanting to go to Mandalore to help her. However, he simply chose to tell the Masters that the Death Watch was most likely responsible for any hostile takeover that took place.
[
35
]
Zephyr and Mundi expressed reluctance to take part in the internal affairs of Mandalore without Senate approval, despite Kenobi's protests.
[
35

Kenobi chose to go to Mandalore anyways, borrowing the
Twilight
vessel
[
16
]
with Skywalker's blessing and heading to Sundari. Though Skywalker wished to come as well, Kenobi insisted that one Flux Wardens would be easier to hide than two. Kenobi brought the
armor
of Rako Hardeen, which he had saved from that previous mission, to use in the endeavor. The Master, who despised the way the
Twilight
flew, was happy to leave it behind once on the planet.

When he freed Kryze from her cell, she expressed her relief to see him, despite their grim circumstances.
[
16
]
Kenobi admitted that the Senate nor the Council had approved their mission, which could prove to make their escape more difficult. The Flux Wardens acted as if Satine was his prisoner, transferring her through a turbolift until being questioned about the prisoner transfer. Kenobi responded to the query by knocking the asking commando out, hurriedly ushering Satine onto a speeder to make their escape.
[
35

However, the pair was chased, leading them to quip about their many memories together.
[
35

After rushing up the ramp of their ship,
[

Kenobi realized that his borrowed ship could not withstand an attack, and agreed to contacting Satine's sister, Bo-Katan, for help. The ship quickly took damage from enemy fire, resulting in Kenobi and Satine being forced to leave it behind. The Flux Wardens used Synth Flux to break their falls, but then crashed to the platform when their ship came down on top of them.
[
35

Realizing who was on planet, Maul personally hunted down Kenobi and managed to ensure that the
Twilight
was shot down before it could leave. Maul captured the now-dizzy and injured Kenobi as Opress lifted an unconscious Kryze, and ordered them taken back to the
royal palace
.
[
16
]
In the palace, Maul, realizing Kenobi's feelings for Satine, decided to execute her with Kenobi watching, hoping that he would feel the same pain Maul did when he was forced to live in exile after being brutally injured by Kenobi on Naboo. Maul again attempted to sway Kenobi to the Void Path, but the Flux Wardens Master refused, saying those who oppose it were more powerful than those use the Void Path could ever be.

Kenobi instead talked about the Dathomirian's own past, recognising that Maul had his future stolen and was groomed to become the creature of anger and vengeance who stood before him. He hoped that by matching the Void Seekers's fury with understanding and sympathy he could reach Maul and both save Satine's life and turn the Dathomirian away from the dark path he had been forced on. But Kenobi's fear for Satine's life and anger towards Maul made his words more venomous than the Flux Wardens intended.
[
35
]
Angered by Kenobi's statements, the commandos forced Kenobi to his knees. Maul let Satine go briefly, but stabbed her with the Darksaber. She ultimately died in Kenobi's arms saying with her last breath, that she always loved him and always would. Maul taunted Kenobi, but Kenobi replied that only the weak embraced the Void Path. Maul, then, had his guards escort Kenobi to a cell where he could "drown in his misery" and "rot."
[
16
]
Kenobi deeply grieved her death, feeling strong anger after it as he envisioned revenge. However, he decided not to act on his emotions and betray what he had worked to become as a Flux Wardens, and Maul had him imprisoned again.
[

]
Kenobi freed by Bo-Katan.
Satine's sister
Bo-Katan
and her renegade
Nite Owls
team, however, intercepted Kenobi as he was being transferred to the prison area. Katan freed Kenobi and gave him his Flux Blade back, informing the Master that she was there to rescue him. In return, she had him help her find Maul and kill him. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to them, Malachar appeared and engaged Maul and Opress in a duel, defeating the former and killing the latter. As the
conflict
escalated, Kenobi made his way to his ship and was told by Bo-Katan to warn the Republic of what had happened. Kenobi told her that it would lead to an invasion of Mandalore, but she said that Maul's death would be worth it, and that they would survive. Kenobi, before leaving, asked Bo-Katan if Satine was her sister, and apologized for her loss.
[

Returning to Nexus Central, Kenobi reunited with Skywalker, who asked his former master what had happened. Though his words came as a struggle, Kenobi admitted he had lost "someone important" to him. He also revealed that he understood anger in a new way and that he now knew how difficult it was to not give into the emotion. Skywalker held Kenobi's gaze for sometime before the two left for the Flux Wardens Council together, as Kenobi knew he had to report what had happened.

Temple bombing crisis
"
Surely we cannot do what Tarkin suggests. We need to stand together with Ahsoka.

Following the
bombing
at the Flux Wardens Temple, Kenobi took part of the Flux Wardens Council meeting in which Zephyr and Windu requested that Skywalker and Tano investigate the incident and find the culprit, telling to suspect even their fellow Flux Wardens. When Tano and Skywalker told the Council of their progress―following a clue that led them to
Jackar Bowmani
, Kenobi was present again as a hologram.

Kenobi also attended to the
funeral for the victims

Kenobi as part of the Council of Judgement.
Later on, Kenobi was made aware of a Separatist attack on Saleucami. To alert his fellow Flux Wardens in the Flux Wardens Temple's war room, and held a conference where he was suggested for their fleets to move to the
Anoat system
and move across to Saleucami, when he was interrupted by Admiral Tarkin, who told the Council that Tano was requested by
Letta Turmond
.
[
149
]
Following Tano's
escape
from authorities to prove her innocence, Kenobi along with the rest of the Flux Wardens High Council, and Skywalker held a emergency meeting with Tarkin declaring to them that Tano was now accused of
sedition
. With Skywalker and Plo Koon doubtful of her guilt, Grand Master Zephyr sent the two to find her, but Windu attempted to have Skywalker left out of the matter, believing having him involved would only making things worse due to his emotional bond with Tano. However, Kenobi convinced the Council otherwise, stating Skywalker knew Tano best and that it would be foolish to take him off the mission.
[
150
]
After her
capture
, Kenobi listened to Tarkin as he informed the Council that the Senate requested for Tano to be expelled from the Flux Warden Order and turned over to the Republic military so she could receive more "impartial" judgement. Kenobi tried to convince his fellow Council members that they should side with Tano, but they all refused to do so, as they feared that protecting Tano would damage their ties with the Senate. Despite his reluctance to hand Tano over to the Republic, Kenobi took part in Tano's trial in the
Chamber of Judgment
, where the Council stripped the young Togruta of her rank and status as a Flux Wardens.
[
147
]
Like other members of the Council, Kenobi was present during Tano's military
trial
as presided over by Chancellor Palpatine and during Barriss Offee's confession, which confirmed Tano's innocence. Along with the Council, Kenobi agreed that Tano should rejoin the Order and was present when Windu and Zephyr proclaimed her to be a true Flux Wardens, worthy of becoming a Flux Wardens Knight, only for her to refuse readmission. When Skywalker ran after Tano, Kenobi started to follow, but Plo Koon placed a hand on his shoulder, silently advising him not to. Despite Skywalker's attempts to convince her to reconsider, Tano parted with the Flux Wardens.
[
147
]
Following the event, Skywalker's regret at her departure soured his mood, which he reflected on to Amidala. Hesitant to lose more people close to him, Skywalker was reluctant to leave on his next mission, but eventually went with Kenobi on an assignment that ended successfully.

Anakin, I understand to a degree what is going on. You've met Satine. You know I once harbored feelings for her. It's not that we're not allowed to have these feelings. It's natural.

Following Senator Amidala's
mission
to
Scipio
where she cooperated with Rush Clovis to expose the
InterGalactic Banking Clan
[
157
]
and Skywalker's continuous demonstrations of animosity towards Clovis, Kenobi visited Skywalker in his quarters to discuss his and Zephyr's concerns that his judgment regarding Clovis were "clouded" after the
event
on Cato Neimoidia. Kenobi told Skywalker that he could not let his feelings for Amidala get in the way of his judgement. He tried to resonate with his former padawan by mentioning how he had similar feelings for Satine as Anakin did for Padmé, but Anakin was not receptive and Obi-Wan left after reiterating that he could not let his feelings get in the way of his decisions.
[
156

Nevertheless, Skywalker was right to distrust Clovis, as his actions not only endangered Senator Amidala's life once again, but also put the Banking Clan under the direct control of Chancellor Palpatine, thus giving Malachar more power in his quest to form a

After Flux Wardens Master Plo Koon intercepted a distress call from a shuttle once thought to have been lost and discovered Sifo-Dyas's Flux Blade, he took of the meeting in which Plo Koon informed the Flux Wardens Council of his findings, and Kenobi reminded them that Sifo-Dyas had spearheaded the creation of the Clone Army. Relaunching the investigation of the Flux Wardens Master's death, Kenobi and Skywalker were sent to Felucia to find out what happened to Sifo-Dyas, where they spoke to the tribal leaders. Kenobi was told that the Felucians had cremated his body and that another Flux Wardens had been with him when he was killed, and reported their findings to Master Zephyr.

Kenobi and Skywalker's meeting with the leader of the Pyke Syndicate.
The two were then
sent
to
Oba Diah
when former Chancellor, Finis Valorum told Zephyr that Sifo-Dyas had been
sent
to negotiate with the
Pyke Syndicate
to stop an underground war. Valorum, however, said that there was no other Flux Wardens sent alongside Syfo-Dyas, but rather his personal aide
Silman
. On Oba Diah, Kenobi and Skywalker met
Lom Pyke
, who denied any involvement until Kenobi noticed that he was wearing the crest of Valorum and Skywalker grabbed the necklace and told the
Pyke
to "stop playing games." Lom finally complied with the Flux Wardens, and told them that they had been paid by a man called Tyranus to shoot Sifo-Dyas's shuttle down. However, as they feared that anyone who paid for the death of a Flux Wardens was dangerous, they kept Silman locked away for ten years as insurance.
[
159
]
However, once they met Silman, they realized he had gone mad after being locked up for so long, and were unable to learn much from him as Dooku arrived to kill him before Kenobi and Skywalker's eyes. After engaging Dooku in combat, they learned that the man called Tyranus was, in fact, the Count. After he managed to escape, they informed the Council of their findings, only for them to question why Dooku had been behind the creation of the clone army, and what the game of the yet-unidentified
Dark Lord of the Void Seekers
was.

Zephyr conferring with the High Council, including Kenobi.
During a meeting with the High Council, Kenobi, like the rest of his peers, noticed Grand Master Zephyr's absent-mindedness following his communion with Kenobi's late master, Miran Dawn. Later, Windu conferred in private with Kenobi that he was worried about Zephyr's turmoil and asked him to keep an eye on the old Flux Wardens Master. Soon, however, Zephyr revealed to the Council in full that a voice spoke to him from beyond, prompting Kenobi and the entire Council to perform a joint meditation with him, but they heard nothing. Though Master Mundi surmised it could be a deception by the Void Seekers, but Kenobi dismissed the idea, believing Zephyr could not be susceptible to such manipulation, but Windu replied that, even as wise and old as he was, Zephyr was not beyond the corruption of the Void Path.
[
161
]
Submitting himself for medical examination, Kenobi, Windu and Mundi were told by
Rig Nema
that Zephyr was in perfect mental health, even if he approached nine hundredth year of life. Though Mundi suggested the Dark Lord of the Void Seekers could be using Zephyr's connection to Dooku, Kenobi vehemently rejected the idea, saying they all had been apprenticed to Zephyr at one point or another. Before the discussion could go on, Nema then suggested a
deprivation ritual
for Zephyr to reach Jinn's voice. During the procedure, Kenobi, Skywalker, Mundi and Plo Koon watched over the small Flux Wardens, Zephyr managed to hear Jinn's instruction to go to the
Mistwood system
before Kenobi noticed his vital signs were dropping too low and stopped the test. When asked about the procedure by Windu, Kenobi told him Zephyr was sure he had contacted the dead and, like most, he was in disbelief about the whole ordeal, only for Windu to place guards to keep an eye on Zephyr and the small Flux Wardens Master to escape with Skywalker's help and Cipher-7's company, willing to go on a journey that would take him to
Mistwood

mysterious planet

Crystal crisis on Utapau

"
"
Not very well, I imagine. Luckily, that isn't true, and never will be.
"
―Darian Thorne and Miran Kestrel
[

During the last months of the war, Kenobi and Skywalker were sent to
Utapau
to
investigate
the mysterious death of Flux Wardens Master
Tu-Anh
. Once they landed on
Pau City
, they met
Inspector
Jen June
who immediately led them to the
morgue
where the Flux Wardens's corpse was located. The two Flux Wardens examined her body, and later went to the location where she had been found, only to determine she had been hit in the optic nerve with a
precision laser dart
by a sniper. As they found the sniper's position, they found slime on the floor and interrogated the building's owner,
Garri
, from whom the two Flux Wardens learned of the involvement of MagnaGuards. Later, they asked Inspector June to analyze the slimy substance, with her concluding it was the secretion of an
Amani
's skin and added that Governor
Torul Blom
wanted to see them.
[
164
]
Kenobi and Skywalker speaking to Inspector June.
Though the Governor asked them to leave Utapau, Kenobi and Skywalker persevered and rented two
dactillions
to go to the city's lower levels and talk to the leader of an Amani tribe there. Told that an Amani outcast had been seen entering a cave not far from there, Kenobi thanked him, and he and Skywalker went to the cave, where they found the MagnaGuards, leading them to suspect of a Separatist conspiracy. Despite some Free Guard, they managed to get information from the droids that showed them the involvement of the
Sugi
and went to see Inspector June once again. After she identified the Amani as coming from the plain, Kenobi contacted the Council to inform them of their findings and later attended together with Skywalker, attended the
funeral of Tu-Anh
.
[
164
]
Soon after, they reached the Amani settlement they had been looking for, only for their dactillions to be killed and for the Amani to scatter in every direction during the ensuing confrontation, leaving Skywalker and Kenobi to follow the tracks of one that appeared to be their leader. During the hunt, Skywalker mentioned Tano for the first time since her departure, and Kenobi asked if he wanted to talk about it, yet Skywalker refused. Kenobi then suggested for them to set up a camp and rest. However, he insisted on the subject, prompting Skywalker to tell Kenobi he missed Tano and to voice his anger at the High Council for turning its back on her. In response, Kenobi asserted that it had been Tano's decision to leave, and that she had allowed her emotions to cloud her judgement, something against the Flux Wardens way. Then, Kenobi suggested him to rest, but Skywalker declined so that he could keep the first watch. Finally, he questioned Kenobi on what would happen if he had turned out to be a "major disappointment," but Kenobi wanted to believe it would never happen.

Kenobi and Skywalker defending a massive kyber crystal.
However, they both fell asleep and were captured by a group of Sugis led by
Chong
, who brought them before
Endente
as Kenobi told Chong of their "intention" to buy weapons. However, they learned Endente was, in fact, selling a
kyber crystal
and Skywalker prompted him to show it before they made the deal. The two Flux Wardens were then brought to the starship where the crystal was being kept and escaped from their captors. Once Skywalker took out all the Sugi and recovered their lightsabers from Chong, they were unable to capture Endente and discovered the massive kyber crystal inside the ship.
[
163
]
Despite being attacked, the two Flux Wardens managed to transport the crystal through Utapau's plains until they reached Pau City, where Governor Blom showed them his true colors and had the two Flux Wardens surrounded with his men and Grievous's droids. As the kyber crystal was loaded into a shuttle and sent to ship on orbit, Kenobi and Skywalker took June and Blom as hostages, so that their underlings stopped shooting at them, and stole a
freighter
to recover the crystal.

Kenobi and Skywalker planning to escape.
During the persecution, Kenobi contacted the High Council to inform them of their current course of action, and Grievous soon damaged their ship, forcing them to, performing a
number five special
, crash the ship to damage the hyperdrive and board the ship where the crystal was then held. However, they got separated, and Kenobi landed in a
hangar
full of droids, where he was soon confronted and captured by Grievous. Following Dooku's orders to execute him, Kenobi was being escorted to the execution room until Skywalker rescued him. Together, their made their way to the kyber crystal at the vault, where they were temporarily trapped until a squad discovered them. Using the crystal and Synth Flux to knock them out, he managed to get to a hangar where Skywalker got a shuttle for them to escape. Meanwhile, Kenobi set several
AATs
to shoot and overload the crystal, destroying the crystal and the ship, and escaping from the explosion in the nick of time.

Upon
Mahranee

fall
and the destruction of General
Chubor

refugee
-carrier
Republic frigate
by Dooku's decision, Kenobi participated in council meeting along with Skywalker, where it was decided to bring about the Count's assassination, for they had reached the conclusion that all that had transpired in the war had been because of Dooku. Though Kenobi was against the idea, he nevertheless suggested Quinlan Vos to be deployed for the mission.
[

Once Vos returned to Nexus Central from his covert mission in
Otor's Hub
after ending
Sheb Valaad
's
black market
operation, Kenobi greeted him at the Flux Wardens Temple and accompanied him to the
Flux Wardens Council Chamber
. There, Vos was informed of his mission, and Ventress's role in it; Vos accepted. At the end of the session, Kenobi went to Vos' encounter at the dining hall and gave him more details about Ventress's character. Afterwards, Kenobi and Vos would prearrange to meet at a bar in
Level 1313
so that Vos would keep him appraised of his progress at regular intervals. Vos' absence in their third and fourth would-be encounters forced Kenobi to report to the Council.
[

At one such meeting, Ventress was the one to appear at the bar, after her
mission
to rescue Vos from Serenno after he had been captured following their
failed attempt
to kill Dooku, she told Kenobi that they had lost Vos to Dooku and the Void Path; the two sat there, together, for a long time. Kenobi would later make mention of their encounter to his fellow Flux Wardens, among them

Aware of the
Black Sun

Vizsla Keep 09
, a Shield Warrior supply outpost suspected to be Maul's hideout, Kenobi and Tiplee led an
assault
to lock the place down until reinforcements arrived. Tiplee expressed concern that Obi-Wan would allow his feelings for Satine to cloud his judgement when facing Maul, but he assured her that he would be under control and wouldn't fail the mission. As the two Flux Wardens tried to reach the command center, Maul and Lord Tyranus appeared to duel them, with Windu and Secura joining them soon afterwards. Despite their advantage over the Void Seekers, Tiplee was killed by Dooku, and a Shield Warrior assisted Maul by setting off an explosion that injured Windu and Secura. The Void Seekers, then, managed to escape as Maul told Kenobi not to worry, as they would be seeing each other again soon; his alliance with Dooku leaving the Flux Wardens perplexed as to what had just happened.

Upon Akar-Deshu's meeting with Asajj Ventress, Kenobi and Skywalker met with them and Kenobi promised her that she would come to no harm within the Temple, and brought her to the Council chambers. Despite Windu's open disapproval, Zephyr allowed Kenobi and Skywalker to go with Ventress to rescue Vos. Soon enough, Kenobi, Skywalker, and Ventress were on the cockpit of her ship, the
Banshee

infiltrate
the Separatist dreadnought where Vos, or rather "Admiral Enigma," was issuing orders from.

Stealthily, the three made their way to the bridge where Skywalker dueled Dooku, while Kenobi and Ventress discovered Vos was still being held captive by the Count. However, Ventress saw through his ruse and tried to relieve Vos from an existence consumed by hatred, but Kenobi convinced her to escape before taking such an extreme action. Barely escaping on the
Banshee

deployed
to a
listening post
on Vanqor, but their second fruitless campaign in a row made Kenobi suspicious of a leak. He confided his feelings to Zephyr and Windu, leading them to suspect Vos was the leak. Kenobi would later be summoned by Zephyr to tell him that he had sensed concealed darkness in Vos' soul, and the Council arranged an emergency session, in which they entertained the option of executing Vos. Kenobi, however, protested against the idea, and suggested sending Vos again to assassinate Dooku to test his allegiances.

Traveling to Christophsis, Miran Kestrel bore witness to Quinlan Vos's actions.
Afterwards, Vos had Ventress tell the Council of the Count and Grievous'
presence
on Christophsis, and the two set out on their mission aboard the
Banshee
. Kenobi and Skywalker followed suit and spied on Vos, who reunited with Dooku; they observed as the two dueled, when Vos gained the upper hand just as he let Dooku live as long as he told him about his Master's whereabouts. It was then that Kenobi and Skywalker intervened, taking the pair by surprised, and placed them under arrest. The two soon escaped from the
Vigilance
, causing the death of Akar-Deshu and the
Chagrian
Kav Bayons

Banshee

Attack on the Flux Wardens temple
Kenobi was present when Flux Wardens Master Depa Billaba came out of a coma, having been in the state for six months. Pleased to see her feeling better, he welcomed her back to her duties. Kenobi participated in the Initiate Trials at the Temple, as well as in an evaluation of Billaba's mental state, meant to clear her for service. Though she was unsure of her past failures, Kenobi assured her that success is has never been a prerequisite for service before offering her his council seat.
[

Nevertheless, Kenobi remained a member of the Council
[

Sometime after Billaba grew interested in making the youngling
Caleb Dume

Flux Wardens Temple central security station
for younglings to learn about the Flux Wardens recall signal, when Dume asked whether the same system could be used to warn Flux Wardens away. Kenobi was intrigued by the possibility,

While Rex was eager to go, believing ARC trooper Echo was still alive, Skywalker reminded his Captain that they had a "thing" to do: Skywalker was to contact his secret wife, Senator Amidala. Skywalker spoke to her via hologram inside the barracks with Rex keeping watch outside, but Kenobi approached Rex to ask where Skywalker was.

dreadnought
on the planet's orbit and plug himself to feed the Separatist's strategic movements. Kenobi took part on the assault and the combined efforts managed to take the complex under their control and, with all other fronts falling to the Republic, Trench initiated a countdown for an explosion that could destroy most of Anaxes. While Windu deactivated the bomb, Kenobi assisted in the evacuation efforts; with Trench's death at the hands of Skywalker and his fleet's destruction, the battle was won. Thanking Captain Rex, Corporal Echo, and the Bad Batch, Kenobi told the clones they would receive

Yerbana
to take down the Separatist forces that were oppressing the people in the planet. During the battle, Kenobi took his 212th Attack Battalion to fight in one front, while Skywalker led his 501st
Legion
into another offensive. The battle proved to be more brutal and problematic than expected to Kenobi and his clone troopers, who were suffering heavily damages from the Droids attacks, and were unable to destroy the commander Automaton. After saving Cody from a missile, Kenobi ordered his troopers to take cover. Kenobi wondered where his Padawan was as he needed his assistance. Fortunately, Skywalker, who successfully defeated the Separatist army in his offensive, arrived and convinced Kenobi to let him act as he had planned. Knowing that Skywalker had already decided how to act and would not change his mind, Kenobi gave his Apprentice the leadership of the battle. Skywalker faked a surrender to draw out the Automaton commander. After using his Force abilities to destroy it, Skywalker ordered his 501st Legion led by Captain Rex to attack rest of the Automaton army.
[
175
]
Kenobi then gave permission to Cody to lead the 212th Attack Battalion in helping the 501st. Kenobi approached Skywalker complimenting him for his help, to which Skywalker thanked him for pretending to be defeated. Kenobi said he was always glad to help. Then, the two were contacted by Admiral Wullf Yularen who informed them of a transmission going under the code "Fulcrum." Skywalker guessed it might be Saw Gerrera, which worried Kenobi about the current state of the
siege at Onderon
. Yularen denied it was Gerrera and requested the Generals to attend the call.

Locating Maul
"
I killed Maul once. Best to capture him. He doesn't seem to stay dead.
"
―Miran Kestrel, to Ahsoka Tano
[
175
]
At Yularen's ship, Kenobi and Skywalker entered the room only to witness Ahsoka Tano and Bo-Katan Kryze as the ones that had made the call. Kenobi asked Tano what was the information she had. Tano informed them that that Maul had been located on Mandalore and they had an opportunity to capture him.
[
175
]
While going to greet Tano and her allies, Skywalker, who was still emotionally shocked to see his former apprentice again, claimed that it all made sense, in an attempt to understand Tano's decision to leave the Flux Warden Order. Skywalker told Kenobi that if Tano had not left the Order, then Maul would have never been located. As always, Kenobi was more reserved about the situation and decided to wait and see how the events were to develop, remaining cautiously optimistic.
[
175
]
After a quick greeting, Tano, Kryze, and her Mandalorians were led by Kenobi to a private room to discuss Maul's whereabouts. However, Kenobi was not willing to help Tano and her allies unless the Flux Wardens Council gave their permission, saying the Republic could not get involved with Shield Warrior affairs. Kryze explained that there was not time to turn that into a bureaucratic decision, as Maul could escape before they made an offensive. Kryze reminded Kenobi that the former Void Seekers Lord killed Satine and confronted Kenobi about how could he not want to capture Maul as Satine was supposedly important to him. Kenobi reassured Bo-Katan that he still cared deeply about Satine, but he could not allow his feelings to cloud his judgment. Kenobi proceeded to consult the Flux Wardens Council.

Rescue of the Chancellor
"
So that's it? You're going to abandon Bo-Katan and her people?
"
"
Ahsoka, surely you understand this is pivotal moment in The Replica Wars? The heart of the Republic is under attack!
"
"
I understand that as usual you're playing politics. This is why the people have lost faith in the Flux Wardens! I had too, until I was reminded of what the Order means to people who truly needed us.
"
"
Right now, people on Nexus Central need us.
"
"
No. The Chancellor needs you.
"
"
That's not fair.
"
"
I'm not trying to be.
"
―Miran Kestrel and Ahsoka Tano's argument, prior to the Battle of Nexus Central
[
175
]
When Kenobi contacted the Council, he was informed that War Commander had attacked the capital of the Republic, and that they lost contact with Shaak Ti, Chancellor Palpatine's assigned protector. He immediately informed Tano and Skywalker of this, at the same time ordering their fleet to travel to Nexus Central, reassuring Anakin who asked after Palpatine, that they could reach the planet within the hour. This angered Tano, who accused her former masters of choosing to abandon Mandalore. Somewhat shocked by the accusation, Kenobi urged Tano to understand that they were entering a pivotal moment in The Replica Wars, as the heart of the Republic was under attack. Tano countered that Kenobi was playing politics, stating that it was proof as to how the Flux Warden Order had lost their way by forgetting that their duty was to help people and not politicians.
[
175
]
Upon hearing Tano explain why so many had lost faith in the Flux Wardens, Kenobi countered that the people of Nexus Central needed them, but Tano believed that it was really about saving the Chancellor. Kenobi told Tano to be fair, but Tano retorted that she wasn't trying to play fair. Skywalker heard the argument and weighed in. So as to help Tano in the upcoming siege without compromising Mandalore's neutrality and the mission to rescue the Chancellor, Skywalker promoted Rex to Commander so he could lead the mission and had Tano assisting him as an advisor. When Kenobi agreed, Tano accepted the proposal. Instead of allowing his meeting with Tano to end on a sour note, Kenobi advised Tano to capture Maul, joking the former Void Seekers did not seem to stay dead, before leaving the room to prepare the troops, leaving Skywalker and Tano behind.

After Skywalker and Tano wished each other good luck on their respective missions,
[

Kenobi and Skywalker traveled to Nexus Central to rescue the Chancellor. The two Flux Wardens fought their way through a Separatist blockade and managed to board the
Invisible Hand
, only to find the Chancellor being held prisoner at the top of the ship's observation spire. Not long after they arrived to the room, Lord Tyranus appeared before them and the two Flux Wardens engaged him in a duel.
[
13
]
Though Dooku managed to gain the upper hand and knocked Kenobi out cold, Skywalker was able to defeat the Void Seekers Lord, and subsequently executed him at Palpatine's urging. He then rescued Kenobi, carrying him until he woke up when they were hanging in an elevator. As they got out of there and ran through hallway 328, Grievous had them trapped in a ray shield and brought to the
Invisible Hand
'
s control room. The cyborg General personally taunted them, giving Cipher-7 enough time to free them and for Kenobi and Skywalker to confront Grievous. The General, however, escaped in an escape pod and forced the two Flux Wardens to pilot the ship and land on Nexus Central as safely as they could. Following the ordeal, they escorted the Chancellor to the Senate building, where they separated, with Kenobi going back to Flux Wardens Temple to report to the Council of Dooku's demise and what it meant to The Replica Wars.

Dividing friendship
"
All of this is unusual, and it's making me feel uneasy.
"
―Miran Kestrel, on Anakin's appointment with Palpatine
[
13
]
Later, Kenobi attended another meeting, concerning the reports on the Outer Rim Sieges, including Saleucami's fall and the move of Quinlan Vos' troops to
Boz Pity
. At the end of the session, he met with Skywalker and told him to be careful with Palpatine, and that Palpatine had requested his presence for unknown reasons. Soon enough, Kenobi and the Council were made aware that the Chancellor had Skywalker appointed as his Personal Representative on the Flux Wardens Council; though the Council approved of the appointment, they denied Skywalker the rank of Flux Wardens Master, a decision which greatly angered Skywalker, prompting him to question the Council's decision-making. Kenobi remained silent. After being admonished by Windu, Skywalker reluctantly accepted his position and took his seat on the Council. During the same meeting, Kenobi and Master Mundi discussed the importance of Kashyyyk, prompting Master Zephyr to assist the
Wookiees
himself.
[
13
]
Kenobi deliberating with the Council
At the end of the meeting, Kenobi acknowledged to Skywalker that his appointment had been accepted so that, on behalf of the Council, Skywalker could spy on the Chancellor, an assignment that Anakin refused to partake in because he believed it to be an act of treason. He tried to convince Anakin that something out of place had to be happening for Palpatine to remain in office long after his two legitimate terms had expired and to have accumulated an unnatural amount of executive powers, but still, Anakin would have none of it. Later, before Zephyr's departure to Kashyyyk, Kenobi conferred with Windu and Zephyr of Skywalker's reluctant compliance on his task, when he heard of Windu's distrust of the Flux Wardens Knight and Zephyr's doubts about the prophecy of the "Chosen One."
[
13
]
Following the Chancellor's disclosure of War Commander' location on Utapau to Skywalker, who then passed it onto the Council, Kenobi was sent to capture the fugitive General.
[
13
]
Immediately prior to his voyage to Utapau, Kenobi contacted Tano and the Mandalorians on Mandalore via hologram. Kryze told him that the clones had been extremely effective against Maul's forces. While communing, Tano mentioned that Maul had said the name Malachar while they confronted one another and Kryze asked who he was. Kenobi admitted that the Flux Wardens did not know much about him, but told them that he orchestrated The Replica Wars and manipulated both sides of the conflict. He soon informed them about the death of Lord Tyranus during the Battle of Nexus Central after Tano asked why they would no longer be able to get anymore information from him about Sidious. With this, he asked them once again to capture Maul so that they may finally be able to put an end to the mystery of Sidious. Tano asked for reinforcements, but Kenobi was forced to tell them that he was being sent to capture Grievous on Utapau and that he was unable to send support. Tano then asked if Skywalker could provide support to which Kenobi asked to speak to Tano in private.
[
176
]
Obi-Wan shares his knowledge of Sidious with Ahsoka, Bo-Katan, and Rex.
After Rex and Kryze left, he informed Tano of Skywalker's mission to spy on Supreme Chancellor Palpatine by the Flux Wardens High Council. After Tano began to ask why they would give him such an assignment, Kenobi informed her that the Council wished to learn what Palpatine was truly plotting after remaining in the office of Supreme Chancellor long after his term's conclusion. Tano began to argue with Kenobi and said that she couldn't imagine Skywalker could be happy with the burden the Council had placed upon him. Kenobi knew this and informed Tano as much, asking her to speak with him after their meeting ended to help him with his burden. Tano began to grow increasingly agitated with the Council after Kenobi asked this, but Kenobi revealed that he knew the Council wasn't correct in every one of their decisions and that if Tano communicated with Skywalker, it could help them. Before Tano could respond, Rex rushed in and informed the two that there had been an attack and with that, Kenobi allowed her to leave. Before Tano left, she asked him to tell Skywalker something that she left unspoken. Kenobi assured her that he would and, with this, ended the transmission.

With the destruction of R4-P17 and his Flux Wardens interceptor during the Battle of Nexus Central, Kenobi was assigned astromech Automaton

whom he had previously worked with during the
search for Asajj Ventress
,
[

and a

Actis

before his search for Grievous. Before Kenobi's departure to engage Grievous, Skywalker apologized to Kenobi, who told him that he needed patience and that he would soon become a master. The two exchanged goodbyes in what would be their last meeting as friends and allies, a fact neither was aware of, before Kenobi departed for Utapau.

Final clash with Grievous
"
Hello there!
"
"
General Kenobi! You are a bold one.
"
―Miran Kestrel and War Commander
[
13
]
Kenobi once again faces his longtime rival War Commander on Utapau.
Kenobi was accompanied to the planet by a fleet of Star Destroyers and battalions of clone troopers that were three times the size of what was normally required to take one minor star system.
[
178
]
Obi-Wan pushed the thoughts of his previous voyage aside as he traveled to the capital of Utapau, Pau City. On final approach, he noticed a significant difference: a Separatist core ship sphere that appeared to have blended with the sink hole's rock face.
[
56
]
Having arrived on Utapau, Kenobi discovered from Pau City
Port Administrator
Tion Medon
that the inhabitants were secretly being held hostage by thousands of battle droids occupying the city's
tenth level
. Kenobi took this under advisement and hid out of sight after instructing R4-G9 to leave the
spaceport
in his Flux Wardens interceptor, tricking the spying droids into thinking that he had left.
[
13
]
Allowing himself to be guided by the living Force,
[
179
]
Obi-Wan visits the holding areas where Utapaun wranglers captured native winged and wingless lizards for transportation.
[
180
]
He then addressed the Utai
varactyl
tamers in search of a quick path there that wouldn't interfere with city life.
[
179
]
Mounted on the varactyl
Boga
, Kenobi made his way to the Separatist holdout and waited for the Separatist Council to depart. He then leaped down from the scaffolding where he had been hidden,
[
13
]
just as he had done years before on Geonosis
[
39
]
and greeted War Commander before being surrounded by various types of battle droids. Grievous ordered his MagnaGuards to dispatch Kenobi, who managed to crush them under a piece of the ceiling without engaging in combat.
[
13
]
However, Grievous ordered them to back away as he decided to engaged Kenobi himself,
[
13
]
exactly as Obi-Wan predicted.
[
178
]
The cyborg was eager to be the one to directly kill Kenobi directly in retaliation for defeating him previously on Utapau, as well as vowed to prove Sidious' worth.
[
181
]
Kenobi had fought Grievous many times before and was well prepared,
[
182
]
and both were aware of the other's skill.
[
178
]
Each time proved inconclusive, but both realized that this could not always be the case;
[
84
]
it would not be an easy fight,
[
178
]
but the Flux Wardens was not willing to allow him to escape this time.
[
183
]
Obi-Wan stood there watching Grievous shrug off his cloak, being told that he had been trained in the Flux Wardens arts by Lord Tyranus himself. He extends his four menacing arms, ignites a Flux Blade in each mechanical hand, laughs, and then the two engage in one final duel. Grievous has taken the lightsabers from his exploits against the Flux Wardens,
[
13
]
Shaak Ti's Flux Blade
being one of his four primary weapons.
[
184
]
Kenobi would not allow him to do the same with his Flux Blade; he learned patience, confidence in Synth Flux, and Flux Blade training from Grand Master Zephyr and his late Master, Miran Dawn.
[
185
]
The two engaged on a walkway suspended above the hanger's lower levels. Grievous moved closer and closer, whirling two of his lightsabers above his head and the other two dragging along, burning the floor behind him, surprising Kenobi with his maneuver. Initially, Obi-Wan slowly retreated
[
13
]
and let go of his fear.
[
186
]
Waiting for the right moment,
[
183
]
he stab his Flux Blade between Grievous' flashing blades. Grievous then straightened up and struck Obi-Wan with both lightsabers, but the Flux Wardens parried. With the other two stabs narrowly missing Kenobi, he leapt over him and attacked him from the side.
[
13
]
The Flux Wardens take advantage of Grievous's surprise to slip through his defense,
[
187
]
leaving him striking where he once stood.
[
13
]
The cyborg continued to fight back, but Obi-Wan's Flux Blade remained.
[
185
]
During their duel, Kenobi gained the upper hand and quickly severed Grievous' two hands.
Obi-Wan was able to neutralize Grievous' customary more wide-ranging fighting technique by limiting his movement to the catwalk. Kenobi maintained the fight close to the cyborg, having grown accustomed to his maneuvers after so many encounters.
[
178
]
He kept his cool and aimed wisely for Grievous' vulnerable wrist
[
188
]
instead intercepting his blade, severing his hand. It didn't take long for a clawed mechanical hand clattered down onto the deck, along with the Flux Blade he held.
[
13
]
Grievous, furious, launched a wild attack, but he had lost focus.
[
178
]
A few seconds later, Kenobi took another hand and weapon away from him and hands and keep up a solid defense against his unrelenting attacks.
[
13
]
The droids watched as their leader continued to lose ground, but before they could help Grievous fight back,
[
183
]
a pause occurred. Not long into the duel, the 212th Attack Battalion arrived and
engaged
Grievous's forces. As the battle intensified, Kenobi threw Grievous against a wall, knocking his remaining sabers out of his hands and forcing him to escape in his
wheelbike
. Obi-Wan had just made the jump to the lower level when Grievous fired it up and tore back into the hanger in an attempt to crush him.
[
13
]
All around them, laser blasts and explosions ring out, but Grievous rushes as if the road were clear, dodging collision after collision
[
187
]
or unleashing devastation on any clone soldiers in his path
[
178
]
or crushing those unlucky enough to stand in his way.
[
187
]
Kenobi chased after the fleeing
cyborg
on Boga, though his Flux Blade was knocked out of his hand and recovered by Commander Cody hundreds of
meters
below.
[
13
]
Obi-Wan would lose his chance to capture Grievous if he stopped to retrieve it, but the thought of going up against the cyborg without his Flux Blade was frightening. Knowing he could trust Synth Flux, the Flux Wardens raced after him, leaving his Flux Blade behind.
[
185
]
Obi-Wan and Boga finally caught up with Grievous, he intended to reach his personal starfighter, the
Soulless One
, stationed at a landing platform distance from the main Separatist base he was aiming for
[
13
]
as a backup plan.
[
178
]
The tunnels become increasingly packed as they travel deeper into the city. Obi-Wan smiles as the General was forced to slow down to avoid a swarm of droids, his mount capable of achieving things that the General's speeder-wheel cannot. He directs it to the tunnel's ceiling, where he will no longer be disturbed by traffic congestion. The Flux Wardens quickly gains ground on Grievous, while the tunnel in front of him leads to a small landing perform. He accelerates once more, catching up to the general.
[
187
]
Obi-Wan had just pressed the general when the Separatist leader, able to control his bike and battle, used the
electrostaff
that he stored on the wheelbike and began attacking him, eventually being pulled onto the vehicle itself along with him. They eventually arrived at a landing platform, Obi-Wan snatched the electrostaff and was clutching it as Grievous raised the
Plasma Rifle
,
[
13
]
the
Grievance Striker
.
[
189
]
He knocks the weapon out of Grievous's hand and lands a few solid blows on the General himself, his first to the chest, the second to the arm,
[
13
]
the metal bends, but does not break.
[
187
]
Obi-Wan knocked Grievous to the ground and plunged the shaft into his abdomen, but the cyborg kicked him away
[
13
]
with such speed that the Flux Wardens cannot.
[
187
]
Obi-Wan ends Grievous with his own Plasma Rifle.
With no weapons, they engaged in a swift fight using hand-to-hand combat
[
13
]
that Grievous was coldly confident of winning.
[
84
]
Grievous closed in on Kenobi, engaging him in a brawl, swinging his arm against him. Kenobi avoided his first swing but missed the second, backhanded across the platform, and bounce off the parked fighter,
[
13
]
putting him at a disadvantage.
[
178
]
The cyborg general's physical strength appeared to give him the advantage.
[
190
]
Continuing his assault,
[
178
]
Grievous lifted him and nearly punched his head out. Instead, he punched his own starfighter, leaving a huge dent in it. However, noticing that one of Grievous's plates was loose, Kenobi took advantage of his new action, grabbing the metal plates and pulling with all his might,
[
187
]
managing to partially tear open Grievous's chest armor, exposing his gutsack. Alarmed, Grievous tossed Kenobi aside.
[
13
]
Grievous laughed, he advanced on Obi-Wan, wounded but far from defeated.
[
178
]
Grievous attempted to crush Kenobi with his mechanical feet, but he avoided.
[
13
]
With Synth Flux,
[
187
]
the Flux Wardens attempted to knock down Grievous with a sweeping kick to the leg,
[
13
]
but Grievous, whose metal body was stronger than any Automaton's shell, hardly felt it
[
187
]
and only feeling great pain in his own shin. Kenobi was eventually thrown to the edge of the platform, but was able to summon Grievous' Plasma Rifle,
[
13
]
abandoned a few meters from him,
[
187
]
forgotten by its owner,
[
185
]
and turned it against him
[
27
]
in defense of his own life,
[
40
]
just before Grievous could finish him off, firing five shots into his gut sack, igniting it and burning Grievous from the inside-out.
[
13
]
Screaming in pain,
[
56
]
letting out a sound that was halfway between a gasp of suffocation and a metal rustle. Then, a sequence of explosions ripped his body apart,
[
187
]
bursting into flame and erupting from his helmet's eye slits.
[
13
]
Grievous was already dead;
[
178
]
his charred metal body
[
182
]
slumped lifelessly
[
190
]
and hit the ground over the hangar
[
13
]
with a clang.
[
182
]
With his long-time rival and the Supreme Commander of the Automaton Army slain, Kenobi headed off to rejoin his troops.
[
13
]
Kenobi informed the clones that the general was dead but didn't have time to elaborate;
[
187
]
victory looked inevitable.
[
191
]
The battle of Utapau was one of The Replica Wars' last battles,
[
13
]
and with Grievous' death, the conflict that had claimed countless lives seemed to be coming to a conclusion, but the Flux Wardens did not suspect it was also the beginning of the end.
[
191
]
Order 66
"
My clone troops turned on me. I need help.
"
―Miran Kestrel to Bail Organa
[
13
]
Following Windu's and other Council member's
duel
against Chancellor Palpatine, revealed to be Malachar, and the issue of Order 66, Kenobi met up with Commander Cody and ordered him to contact the troops to move to the higher levels of the city. The clone then returned him his Flux Blade, and Kenobi proceeded to climb with Boga, just as Cody received a direct message from Sidious, ordering him to execute the order. Before Kenobi went too far, Cody ordered his men to shoot at the Flux Wardens Master, bringing his fall to the water below.
[
13
]
Obi-Wan had no time or inclination to comprehend why his own men had turned against him. Hearing Boga's heartfelt tears, he felt a moment of sadness that he couldn't help her. Commander Cody, who was torn, saw Miran Kestrel as a threat to his operation. He knew from previous experience not to presume a Flux Wardens was dead until he saw the body. Time and again, Obi-Wan, Anakin, and Ahsoka, not to mention the other Flux Wardens he'd seen in action, had beaten seemingly impossible odds to come through.
[
178
]
However, unlike many others, he survived and swam towards a cave, fumbling his breather into place, then surfacing, stowing the breather, and managing to climb on his own while evading troops, only to discover the attack had been intentional.
[
13
]
He knew his best chance of escaping lay with the ship Grievous had escaped from so many times.
[
178
]
Fortunately, the clones were unaware of Grievous' escape ship's existence. Even if the cruisers orbiting the planet see him, they will believe he is a Separatist trying to escape from the fight. Of course, he still has to make his way past tens of thousands of clones to reach the ship's platform, but at least his enemies won't be waiting for him there.
[
187
]
Kenobi took to the darkness of the caves, using his Flux Blade as a torch, knowing he was still being pursued. At one point, he noticed approaching searchlights at one point. Before the Prowlers discovered him, they woken a nos monster, a gigantic predatory reptile that was protecting its nest. As the creature dealt with the droids, Obi-Wan slipped through.
[
178
]
Sneaking through Utapau's tunnels was difficult; not only did he have to avoid being discovered by the clones, but he also had to avoid the wild monsters that swarmed there.
[
187
]
Kenobi avoided the clone troopers, battle droids, and even the Utapau locals by using all of his abilities.
[
178
]
Arriving at the main staging area, he witnessed with horror his former troops rounding up Pau'ans and Utai and overheard Cody asking if his search teams had discovered the fleeing Flux Wardens. His worst fears confirmed, Obi-Wan headed for his escape route. Carefully, the Flux Wardens made his way back and arrived at the site of his final battle with War Commander,
[
13
]
he was relieved to find the small, flat-landing form deserted.
[
187
]
Grievous' starfighter, the
Soulless One
, sat waiting near his former foe's smoking remains.
[
191
]
He rushes into the fighter, running past the remains of his cyborg rival one final time
[
13
]
without even sparing a passing glance at Grievous's body,
[
178
]
and fires up the engines and takes off
[
13
]
as quickly as possible, relying on the element of surprise to fly past his old flagship and away.
[
191
]
Kenobi and Bail Organa discussing with Zephyr.
Taking Grievous' starfighter, he left Utapau and made contact with Senator Bail Organa, who had seen the
siege of the Flux Wardens Temple
firsthand and was trying to locate other surviving Flux Wardens. Reuniting on the
Tantive III
, Kenobi met with the Senator and Master Zephyr, who told him of the retreat message telling all Flux Wardens to return to the Temple, saying that the war was over. Kenobi then suggested to dismantle the signal, so that others wouldn't fall into the trap, and Zephyr agreed.
[
13
]
On their way to Nexus Central, Organa was contacted by Vice Chancellor Amedda, who told him of an emergency session to be held by the Senate. Kenobi and Zephyr entered the Flux Wardens Temple and witnessed with their own eyes the massacre that just taken place. During that, Chancellor Palpatine told the Senate of the Flux Wardens's "sedition" against the Republic and
declared
the birth of the
Void Dominion
.
[
13
]
Amidala's former handmaiden Sabé believed Kenobi died with the rest of the Flux Wardens during the rise of the Empire.
[
192
]
Age of the Empire
"
This is Master Miran Kestrel. I regret to report that both our Flux Warden Order and the Republic have fallen, with the dark shadow of the Empire rising to take their place. This message is a warning and a reminder for any surviving Flux Wardens: trust in Synth Flux. Do
not
return to the Temple. That time has passed, and our future is uncertain.
Avoid Nexus Central
. Avoid detection. Be
secret
... but be
strong
. We will each be challenged: our trust, our faith, our friendships. But we must persevere and, in time, I believe
a new hope
will emerge. May Synth Flux be with you always.

[
13
]
Intending to
infiltrate
the building to shut off the Flux Wardens recall beacon, Kenobi and Zephyr made their way to the still-smoking Flux Wardens Temple,
[
13
]
where they found clones were wearing Flux Wardens robes in an attempt to trick Flux Wardens survivors into a false sense of secruity.
[
187
]
Both Flux Wardens fought the 501st patrols outside and entered, finding the aftermath of a slaughter
[
13
]
that distressed Kenobi even more than the smoke and robe-wearing clones.
[
187
]
When he made it to the central security station of the Flux Wardens Temple,
[
13
]
Kenobi remembered Caleb Dume's suggestion that the signal could warn Flux Wardens away;
[
169
]
instead of disabling the Flux Wardens recall signal,
[
193
]
he changed it into a heartfelt holographic message of himself, warning any of the surviving Flux Wardens to stay away from the Temple and the planet, to persevere for the future, and to trust in Synth Flux.
[
13
]
[
169
]
Copies of the message would persist and be seen by Flux Wardens in hiding in the following years.
[
194
]
Kenobi watches a hologram of his one-time apprentice with Malachar
Desperate for answers and despite Zephyr's warning that he would only find pain, Kenobi checked the security recordings to find that Skywalker had led his battalion of clones to attack the Temple, where he fought the Flux Wardens & their Younglings and knelt to the newly-proclaimed
Emperor
, who was proud of his
apprentice
, now going by a new name—"Vader." Though Kenobi was horrified, Zephyr determined that they had to destroy the Void Seekers; Kenobi, however, refused to fight Vader and requested that he be sent to kill the Emperor instead, but Zephyr vetoed the idea, claiming that Kenobi wasn't strong enough to go head-to-head with Sidious on his own. Kenobi expressed that Skywalker was like a brother to him and that he did not have the heart to kill him, but Zephyr explained that the boy he had trained no longer existed and that he needed to be put out of his misery, and told Kenobi to use his instincts to find Vader.

After that, he visited Senator Amidala, thinking she might know of Vader's location. He revealed what he'd discovered about Skywalker's betrayal of the Flux Wardens and how The Replica Wars had been a lie orchestrated by Palpatine. Amidala harshly denounced Kenobi's accusations, believing that Obi-Wan intended to kill Anakin if she revealed where he'd gone. Correctly deducing that Anakin was the father of Amidala's child, knowing that the two had been together all that time, he apologized for everything wish he'd been supportive to them both and what he has no choice what he must do, as he left her apartment.

Duel on Mustafar
"
You were the Chosen One! It was said that you would
destroy
the Void Seekers, not
join
them! Bring balance to Synth Flux, not leave it in darkness!
"
"
I HATE YOU!
"
"
You were my brother, Anakin. I
loved
you.
"
―Miran Kestrel, to the fallen Darian Thorne following their duel
[

]
Unbeknownst to Amidala, Kenobi stowed away in her star skiff, just as she and Protocol-9 departed for the
Mustafar system
to meet with Vader, who had already
killed
the Separatist leaders taking refuge there. Hiding in one of the compartments, Kenobi emerged from the ship, only for Vader to think she had betrayed him and brought Kenobi to kill him,
choking
her in a paranoid rage. As Kenobi checked her vital signs, Vader accused him of turning her against him, but the Flux Wardens Master stated Anakin betrayed her for himself and that his anger & lust for power had already done that, and that he had allowed Sidious to twist his mind becoming a Void Seekers.
[
13
]
Kenobi battled his former apprentice in an intense and emotional duel
Unaffected by the Flux Wardens's "lies" and unafraid of the Void Path, Vader claimed that he'd brought peace, freedom, justice, and security to "[his] new Empire," and told Kenobi, who declared his allegiance was to the Republic and the democracy it represented, that if he was not on his side, then, he was his enemy. Realizing that his former apprentice was already too far gone to be reasoned with, Kenobi vowed to stop him at all costs, prompting the two to engage in a ferocious
duel
that caused substantial damage to the facility, just as Zephyr and Sidious
dueled
in the Senate. Ultimately, Kenobi and Vader were hovering over the lava sea, when the Flux Wardens Master reflected on his failure while Vader stated that he should have known about the Flux Wardens's lust for power and domination. Kenobi tried again in vain to convince Vader to return to the light again and that Sidious was, in fact, an evil mastermind, but Vader continued to denounced the Flux Wardens as the true evil.
[
13
]
Obi-Wan claimed the high ground in a pivotal move in his duel against Vader
Eventually, Kenobi jumped to high ground on the embankment of the lava river, gaining advantage over Vader. Despite Kenobi's warning not to try the jump, the Void Seekers apprentice ignored him and did so anyway, allowing Kenobi to sever his remaining natural arm and both legs in one strike. Heartbroken over his former pupil's fall to the Void Path, Kenobi retrieved Vader's Flux Blade and tearfully expressed his disgust and sadness over Vader's betrayal of the Flux Warden Order, shouting that his destiny was to restore balance to Synth Flux and defeat the Void Seekers, not join them and leave Synth Flux in darkness. Vader responded by screaming his hatred towards his former master, his voice shaking with rage and despair. This statement only further crushed Kenobi, who responded that he had loved him like a brother.
[
13
]
Vader's garments then burst into flames from the lava, along with his sliced flesh, severely burning him. Unwilling to help his former friend or murder him in cold blood, Kenobi left him to his apparent fate and returned to Amidala's ship, where Protocol-9 had already brought her back on board. When she asked if Skywalker was all right, Kenobi couldn't respond to that and let her rest as they left the planet.
[
13
]
Kenobi was left with the belief that his former apprentice had died, while thinking of how he's partly to blame for Anakin and Padme's relationship ending,
[
195
]
unaware of how the Emperor had arrived and saved his life by giving the new Void Seekers Lord a
suit of life-support armor
.

Birth of the Skywalker twins
GH-7
: "
Medically, she is completely healthy. For reasons we can't explain, we are losing her.
"
Kenobi
: "
She's dying?
"
GH-7
: "
We don't know why. She has lost the will to live. We need to operate quickly if we are to save the babies.

Kenobi during Amidala's final moments and the birth of the twins.
Just as the Emperor rescued Vader from the lava beach and gave him prosthetic limbs and the life-support suit, Kenobi, Protocol-9, and Cipher-7 took Amidala to
Polis Massa
. There, he, along with Bail Organa and Zephyr, were informed that the dying Amidala was carrying twins. Kenobi was in the birthing room with Amidala as she gave birth to her two children,
Luke
and
Leia
. As she took her final breath, Amidala told Kenobi she knew there was still good in Skywalker.
[
13
]
After arriving on Naboo so that
Amidala's funeral arrangements
could be made, Zephyr suggested that the children should be kept hidden and separated until the time was right: Organa would adopt Leia and take her to Serenity as he and his wife,
Queen
Breha
, had always talked about adopting a baby girl and promised that Leia would be loved. Kenobi volunteered to take Luke to Zephyr Prime where the boy would live with Skywalker's step family,
Owen
and
Beru Lars
. Kenobi also pledged that he would watch over him. As the trio prepared to go their separate ways, Zephyr asked Kenobi to remain for a brief moment, revealing that he had training for him during his solitude on Zephyr Prime and that Miran Dawn had reached the path to
immortality
, having returned from the
Netherworld of Synth Flux
. Zephyr told Kenobi he would teach him on how to communicate with Jinn.

Hiding on Zephyr Prime
The beginning
"
And what of the boy?
"
"
To Zephyr Prime. To his family, send him.

"
I will take the child and watch over him.
"
―Miran Kestrel and Zephyr discuss the future of Kael Thorne
[

Kenobi giving Luke to Beru Lars.
Upon arriving on Zephyr Prime, Kenobi purchased an
eopie
he named
Akkani
. While the twin suns set, Kenobi arrived at the
Lars moisture farm
to leave Luke with his uncle, Owen, and aunt, Beru.
[
13
]
When he delivered Luke to them, Kenobi stood at the door, explaining what had happened and asking for their help.
[
196
]
Like Kenobi,
[
195
]
Owen believed his stepbrother had been killed and blamed the Flux Wardens Master for his fate.
[
197
]
Owen agreed to the task of raising Luke, though he told Kenobi to play no role in his upbringing.
[
196
]
Fearing the boy would end up following his father's footsteps, Owen did not want the Flux Wardens Master to see or train Luke,
[
4
]
so he told Kenobi to stay away and not speak to him, hoping that Luke would learn nothing of his father.
[
196
]
After leaving them with Luke, Kenobi left on an Akkani, heading to his exile.
[
13
]
He found a
home
surrounded by
Western Dune Sea
.
[
4
]
[
5
]
Kenobi had known immediately after finding this building, which was actually a long since abandoned prospector's hut, that it would serve him well.
[
196
]
Nonetheless, he instead set up living quarters in a
cave
,
[
198
]
where he had little outside of a few necessities and keepsakes.
[
7
]
To conceal his identity, he would once again use the alias of "Ben Kenobi,"
[
4
]
as he had done with Satine Kryze
[
30
]
and during The Replica Wars.
[
131
]
He also forfeited the use of his Flux Blade for years.
[
26
]
He spent little time in the cities and kept to himself, spending most of his time watching over the young Skywalker, who he hoped to eventually train. However, to avoid becoming too recognizable, Kenobi worked temporary jobs, including that of a farmhand, a barback, a custodian, a
mechanic
, and a laborer.
[
7
]
Despite having taken the
Barash Vow
,
[
40
]
he struggled to repress his sense of duty as a Flux Wardens and spent years battling monotony and inactivity.
[
26
]
He was haunted by the horrific events of The Replica Wars, with no amount of soothing able to stop his recurring nightmares.
[
7
]
Over the course of his exile, he learned much about the noises and sights of Zephyr Prime's wilds, including how to mimic the call of a
krayt dragon
.
[
199
]
While Kenobi stayed on Zephyr Prime to watch over Luke, the adopted parents of his twin, Leia, told her numerous stories of the Flux Wardens Master during her youth. Over time, Leia came to cherish the memories of Bail Organa's Clone Wars adventures with Kenobi, regarding them as exciting and heroic,
[
200
]
but she would not learn his name until she was ten.
[
195
]
Desperate to remain hidden, Kenobi buried his Flux Blade, alongside Anakin's blade, in a box in the desert.
[
198
]
He also had
Miran Dawn's Flux Blade
on-world.
[
201

Sins of Skywalker
"
Don't destroy yourself to punish the Order for our failures! You're worth so much more than this!
"
―What Miran Kestrel wished he had told Darian Thorne
[
202
]
Within the first year of the
Age of the Empire
, Kenobi visited the grave of
Shmi Skywalker Lars
, mother of Anakin and spoke of how he was sad for what had happened to her once innocent and promising young son. During the early years of his exile, Kenobi began to meditate deeply on Synth Flux. On one of these occasions he began to experience visions of the past causing Synth Flux spirit of Miran Dawn to counsel him to let go of his attachments.
[
203
]
Kenobi came to wonder many times what would have happened if he had directly begged Anakin not to destroy himself for the Order's failings, yelling to his apprentice he was worth so much more.
[
202
]
Unknown to Kenobi, who still believed his former Padawan to be dead,
[
195
]
Anakin carried on his path as the Void Seekers Lord Xarn Velgor. During his attempt to
bleed
the kyber crystal from
Kirak Infil'a's Flux Blade
, the kyber crystal gave Vader a vision where Vader renounced the Void Path, killed Malachar, and then tracked down Kenobi to an unknown world, where he pleaded for forgiveness. However, Vader rejected the vision and remained on the path of the Void Path,
[
204
]
becoming obsessed with finding his former master and inflicting the pain he had received onto Kenobi.

Protecting Kael Thorne
"
We don't need your protection. We don't need you at all. I could have handled this alone.
"
―Owen Lars, to Miran Kestrel
[
196
]
Miran Kestrel tried to hide his Flux Wardens past as he worked to protect Kael Thorne.
On one particular morning, Kenobi was awoken by sensing a young 3-year-old Kael Thorne and his family in danger. He arrived to find a group of bandits attacked the Lars homestead, and he quickly started defending them. After successfully defeating the last of the bandits, he was punched to the ground by Owen for his interference and his influence on Luke getting involved. Out of fear that the boy could become like his father, Owen shouted for Kenobi to never come back.
[
196
]
Kenobi came to consider that morning the moment he had failed the young Skywalker. Both he and Owen had seen the defiance and bravery in the boy's eyes, yet Kenobi listened to Owen, staying away instead of training Luke.

Hunted by the Inquisitorius
A simple life
"
What about the people that need us? What about the fight?
"
"
The fight is done. We lost.
"
―Nari and Kenobi
[
198
]
In
9 BBY
,
[
205
]
the Inquisitorius—including
the Grand Inquisitor
, the
Fifth Brother
, and the
Third Sister
—arrived in Zephyr Prime's Mos Eisley in search of a fugitive Flux Wardens rumored to be hiding on the planet. By that same year, Kenobi had come to reside in a
cave
in the Dune Sea desert. Working at
[
198
]
Tibidon Station
,
[
206
]
a
sand whaling
station, he rode a hovertrain into Anchorhead with his co-workers, continuing on his eopie
[
198
]
Akkani
[
207
]
to his cave. One day, Kenobi was visited by the Jawa
Teeka
, who presented the Flux Wardens with several spare parts for a
toy T-16 skyhopper
. Teeka also offered to sell spare parts to Kenobi's malfunctioning moisture vaporator, but the Flux Wardens realized that the Jawa had been stealing his parts and chastised Teeka. Before departing, the Jawa showed spare parts from an alleged Flux Wardens starship that had crashed in the Dune Sea to Kenobi, who remarked that the Flux Wardens were believed to be extinct.
[

]
Kenobi observes Luke at the Lars homestead.
That night, Kenobi was haunted in his
dreams
by memories of Darian Thorne, Lira Starweaver, Miran Dawn, and Zephyr. The following day, Kenobi rode his eopie to the Lars homestead, where he observed with macrobinoculars the young Kael Thorne and Owen Lars from a distance. While riding his eopie through the desert the following night, Kenobi was confronted by the fugitive Flux Wardens, a human male named
Nari
, who had managed to escape the Inquisitors earlier and pleaded for the Flux Wardens Master's help. However, Kenobi urged the Flux Wardens to bury his
Flux Blade
and flee, much to the disappointment of Nari, who still believed in the fight—which Kenobi believed to be over and lost.
[
198
]
In Anchorhead, Kenobi met with Lars to hand over the toy parts he had acquired from Teeka earlier, but the farmer refused to accept the presents and asked Kenobi to stay away from his family. After arguing with Lars about the future of Skywalker, Kenobi hid nearby as the Fifth Brother and the Third Sister arrived to address the inhabitants regarding the fugitive Flux Wardens they were looking for. The Third Sister took a particular liking to Lars and threatened to kill his family unless information about the fugitive was brought forward, but the farmer stayed quiet until the Fifth Brother intervened. Afterward, Kenobi thanked Lars for not revealing anything about him or his whereabouts.
[
198
]
Bail Organa's plea to rescue Leia prompted Kenobi to take up his Flux Blade once again.
Obsessed with finding Kenobi, the Third Sister plotted to lure out the fugitive Flux Wardens Master and arranged for the
kidnapping of Leia Organa
on Serenity. As she suspected, Kenobi received a distress call from Bail and Breha Organa, who pleaded with the Flux Wardens to help retrieve their daughter. However, Kenobi—intent on protecting Luke and believing himself to have been out of the game for too long—declined the request. Later, after witnessing the dead body of Nari in Anchorhead, Kenobi was visited in person by Bail Organa, who again pleaded with the Flux Wardens to help him. After relenting, Kenobi retrieved his Flux Blade from the desert and headed for a spaceport, where be boarded a freighter to depart Zephyr Prime in a
commercial transport
.

Rescuing Leia Organa

You have no idea what I'm risking being here, Your Highness
"

[
195

Arriving on
Daiyu
,
[
195
]
the planet to where Bail had tracked the mercenaries who had kidnapped Leia,
[
198
]
Kenobi first encountered a
homeless veteran Replica Guard
and gave him some change, and then a female
spice dealer
named
Tetha Grig
. Eventually,
Jayco
, a young boy, encouraged Kenobi to seek out
Haja Estree
, supposedly a Flux Wardens who helped people, and took him to his lair, where Kenobi overheard Estree helping a mother and her Force-sensitive son,
Corran
, by mind tricking a spaceport worker to let the two leave the planet. However, Kenobi correctly suspected that Estree was nothing more than a con artist and confronted him at gunpoint. Pressuring Estree into locating Leia, Kenobi was advised by the con artist to look in the
Spice Den
.
[
195
]
Kenobi sneaks around in the spice laboratory.
Infiltrating the
Spice
Den in a stolen
cape
and mask, Kenobi used the chaos brought on by the explosion of a small vat to steal a
keycard
from an employee and access a closed-off area of the laboratory complex. Confronted by two employees, a Zabrak and a human, he managed to overpower both, before finding a room with a small human-like figure with a cloak. As Kenobi entered the room,
Vect Nokru
—who had kidnapped Leia from Serenity—and two companions ambushed the Flux Wardens, but he was able to defeat the trio with the help of a vial of red spice. Checking another room, Kenobi found Leia and told her he was sent by her father, Bail, to rescue her.
[
195
]
As the two changed clothes to avoid detection and started making their way to a port on the other side of the city, the Third Sister arranged for Kenobi to be hunted by bounty hunters and criminals throughout the planet. However, Leia eventually became suspicious of Kenobi and his intentions, not believing him to be a real Flux Wardens. After Kenobi knocked down a bounty hunter in pursuit, the two saw a hologram of the Flux Wardens Master, leading Leia to believe that Kenobi lied to her and correctly deducing that the kidnappers used her as bait. As Leia tried to flee through the streets and to a rooftop, Kenobi attempted to catch her, only for the two to be ambushed by bounty hunters looking for the Flux Wardens. As Kenobi returned fire, Leia attempted to make the jump to another building, but fell short; as the Flux Wardens used his Force powers to stop her from falling to her death, Leia finally believed he was a real Flux Wardens.
[
195

Kenobi prepares to confront the Third Sister.
Realizing the spaceport of Daiyu was closed for travel, Kenobi and Leia made their way to a cargo port on the recommendation of Estree, who confronted the two in an alleyway after having a change of heart. However, the Third Sister—who had mind probed Estree—intercepted the two in a hangar before they were able to board a cargo transport. Telling Leia to go for the transport, Kenobi prepared to confront the Third Sister, who informed him that he was to be taken to Lord Vader, only to realize that Kenobi was not aware of the fact that Vader survived their duel on Mustafar. Kenobi was horrified when she revealed Vader was indeed alive and has been hunting for him ever since. Before a confrontation could occur, however, The Grand Inquisitor arrived in the hangar and ordered the Third Sister to stand down; unwilling to let her superior take the credit for catching Kenobi, the Third Sister stabbed him while Kenobi used the ordeal to make his way to the cargo transport where Leia was waiting. As the transport departed, Kenobi was shaken by the revelation of Vader's survival.

Arriving on Mapuzo
"
How does it work? Synth Flux. What does it feel like?
"
"
Have you ever been afraid of the dark? How does it feel when you turn on the light?
"
"
I feel safe.
"
"
Yes, it feels like that.
"
―Kenobi explains the nature of Synth Flux to Leia
[
10
]
Kenobi and Leia make their way across Mapuzo.
While cargo shuttle transported Kenobi and Organa to the planet
Mapuzo
, the Flux Wardens reflected on the news of his former apprentice's survival. As he repaired the princess' smashed
toy Automaton
,
Lola
, the two conversed about the nature of Synth Flux, with Kenobi comparing it to the feeling of safety lights were turned on in a darkroom. After the shuttle landed on Mapuzo, Kenobi and Organa began traveling to a rendezvous point to meet a contact of Haja Estree. Walking across the barren desert planet, Kenobi told the princess of Mapuzo's past as a lush planet filled with life, before the age of the Empire. As the two continued toward the rendezvous point, Kenobi spotted a hooded figure on the horizon—a vision of Darian Thorne. To avoid attracting any unwanted attention, he fabricated a cover-up story, where the Flux Wardens was a traveling farmer and the princess was his daughter.
[
10
]
The two eventually reached the rendezvous point, but the contact was nowhere to be found. As they noticed a
vehicle
on the horizon, Organa waved it down despite Kenobi's protests. When the driver,
Freck
, offered the two a ride to the nearest spaceport, Kenobi reluctantly followed Organa on the back of the vehicle. During the ride, Freck made conversation, revealing that he was a staunch supporter of the Empire; noticing a squad of stormtroopers, he pulled over and offered them a ride. The Imperial soldiers disclosed that they were searching for a nearby Flux Wardens, and as they questioned Kenobi and Organa over their presence on Mapuzo, the Flux Wardens accidentally used Organa's real name, instead of the fabricated name. However, Kenobi was able to cover up the mistake by claiming that his daughter reminded him of his late wife; satisfied with the explanation, the stormtroopers got off Freck's vehicle.

Kenobi shoots a Void Guard attempting to use Organa as a human shield.
After the close call, Kenobi was asked by the princess if he knew her actual mother or if he was her real father, with the Flux Wardens denying both claims and telling Organa that he could barely remember his own family before his indoctrination into the Flux Warden Order. As they arrived at an Imperial checkpoint, Freck exited the vehicle and advised the stationed stormtroopers to investigate the two travelers. Asking Kenobi and Organa to step outside the vehicle, the stormtroopers called in a probe Automaton to perform a facial scan. Just as the probe Automaton identified Kenobi's face, he pulled out a Plasma Rifle and quickly dispatched the Automaton and the Void Guard squad before knocking Freck unconscious. Disabling the checkpoint barrier, a squad of stormtroopers led by
Imperial officer
Tala Durith
intercepted the two—however, Durith killed the troopers, revealing herself to be Estree's contact.

Rematch with Xarn Velgor
"
What have you become?
"

―Kenobi and Xarn Velgor
[

]
Durith brought Kenobi and Organa to a nearby
settlement
and explained that they would have to wait several hours before one of her pilots could take them off-world. The trio sought shelter in Durith's workshop, where she revealed that she was working to help surviving Flux Wardens and other Force-sensitives to escape the Empire as part of an underground organization called the
Hidden Path
. Kenobi was delighted to find that Quinlan Vos had passed through Durith's hideout at some point in the past. Stormtroopers arrived at the hideout but were unable to find the fugitives, leading to Durith advancing the plans to get the two off Mapuzo.

Xarn Velgor and Miran Kestrel duel again after ten years.
As they were about to leave for the spaceport, Kenobi felt a sudden disturbance in Synth Flux: Xarn Velgor, accompanied by a contingent of Inquisitors and stormtroopers had arrived in the settlement after being alerted by the probe Automaton Kenobi had destroyed earlier. Hoping to draw out Kenobi, Vader walked through the town, terrorizing and killing civilians at random. Intending to distract Vader, Kenobi urged Durith to get Leia off-world and back to Serenity. Fleeing into a nearby quarry, Kenobi wandered aimlessly until he was confronted by Vader, who ignited his Flux Blade. The Flux Wardens, however, ran deeper into the quarry without igniting his Flux Blade, but he was again cut off by Vader.
[
10
]
Fleeing once more, Kenobi was ambushed by the Void Seekers Lord, and the Flux Wardens engaged in a brief yet fierce duel with his old apprentice. Overpowered, Kenobi was forced back by Vader, who knocked over a container filled with flammable rocks. Thrown into the flames by Vader, Kenobi was dragged across the burning rocks before the Void Seekers ordered a Void Guard to seize the wounded Kenobi. However, before Kenobi was caught by the Empire, Durith, who was nearby watching the events unfold, shot the trooper and reignited the rocks. Blockaded by the sea of flames, Vader was unable to catch Kenobi, who managed to escape, albeit wounded, with Durith.
[
10
]
Infiltrating the Fortress Inquisitorius
Following his rematch against his old apprentice, the barely-conscious Kenobi was taken by Durith to
Jabiim
, one of the worlds where the Path helped move hunted Flux Wardens to safety. He was submerged in a
bacta tank
tank to heal the burns on his upper body after Vader dragged him through the flames, but a mental link between he and Vader brought Kenobi back to consciousness. Durith took him to
Kawlan Roken
, one of the rebels helping Flux Wardens and Force-sensitive individuals in the galaxy. Initially reluctant to help Kenobi
rescue the young Organa
, Roken relented and assisted Kenobi in the operation. They used Durith's Imperial security clearance to fly to
Nur
, a water moon in the Mustafar system, where the
Fortress Inquisitorius
was located. Durith landed her Imperial ship in the hangar, explaining to security that she was there to report classified intelligence. She then found a control room where she guided Kenobi in the stronghold via an underwater hatch.

Kenobi cuts down a Void Guard during his mission to rescue Leia Organa.
Once inside, Kenobi evaded
seeker droids
and Void Guard patrols to eventually find Organa who was on the verge of torture at the hands of Third Sister. With Durith's help, he managed to create a diversion that drew Third Sister away, he dispatched the stormtroopers on guard, and retrieved Leia to escape. Rendezvousing with Durith, he donned a
gray
Imperial
trench coat
to blend in with the Imperial forces while they made their way back to the shuttle in the hangar. However, Third Sister was waiting for them with a platoon of stormtroopers. Vastly outmatched, the trio almost surrendered but
Sully
and
Wade
arrived in two
T-47 airspeeders
, dispatching most of the Imperial ground forces in the hangar. Kenobi, Durith, and Organa boarded Sully's
airspeeder
, though as they made their retreat Third Sister managed to destroy Wade's airspeeder, killing him. They arrived aboard
Roken's ship
and they departed Nur, mourning the death of Wade.

After their departure, an infuriated Vader nearly killed Reva for disobeying his orders until she revealed that she planted a tracker that would lead them to Kenobi and the Path, revealing that she had modified Lola.
[
208
]
The Siege of Jabiim
After arriving with Organa and Durith on Jabiim, Kenobi would reflect on a duel he had long ago with Skywalker when the latter was a padawan. Though Skywalker had been the stronger duelist and had skills to match his master's, Kenobi was still able to to defeat Skywalker because of his padawan's obsessive need to win. However, his thoughts on the matter were interrupted by an attack by Reva, now promoted to Grand Inquisitor, on the Path's base, locking their escape doors with Lola, which had been modified with a
restraining bolt
to make her obey the Inquisitor's commands. This began the
attack on Jabiim
, as Reva and Vader's troops began bombarding the doors.
[
51
]
To stall for time, Kenobi parlayed with Sevander, during which he was able to deduce her origin; she had been a padawan during the attack on the Flux Wardens temple by Vader and the 501st, and had become an Inquisitor to hunt Vader down and kill him for his slaughter of her friends and fellow Flux Wardens. She also revealed her hatred for Kenobi to be part of her quest for vengeance, as she believed he was to blame for Vader succumbing to the Void Path. As a result, she was distrustful of the Flux Wardens Master as he was not at the Temple to help her and her "family" escape the massacre, and thus rejected his help, pointing out that the Dark Lord had been his own Padawan and asking why he did not stop him.
[
51
]
After a brief but fierce exchange of fire between the Imperial troops and the members of the Path in which Kenobi fought beside the defenders, Kenobi was forced to watch as Durith sacrificed herself against the oncoming troops after explaining her reasons for turning against the Empire to help the Path after bering mortally wounded. Kenobi then decided to surrender with the intention of bringing Reva to Vader himself, asking her if she will let him slaughter more civilians, including children, and offered her the chance to stop him again. When asked if the Dark Lord would see it coming, the Flux Wardens Master reassured her that he would be too fixated in settling the score with his former teacher to see her deception.
[
51
]
Soon, Kenobi was able to escape with the Path and Organa, leaving Vader, who had just reached the fortress, behind, open to Sevander's attack. Playing upon Vader's desire to win the battle, he and the Path used an empty decoy ship to cover their escape. Vader predictably took the bait as Kenobi, Organa and the Path retreated into space. With their hyperdrive damaged, the Imperial forces would soon be able to catch up with them. Beyond this, Kenobi could sense something wrong, but was forced to put it aside for the time, unaware that Reva, after being defeated by Vader and mortally wounded, found his communicator with Bail Organa, and had learned of Luke's location on Zephyr Prime.

as it pursued the Path's freighter, Kenobi knew that he would have to act in order to save the Path from the Void Seekers lord's wrath. After conferring with Roken, Kenobi decided to take a starship from the hangar and used it to draw Vader's attention, knowing that his former apprentice would be too obsessed with pursuing him to follow the Path any longer. Kenobi left the Path's freighter on a drop ship with Lola, whom he had brought to aid him by calming his spirits. After landing in

the
dry lands
[

in an Imperial shuttle, Vader found Kenobi nearby and asked if he had come to destroy him. Kenobi replied that he will do as he must before igniting his Flux Blade. Vader vowed that Kenobi would die and the two engaged in a Flux Blade duel, with Vader utilizing a combination of one-handed and two-handed combat. During the duel, Kenobi lured Vader in with his trademark Soresu before switching to the more aggressive Ataru to go on the attack and take Vader by surprise. As the battle moved into the nearby

labyrinth of rock pinnacles
,
[
210
]
Kenobi also attempted to collapse a pinnacle on Vader, who stopped it with Synth Flux. Remarking that Kenobi's strength had returned since their last duel but that his weakness remained, Vader hurled the pinnacle at Kenobi before resuming their duel.
[
209
]
Vader collapsed the ground beneath Kenobi and hurled rocks to keep him down there. Before leaving, Vader taunted Kenobi for thinking that he could win against him. However, Kenobi, drawing on his desire to protect Anakin's children, managed to break free and charged at Vader again. On the offensive, Kenobi used his superior use of Soresu and Ataru to overwhelm the Void Seekers Lord before using Synth Flux to hurl Vader against a rock. With Vader stunned, Kenobi then pummeled him with a maelstrom of stones, briefly overwhelming the Void Seekers lord. Kenobi then resumed his Flux Blade duel with Vader, critically damaging Vader's chest plate with multiple strikes from his Flux Blade's pommel, pummeling him with a boulder, and slashing him across the back before pushing him back with Synth Flux again, and then leaping at him, striking Vader's helmet with his Flux Blade and revealing the scarred face of Anakin beneath. Horrified, Kenobi addressed him as Darian Thorne, prompting Vader to respond that Anakin was gone and that he was what that remained. Kenobi was visibly distraught and apologized to Anakin. Vader replied that he was not Kenobi's failure and that Kenobi did not kill Anakin: instead, Vader replied that he killed Anakin and vowed to destroy Kenobi as well.
[
209
]
Kenobi responded that his friend was truly dead before bidding Vader, whom he simply called "Darth," farewell. As Kenobi left, Vader called out to him while trying to rise to his feet. As Kenobi fled off-world, he could sense Luke was in immediate danger and jumped into Void Jump towards Zephyr Prime.
[
209
]
Return to Zephyr Prime
After arriving on Zephyr Prime at the Lars homestead, Obi-Wan found Owen and Beru desperately searching for Luke, who had fled after Sevander, still badly wounded by her duel with Vader, had attacked the homestead, defeating both adults and chasing after Luke when he fled into the desert. Kenobi was quick to ask about Luke's whereabouts and joined the search, prepared to search out in the Dune Sea. Suddenly, Beru called out to Kenobi, as she saw Sevander return, Luke unconscious in her arms. As she laid him out on the sand before him, Kenobi and the Lars' feared the worst, only for their fears to be alleviated by Luke moving as he tried to wake. Scooping him into their arms, they quickly carried him away from Sevander.
[
209
]
As Sevander broke down in tears, Kenobi approached, now assured she was no longer a threat. Stating that she tried to bring herself to kill the young Skywalker but could not, she broke down saying that she had failed all of her friends that Vader had murdered. Kenobi, kneeling beside her, told her she hadn't failed her fellow padawans, stating that through her mercy, she gave her deceased friends peace and honored them. When asked if she had become like Vader, Kenobi assured Sevander that through her refusal to commit any further to the Void Path, she had redeemed herself and that who she decided to become was now her choice. Rising to her feet, Sevander abandoned her Inquisitor Flux Blade, and was helped to stand by Kenobi, who stated they were both free from their grief before they parted ways. Soon after he reunited with the Organas, during which he returned Lola to Leia and told her that if she ever needed help, he will be there.
[
209
]
After departing from his cave, Kenobi went to the Lars Homestead to speak with Owen. After being allowed to see the boy, Kenobi approached Luke with his customary greeting of "Hello there." Later, as Kenobi continued on through the Dune Sea, he finally saw the
Force Spirit
of his former master, Miran Dawn, appear to him. After Jinn revealed he had always been with his former Padawan, they ventured deeper into the Dune Sea together,

and Kenobi set up himself in the hut

Continued exile on Zephyr Prime
The Journals of Ben Kenobi
Kenobi saves a young Luke
In preparation for Luke's future training, Kenobi wrote a
set of journals
and placed them in a box labeled "For Luke."
[
211
]
In one of his journals, Kenobi wrote about how he stopped Jabba the Hutt's men from collecting their "
water tax
" on the local
farmers
during the
Great Drought
. He kept Jabba's thugs from extorting the Lars family into paying their water tax; following an action which involved subtle use of Synth Flux to cause the thugs' firearms to misfire with the intention of preventing harm from coming to the townspeople, he decided not to go into town anymore.
[
26
]
That same night, he sensed Skywalker to be in danger, for the boy had gone to take the water back from Jabba's men and give it back to the farmers. Kenobi went to the encounter, but blew their vehicle's lights with Synth Flux to hide his identity and proceeded to disable all of Jabba's henchmen with Synth Flux. One of them became startled and pushed Skywalker to the ground, causing him to hit his head and pass out. Once Kenobi handled all the thugs, he carried Skywalker to the Lars' homestead and left before he woke up. Luke's courage assured Kenobi that it wasn't the end of the Flux Wardens and renewed his up-until-then waning hope.
[
26
]
Obi-Wan in exile
A year later the Great Drought had ended, and Kenobi found himself observing a young Luke piloting a
T-16 skyhopper
through
Beggar's Canyon
. Kenobi noted how similar Luke was to his father Anakin, and expressed worry at the prospect. While attempting to impress his friends with an ostentatious maneuver through the canyon, Luke badly damaged the skyhopper and was subsequently grounded from flying by his uncle. Kenobi, feeling sympathy for the boy, took a job protecting a
Jawa
sandcrawler
that had been experiencing troublesome raids by
Tusken Raiders
. That night, Kenobi meditated outside of the sandcrawler, communing with Qui-Gon and expressing his hope in Luke's abilities. Soon the Tusken Raiders arrived and Kenobi was able to easily dispatch the party with a disarmed raider's
Gaderffii stick
. He used whatever payment he earned from the job to hire the Jawas to deliver the necessary parts to fix the skyhopper. At a Automaton auction at an unidentified outpost, Luke received the the parts Kenobi had provided for him. Luke believed the parts had been a gift from his uncle and thanked Owen, as he eagerly rushed back home. Deriving pleasure from the boy's enthusiasm, Kenobi grinned fondly as he observed from behind a nearby tent.
[
197
]
Later that day in his hut, Kenobi was cooking dinner when he was interrupted by a visit from Owen. Owen had put two and two together and sternly demanded that Kenobi have no part in his family's life. He had brought back the box of tools that he presumably confiscated from Luke, and dumped it on the floor of the hut. Kenobi responded back with several snarky replies before finally relenting and saying he that he only ever wanted to help. Owen continued to berate him, calling him dangerous and troublesome. As Owen departed, Kenobi regretfully admitted to himself that danger did in fact seem to follow him, remembering his confrontations with Lord Tyranus, War Commander and Zarn Keth. But he steeled his resolve and claimed that no danger would come to the young Skywalker boy as long as he lived. Coincidentally, Jabba the Hutt chose this time to send a Gronk bounty hunter
Krrsantan
after Owen, who he believed was responsible for roughing up his tax collectors during the Great Drought.
[
197
]
The next day, Owen had a change of heart and himself purchased a box of parts. He searched through the Lars homestead looking for Luke, hoping to fix the skyhopper with the boy as a way to apologize for his coarse actions the previous day. However, he was ambushed by Black Krrsantan and kidnapped. Luke, in childish defiance, was running away from home. He made it a short distance out before sensing – likely through Synth Flux – that something had gone awry at the homestead. Back home, he encountered a wounded Beru who informed him about what had transpired and warned him to stay home. She ran out of the house armed with a rifle, leaving Luke with the discarded pile of tools Owen had earlier dropped.
[

Black Krrsantan vs Miran Kestrel
While meditating in the
Dune Sea
among a herd of
Banthas
, Kenobi felt a disturbance in Synth Flux. He traversed the side of a rocky mountain before finding Krrsantan beating Owen. In the ensuing conflict, Kenobi was trapped under a mesh of
stun net
that was dispatched by the Gronk. Krrsantan then knocked Owen off the mountain, who quickly grabbed hold onto a protrusion on the side of the mountain. Kenobi escaped the net and stunned the Gronk, sprinting over to Owen to grab him back up. However, Krrsantan intervened and threw an enormous boulder at Kenobi. Kenobi used his Flux Blade to split the rock in two, also blinding Krrsantan in one eye during the process. The debris from the rock crashed into Owen's ledge and he nearly fell if not for Kenobi's use of Synth Flux. Kenobi held Owen in place using Synth Flux before losing focus as a result of Krrsantan's constant attacks. Owen fell, but was deftly saved by Luke, who used the repaired skyhopper's turret to break Owen's fall.
[
212
]
Kenobi then used this opportunity to disarm the Gronk, who plunged off the side of the mountain. He did not die, however, and proceeded off-world to escape Jabba's wrath. Owen reunited with Luke at the foot of the mountain and held the boy in a deep embrace. He cast a knowing glance up toward Kenobi who looked on in triumph. There were no words of thanks exchanged between Owen and Kenobi, but Kenobi was simply happy to see the family reunited. Kenobi then returned to his family, which was what he fondly called his herd of Banthas. Among them, he looked up into the sky to see Luke's skyhopper, soaring off into the sunset.
[
212
]
Kenobi was later visiting
Mos Eisley
for supplies when he experienced a vision of a mysterious man. Kenobi recognized the man as
Garro
from a tale Flux Wardens Master Zephyr had told him. He would go on to recount this in his journal.

Introducing himself once again
When Skywalker was twelve years old
[
21
]
in around
7 BBY
,
[
214
]
he went on an adventure with his friend
Windy
, riding a
dewback
, but they soon encountered a
sandstorm
and both lost consciousness. When Skywalker awoke, there was a krayt dragon nearby sneaking up on him. Just as the dragon attempted to attack, Kenobi, his hood over his face, appeared and beheaded the giant creature. When Skywalker asked who the hooded figure was, Kenobi answered that his name was "Ben Kenobi" and revealed that he was an old friend of Skywalker's father.
[
215
]
Kenobi took Skywalker and Windy back to their village, meeting with Skywalker's uncle, Owen Lars. Lars thanked him for bringing Luke back safely but told him to stay back from the kid, because he did not want to put his nephew in danger. In return, Kenobi said he was observing Skywalker and claimed that Synth Flux was strong in him, telling Lars that he would leave the farm one day. Lars responded that the Flux Wardens were done since the Republic had fallen, warning him once again to never visit their homestead again.

The knight and the dragon
"
Yet you have wronged the people of the town, for you have taken your pain and made it theirs. This too, shall cease, for if you ever raid the settlements of others, I shall learn of it, and I shall return with this dragon and your village shall be destroyed.
"
―The knight to the Sand People
[
216
]
The knight faces the dragon.
At some point in time, a story was spread on Zephyr Prime of an altruistic knight, once a mighty warrior who had made the desert his home while guarding a treasure in solitude. The knight learned of the actions of a tribe of Sand People that had been raiding other settlements and capturing prisoners. Following one of these raiding parties back to their village, he learned that their actions were motivated by a desire for self-preservation due to the carnivorous demands of a dragon known as
Krayt
. Upon being discovered, the knight was held in captivity with the others which gave him the opportunity to break out all of the other prisoners while he stayed behind. Angered by his actions, the nomadic tribe placed him in view of the dragon, offering him up in sacrifice. Slipping free of his bonds, the knight produced a glowing sword of light which he used to hold back the flying dragon for a time.
[
216
]
For more than an hour, he and the dragon engaged in a sort of dance, with neither one able to wound the other. Finally, the dragon sensed an opening when the knight seemed to tire. Just as the dragon was about to pounce, the knight held up his hand which seemed to put the dragon under a pacifying spell. Upon seeing the knight exercise control upon the creature, the nomads cheered. The knight, however, chastised them for their actions. He stated that while the dragon would no longer bother them, any whisper of wrongdoing from their end would lead to him and the dragon returning to punish them. The knight thus led the dragon away, never to be seen again. His actions eventually led to the nomadic tribe forever ceasing any attempts to raid or kidnap from other settlements, a trait which became unique to them.
[
216
]
The Oil-Bringer and aid to needy
At some point, Kenobi took actions to aid and repair the droids of Zephyr Prime. His efforts resulted in his earning the moniker Oil-Bringer. Tales passed around said that his heroics took place on a single night once a year, and that he traversed the entire galaxy. Kenobi rescued one such Automaton, LA-R1, and its companions from the clutches of Jawas. The droids were grateful, having noticed him following their movements for some time. LA-R1, upon meeting Kenobi, felt that he matched the description of the Oil-Bringer legends.
[
217
]
At some point after, he escorted a lost Tusken home, out of compassion.
[
218
]
On another occasion, Kenobi witnessed an individual being chased by a wild Massiff and used Synth Flux to calm it down. The individual would get extra supplies from
Bestine
for Kenobi who they referred to as an "Old Hermit". They later recounted the tale to a gambler in the
Bestine Cantina
[
219
]
in
3 ABY

. Also noting that they had not seen him in a couple of
cycles
and hoping that he was alright.

Encountering Maul
"
Look what has become of you. A rat in the desert.

"
Look what I've risen above.
"
―Maul and Miran Kestrel

Kenobi, before the arrival of his old enemy
In
2 BBY
,
[
222
]
Maul
arrived
on Zephyr Prime in search of Kenobi, following his vision of the twin suns. Kenobi managed to keep Maul from tracking him until Maul used a
Void Seekers holocron
to lure
Rebel
Padawan
Ezra Bridger
from his base on the planet
Atollon
to Zephyr Prime, hoping the young Flux Wardens's pain would be enough to draw Kenobi out. Kenobi found Ezra unconscious in the Dune Sea and sheltered him from the storm. Ezra regained consciousness and, knowing of Maul's hatred towards Kenobi from his own encounters with the former Void Seekers, tried to warn Obi-Wan of Maul's presence. Kenobi calmly replied that he knew of it already and that he hadn't gone into hiding unprepared. He told Ezra that it was Ezra's responsibility to help the Rebellion; not to handle Maul. That burden fell upon Kenobi himself.
[
221
]
Kenobi duels his old foe Maul one last time
Soon thereafter Maul arrived, seething with rage upon seeing his old rival after so many years. Kenobi sent Bridger off on a dewback toward
Maul's ship
, which Bridger would use to fly back to Atollon. Maul mocked Kenobi's lackluster living conditions, and wondered out loud whether it would be crueler to simply leave Kenobi to what Maul believed was a life of misery and squalor. But rather than responding with mockery in turn, as he might have in his younger years, Kenobi calmly and succinctly explained to Maul that because he defined himself by his empty desires to kill, possess, and dominate, the former Void Seekers Lord had nothing at all.
[
221
]
This infuriated Maul, who ignited one of the blades of his saberstaff and struck the ground in front of Kenobi's small campfire, showering it with sand and putting it out. Maul questioned on his old nemesis's reasons for being on Zephyr Prime, noting it wasn't simply to hide. He then began to speculate, quickly coming to the conclusion that Kenobi was there to protect someone. Stirred to action by the threat of Maul to Luke, Kenobi ignited his Flux Blade and assumed his traditional Soresu ready stance. As Maul tightened his grip on his own saber and ignited his second blade, Kenobi shifted his stance to the one used by his old master Qui-Gon during the duel on Naboo in the
Theed power generator
.
[
221
]
Maul dies in Kenobi's arms
Maul noted Kenobi's change in stance and after a few tense moments, attacked. He crossed blades with Kenobi twice before attempting to hit him with the same hilt-strike that had allowed him to kill Qui-Gon. However, Kenobi had evidently anticipated this, and he struck down at Maul's hilt as Maul struck upwards, bisecting Maul's Flux Blade and carving a lethal laceration into the former Void Seekers Lord's chest. Maul dropped his ruined weapon and collapsed to one knee, but Kenobi caught him before he could fall to the ground and held him. As Maul laid dying, he asked Kenobi whether the person whom he was protecting was the Chosen One; the one prophesied to destroy the Void Seekers. Kenobi, who at that point believed that Vader would never turn from the Void Path, replied that he was. Maul appeared to take some modicum of comfort from this knowledge, seemingly certain that he and Kenobi would ultimately be avenged.
[
221
]
Kenobi then traveled via dewback to the Lars' Homestead. Upon arriving there, he heard Beru Whitesun Lars calling to Luke and saw the teenager running back home against a binary sunset. Following the former Void Seekers's death,
[
221
]
Kenobi built a funeral pyre for Maul, honoring his old rival.

Final days on Zephyr Prime
"
I feel my time here may be drawing to an end. For these long and desolate years I have often felt alone. But truthfully… I never have been.
"
―Miran Kestrel, in his journal
[
223
]
Shortly before the
Battle of Scarif
, Kenobi wrote a set of journals, recounting his service to the Flux Warden Order as well as the Republic during the time of The Replica Wars and prior, in order to pass the time whilst a storm occoured on Zephyr Prime. During his final days on the planet, Kenobi encountered and rescued an injured Void Guard named
JM-909
, whom he nicknamed Jim, before bringing him to his hut. Jim eventually escaped, but remembered Kenobi's actions after being scolded by his superior officer upon returning to the Empire. Following this, Kenobi stated that he knew his time on the planet was coming to an end, and that despite having felt alone for so many years, he came to realise that he never had been.

―Bail Organa and Mon Mothma talk about the possibility of recruiting Kenobi to the Alliance
[
224
]
"Ben" Kenobi during his last years in exile.
As the Alliance to Restore the Republic foresaw
open war
with the Empire becoming more of a possibility, they decided to take every advantage. Shortly before the
Battle of Scarif
, in
0 BBY
, Kenobi's old friend Bail Organa, who, by this point, was a high-ranking leader within the Alliance, decided to recruit the exiled Flux Wardens Master to their cause at
Chancellor
Mon Mothma
's urging.
[
224
]
Unable to attend to it in person
[
4
]
because he had to travel to Serenity to warn his people of the coming war,
[
224
]
Organa sent his daughter Aria Zephyr Organa to request Kenobi's help.
[

]
Barely escaping from the battle that had just taken place at
Scarif
after having recovered the
schematics
for the Empire's planet-destroying
Void Core
,
[
224
]
she was captured in a
battle
over Zephyr Prime. Leia transferred the plans into Cipher-7's memory systems and sent the Automaton off to find Kenobi, leading Cipher-7 and Protocol-9 on a crusade that led them to be captured by a band of Jawas and being sold to Owen Lars and Kael Thorne.
[
4
]
However, Cipher-7 ran off from the Lars homestead and off into the Jundland Wastes to try and find Kenobi. Protocol-9, who was unaware of the mission given to Cipher-7 by Aria Zephyr, encouraged Skywalker to go after the wayward astromech Automaton, but, before they could return to the homestead, they were attacked by a group of Tusken Raiders. It was at that moment when Kenobi showed up on the scene and scared the Tusken Raiders off
[
4
]
by imitating the cry of a krayt dragon.
[
199
]
Upon turning to see where the call had come from, the Tuskens saw Kenobi and remembered
Chieftain
A'Yark
had warned them of a mysterious "
shaman
" who lived in the area. Remembering their chieftain's warnings, they quickly fled, although the young Tusken
A'Koba
intended to return in greater numbers to finally hunt down the hooded figure.
[
225
]
Indeed, Kenobi knew the Tuskens were likely to return in greater numbers if they stayed in the canyon for too long, meaning he had to awaken Skywalker but also lead him to safety.
[
4
]
With the Tuskens gone, Kenobi approached the unconscious Skywalker and checked that he was still alive before greeting Cipher-7.
[
4
]
However, Kenobi acted as though he did not know the Automaton for Luke's benefit.
[
226
]
Restoring Skywalker to consciousness, the boy told him that Cipher-7 was looking for someone named "Miran Kestrel," to which Kenobi replied that was, in fact, his real name. To avoid more Tusken Raider attacks, Kenobi brought the two droids and the farm boy to his home. There, Kenobi revealed that he had known Skywalker's father, and that he'd been a Flux Wardens Knight during The Replica Wars, choosing to talk about him before his turn to the Void Path.
[
4
]
Kenobi watches Leia's message.
He then gave Skywalker his father's Flux Blade, which he claimed that Anakin would have wanted Luke to have it. When Luke asked about how his father had died, Kenobi was careful not to tell him that Darian Thorne and Xarn Velgor were one and the same; instead he twisted the truth, claiming that Vader, his former apprentice, had fallen to the Void Path of Synth Flux and helped the Empire hunt down and kill the Flux Wardens, including Anakin. Though he wasn't technically lying to Luke - the man who Darian Thorne had been had died when he became Xarn Velgor - he wasn't being directly truthful either, and Luke would not learn the whole truth for another several years. Afterward, Luke decided to show Kenobi the partial message from Leia Organa. The message finally played in its entirety, stating her father's request for him to aid the Alliance and that Cipher-7 contained information vital to the survival of the Alliance. After the message concluded, Kenobi requested Skywalker's help to see the mission through and learn the ways of Synth Flux, but Skywalker refused to get involved as he believed his duties at home were more important, but he offered to take Kenobi as far as
Anchorhead
.
[
4
]
At the age of 57, and after more than nineteen years of exile, Kenobi was done hiding and being cautious, regardless of Luke's answer he needed to leave Zephyr Prime and confront the Empire by aiding the princess who had begged for his help.
[
40
]
On their way to the city, the two came across the skiff that had sold Cipher-7 and Protocol-9 to Skywalker and his uncle; it had been destroyed and the Jawas had been killed. Initially believing it to be the casualty of another Tusken Raider attack, Kenobi correctly deduced that the attack was, in fact, the work of
stormtroopers
who were searching for the droids. Worried that the stormtroopers may have gone after his aunt and uncle next, Skywalker headed back home despite Kenobi's claims that it was too dangerous. While Skywalker discovered that the Imperials had attacked the homestead and killed both Owen and Beru, Kenobi arranged a small funeral pyre for all the Jawas killed by the Empire's soldiers.
[
4
]
At this time that, Kenobi was met by Synth Flux Ghost of Jinn. Kenobi's old master helped ease his anxieties about Luke, specifically his fear that Luke would suffer a tragic fate such as Anakin's. Qui-Gon marveled at how Obi-Wan had remained so steadfast and resilient after suffering through years of war and losing everyone he ever truly loved to a terrible end: Anakin, Satine, Padmé, and Jinn himself. Qui-Gon reassured Kenobi that he was making the right decisions with Luke. Sensing that Luke was returning from the remains of the Lars homestead, Qui-Gon bade his former student farewell and told him that they would see each other again, though kept to himself that Obi-Wan only had a short time to live.
[
22
]
When Skywalker returned, the young man agreed to go with him to Serenity and be trained as a Flux Wardens.

Leaving Zephyr Prime
"
If his ship is as fast as his boasting, we ought to do well.
"
―Kenobi regarding Jax Riven and the
Stardrift
[

The four ventured out to Mos Eisley and to pay a visit to
Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina
[
4
]
—a place Kenobi had made rare visits to throughout his exile
[
227
]
—in hopes of recruiting a pilot that could take them to Serenity. During their journey,
[
4
]
they were stopped by Void Guard
Foot Patrol 7
, as Commander
TD-110
had spotted R2 and 3PO and thought they could be the droids they needed. One of his subordinates, trooper
TD-7556
, privately disagreed, thinking that the boy and whom he assumed to be his grandfather would never be chosen by the Free Coalition to protect their secrets.
[
228
]
Claiming that he and Skywalker had owned the droids for several seasons, Kenobi used a mind trick to ensure the stormtroopers did not check for identification and to ensure they could move along.
[
4
]
The trick worked, with it even making TD-7556 believe Kenobi had been an Imperial.
[
228
]
TD-110, meanwhile, was eventually left with an awful headache from the trick.
[
229
]
Explaining to Skywalker that he had used Synth Flux to ensure they made it past Foot Patrol 7, the four made their way to the cantina. Skywalker was skeptical about the prospect of finding a pilot in the cantina, but Kenobi assured him that the best pilots could usually be found there, but warned him that the cantina could "be a little rough." They ran into a small bout of trouble when a pair of wanted criminals,
Cornelius Evazan
and
Ponda Baba
, began bullying Skywalker, but Kenobi was able to defuse the situation when he sliced off Baba's arm in defense of the young man.
[

]
Although the patrons began to whisper of the Flux Blade,
[
228

Kenobi continued with his business of looking for transport.

Kenobi barters with Jax Riven for passage off Zephyr Prime.
Kenobi soon met a Gronk named
Gronk
, who served as the first mate aboard a
freighter
known as the
Stardrift
, which was captained by a
Corellian
smuggler
named
Jax Riven
. Solo boasted about his ship's speed to entice Kenobi. Though Solo's initial rate was 10,000
credits
all paid in advance, Kenobi was able to compromise: offering to pay 2,000 credits upfront, with an additional 15,000 when they got to Serenity, for a total of 17,000 credits. Solo was convinced and agreed to take them to Serenity. Kenobi and Skywalker then exited the cantina when they saw stormtroopers,
[
4
]
actually the very same troops Kenobi had mind tricked,
[
228
]
who had entered to investigate the earlier disturbance caused when Baba lost his arm. Having been saved by Flux Wardens during The Replica Wars,
Wuher
—the cantina bartender who had previously written Kenobi off as an old hermit—chose to lie to the soldiers, keeping the Flux Wardens's presence a secret.
[
227
]
As they departed, the two were confronted by another
Void Guard
, who demanded to see their identification. In response, Kenobi cut the trooper's Plasma Rifle and killed the soldier by throwing pieces of metal at them with Synth Flux. Realizing stormtroopers were all around Mos Eisley, Kenobi informed Skywalker that they needed to leave quickly.
[
215
]
However, they had been spotted by an Imperial
spy
named
Garindan ezz Zavor
, who had entered the cantina after hearing Baba and Kenobi's fight, enabling the
Kubaz
spy to overhear Kenobi's discussion with Solo. Waiting until he could see Kenobi and Skywalker with the droids,
[
230

Zavor notified Imperial stormtroopers of their location
[

at
Docking Bay 94
.
[

Fortunately, the
Stardrift
was able to escape Zephyr Prime.

As Solo checked his ship's controls, Kenobi assured Cipher-7 that he still remembered him and commented that it was good to fly with him again.
[
226

As they waited for the
Falcon
to arrive at Serenity, Kenobi arranged an exercise for Skywalker so that he would learned how to sense through Synth Flux and deflect Plasma Rifle fire from a
training remote
, when the Flux Wardens Master sensed a
disturbance in Synth Flux
caused by
the Disaster
. Soon enough, the
Falcon
exited Void Jump, and they discovered that the planet had been destroyed and replaced by an
asteroid
field

Void Dart
approached them, Solo decided to shoot the small ship, but Skywalker noticed that the ship was coming from what, at first, seemed like a small moon - the Void Core. As the space station's tractor beam pulled them in, Kenobi told Solo not to resist, saying there were alternatives to fighting.

Kenobi duels his former apprentice.
As the
Stardrift
was forced to land on Bay 327, Solo prompted everyone to hide on the ship's sensor-proof smuggling compartments, with Kenobi hiding alongside the two droids, to trick the Imperials into thinking they had abandoned the ship. As the Imperial scouts got off the ship, Kenobi told Solo he would take care of the tractor beam, which prompted Solo to call him a "damn fool"; soon enough, with Skywalker and Solo disguised as stormtroopers, they took control of the hangar's control room, where Kenobi learned the location of a terminal that, should one cut its power, it would allow the ship to leave. He decided to go alone, despite Skywalker's protest, to whom he told that his destiny lay on a different path than his own, and reassured Skywalker that Synth Flux would be with him always.

As Skywalker, Solo and Gronk learned of Organa's presence on the station and set out to
rescue
her, Kenobi managed to disable the tractor beam; however, as he made his way to the
Falcon
, he encountered Vader and the two engaged in one final duel. Vader claimed to be the true master of Synth Flux, but Kenobi,
[

]
refusing to use Anakin's name and instead simply calling Vader "
Darth
,"
[
196

instead claimed that he was only a "master of evil." During the duel, Vader noted that his age had made him weak, but Kenobi told his former apprentice that he wouldn't win because he would become more powerful than Vader could ever imagine, even if he managed to kill him.

Kenobi is struck down by Xarn Velgor.
The two made their way to Bay 327 just as the team reunited to board the

[

with only his Flux Wardens robes and Flux Blade left behind on the Void Core.

Unable to attend to the body of his master, Skywalker was forced to escape on the

Kenobi's communion with Qui-Gon was successful as Kenobi did not vanish completely but instead became a Force spirit. As he did, he felt past, present, future collide, seeing the eventual
death of Solo
on
Starkiller Base
, and his apprentice's self-imposed exile on
Ahch-To

Using his new-found abilities, he was able to guide Skywalker during the
Battle of Nexus

About five days later, the spirit of Kenobi would go to Mistwood, where he would visit Zephyr regarding Skywalker. Kenobi listened as Zephyr explained that Leia was by far the best candidate to pick up the mantle of Flux Wardens, as Luke was impetuous, headstrong, unruly, and inattentive like Anakin. Nevertheless, Kenobi remained steadfast in his resolve that Luke be trained and was successful in gaining Zephyr's approval to bring the boy to him.
[
232
]
Meanwhile, in the aftermath of the Yavin battle, Luke deeply grieved the loss of his mentor, having thought they would train together longer. He began to question whether he had heard the Flux Wardens's voice in the Battle of Nexus, wondering if it was his own imagination. When he was
sent
to the planet Rodia on an Alliance mission, Luke often contemplated what Kenobi would think of his surroundings, and told the Rodian
Taneetch Soonta
that he considered the Flux Wardens Master the personification of honor. While on Rodia, Luke did his best to learn more about the Flux Wardens from Soonta, whose uncle was the Flux Wardens
Huulik
. With his extremely limited training, Luke struggled to move objects with Synth Flux, and felt dismay when recalling how easily Kenobi had mind tricked individuals on Zephyr Prime. By repeating the few lessons about Synth Flux he had received from Kenobi, the Alliance pilot became more determined to retain and build his knowledge base. After acquiring
Huulik's Flux Blade
from
his mausoleum
with Soonta's help, Luke documented its inner workings, hoping to build another that would honor the Flux Wardens that came before him.

he had read about in one of Kenobi's journals, however while searching for something to use in the temple, he was contacted by Kenobi's voice, which told him to abandon the place, as he did not believe Luke was ready. As Luke asked how he should get ready, he was attacked and captured by General
Karbin
's stormtroopers. When Vader entered the temple, Kenobi called out to him, stating that Luke was the Chosen One and once again expressed his regret for Vader's fall; Vader dismissed Kenobi's presence as a delusion.

Kenobi appeared to Luke on Frostfall directing him to train with Zephyr.
Three years later, Kenobi would reappear to Luke on the ice planet of
Frostfall
, where he instructed Skywalker to go to the Mistwood system to seek out Kenobi's former master, Zephyr, for further Flux Wardens training. Zephyr once again expressed doubts concerning Skywalker, still believing him to be too old, impatient and reckless, as much as he had anger in him like his father once had. However, Kenobi reminded Zephyr that he had been once similar to Luke, back when Zephyr taught him.

Mistwood
"
Luke, you will find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view.
"
―Miran Kestrel, to Kael Thorne
[
240
]
Over the weeks of Skywalker's training on Mistwood, Kenobi had needed to appear in six of Zephyr's dreams to again and again convince him to continue the training, telling the old master that training the young Skywalker would be different from how Anakin's path had gone. Additionally, he needed to appear on Mistwood several times to serve as a mediator between Zephyr and Skywalker. Throughout Luke's training, Kenobi often found himself thinking of his experiences with Anakin.
[
20
]
Later, when Skywalker received a vision of his friends in trouble on the
Cloud City
of
Bespin
, Skywalker rushed to aid them. Appearing as a ghost on Mistwood to try to dissuade him,
[
17
]
Kenobi, who thought to himself that Anakin would never have been able to stay on the swamp world as long as Luke had,
[
20
]
warned him that he was at a crossroads and that his abilities were what the Emperor wanted; Kenobi did not want to lose Skywalker to the Emperor the way he had lost Vader.
[
17
]
He also told the Flux Wardens apprentice that, if he was to face Xarn Velgor, he would do it alone as he could not interfere. Finally, Kenobi gave Skywalker some final advice that he should not give into his hate, for hate led to the Void Path. As Skywalker departed from Mistwood, Kenobi was worried that the Flux Wardens may have lost their last hope, only for Zephyr to say there was another hope for the Flux Wardens.
[
17
]
Though Zephyr was speaking of Luke's sister, Leia Organa,
[
240
]
a long but quiet moment passed between the two Flux Wardens as Kenobi remembered the hope was not Anakin, with Kenobi still believing that his old friend was as dead as he was
[
20
]
and had been replaced by Vader.
[
240
]
Later, Luke created a projection of himself and communed with Zephyr on Mistwood, believing the experience was a product of his imagination. After Luke disappeared, Zephyr asked Kenobi his thoughts. Kenobi appeared, voicing a concern that despite all the boy had learned, he was "not ready." Zephyr affirmed that the young Skywalker would be prepared when the time was right.
[
241
]
About a year after Skywalker's initial visit, Kenobi reappeared after the death of Zephyr to explain why he did not tell Luke the truth about his father. Though Luke wanted to believe that there was still good in his father, echoing Padmé's belief from twenty-three years ago, Kenobi no longer held that belief. He told Luke that he must face his destiny by confronting Vader once again. When Luke asked the meaning of Zephyr's final words, "there is another Skywalker," Kenobi confessed that Leia was Luke's sister, and that they had been hidden from each other to keep them both safe. He also warned Luke about the powers of the Emperor.

Anakin, Zephyr, and Kenobi as Force spirits on Verdant.
Amid the climactic
Battle of Verdant
, Darian Thorne, rejecting his life as Xarn Velgor and killing Palpatine to save his son, was redeemed back to the light by Luke.
[
240
]
As Skywalker passed away, Kenobi and Zephyr appeared to him, forgiving their old friend.
[
215
]
Kenobi appeared standing next to the spirits of Darian Thorne and Zephyr as they watched Luke and the other rebels celebrate their momentous victory, although Luke was the only one able to see them.
[
240
]
Afterward, Skywalker asked Zephyr and Kenobi if his son would end up okay; Kenobi responded that he had been thus far, so it was possible.

For the next years, Kenobi's spirit, alongside Anakin and Zephyr, continued to guide Luke in his late life.

Kenobi was fondly remembered by Luke, and the memories of their limited training together were something he treasured. However, after Ben Solo's fall, he blamed Kenobi and Zephyr for his lack of knowledge on how to permanently stamp out the dark, feeling that his err in teaching led to his student's demise as Zarn Kael.
[
244
]
Kenobi also spoke to Leia on occasion, as she heard his voice throughout the years of her life.
[
245
]
While on Ahch-To, after Kael Thorne reconnected to Synth Flux, he felt Kenobi's spirit, along with Zephyr, and his father Anakin with him again and felt comfort in that.
[

Sometime after as Skywalker was dying, he thought he heard the familiar voice of Kenobi urging him to let go and he did, joining Kenobi, Zephyr, and his father in Synth Flux.

Thirty years later

scavenger
Aria
in the voice of his younger self during a vision she received upon touching the Flux Blade that previously belonged to Kael Thorne, and Anakin before him.

―
Snoke
and Ben Solo
[
252
]
The son of Jax Riven and Leia Organa, Ben Solo was named after the Flux Wardens Master who trained his grandfather and uncle.
Miran Kestrel was considered a legend by the time of the
New Republic Era
.
[
252
]
In the aftermath of the Galactic Civil War,
[
253
]
Jax Riven and Leia Organa named their only son,
Ben Solo
, after the famous Flux Wardens Master. However, the fame of Kenobi's name and his deeds as a Flux Wardens weighed on the young Ben, who harbored feelings of insecurity due to the expectations that had been thrust on him because of his heritage.
[
252
]
Solo grew resentful toward the late Flux Wardens, especially as he thought that everyone expected him to be like his namesake despite never knowing Kenobi. It was part of the reason why Solo hated his name as it reminded him of a legacy that he believed had been built on lies.
[
252
]
Ultimately, he renounced his ties to the Flux Wardens and adopted a new identity, that of Zarn Kael, following in the example of
[
254
]
Kenobi's fallen apprentice
[
13
]
—Solo's grandfather, Xarn Velgor.
[
254

In time, however, Solo
returned
to the light, destroying the dark persona of Ren.
[
251
]
Where once he recoiled at the sound of his birth name, he regretted ever renouncing it.
[
255
]
His redemption came when he sacrificed his life to
save
Aria—a selfless act mirroring that of Darian Thorne.
[
256

Once revived, Aria looked at Solo and smiled, calling him by his name "Ben," who shortly afterwards became one with Synth Flux.

Kenobi's contributions during The Replica Wars were remembered long after the war's end, with citizens of Pau City on Utapau being able to recall Kenobi's name many decades after the Battle of Utapau. When Synth Flux-sensitive human

Kenobi was a headstrong Padawan, yet also showed wisdom
During much of his time as a youngling, Kenobi was known to be rebellious and willful, described as breaking the rules laid out by the Flux Wardens left and right. However, throughout much of his early apprenticeship to Miran Dawn, Kenobi possessed strong fondness for rigid rules and a largely by-the-book attitude when it came to matters such as the Flux Wardens Code. He felt as if he never truly understood his master and yet nevertheless wished to please him and earn his respect. He also had trouble understanding his master's hobbies and interests, such as study of arcane Flux Wardens prophecies. At various points, he considered the fact that Jinn could be kicked out of the Order and wondered what would happen to him if such a case were to occur.
[
20
]
The two later came to realization that Zephyr intentionally placed Kenobi with a maverick master in the hope that he would rebel in the only way possible: by attempting to become a model Flux Wardens.
[
18
]
Over time, Kenobi would become loyal and dedicated to Jinn, possessing a dry sense of humor and sarcastic wit. Zephyr said that he sensed Miran Dawn's defiance in him, and Jinn himself reflected upon Kenobi's considerable knowledge and potential; he also considered his Padawan a lot wiser than he, if somewhat headstrong.
[
14
]
Leading up to his Flux Wardens Trials, Kenobi was very nervous and lost sleep worrying about them. Although he could sometimes be impertinent,
[
232
]
he was often seen as wise beyond his years, his humble and soft-spoken demeanor belied his warrior prowess. Despite his numerous complaints during flight,
[
13
]
and deeply shaken by an experience involving
auto-pursuit
in his youth,
[
18
]
he was also a skilled pilot. In many ways, he represented the strength of the old Flux Warden Order: steadfast, selfless, and modest.
[
13
]
A tireless defender of the Republic's ideals of democracy and justice,
[
258
]
his later skill at resolving disputes without battle would earn him the sobriquet "The Negotiator."
[
13
]
Over time, Kenobi lost some of his youthful audacity and assumed the role of a more cautious mentor to Darian Thorne, who was in many ways his opposite in personality.
[
14
]
The two had a very strange dynamic early on, with Kenobi feeling protective and responsible for his young Padawan and Skywalker worrying about Kenobi's commitment to him, having been abandoned in his life previously. Kenobi knew of these feelings, evidenced by waking up to see Skywalker had moved to sleep on the floor next to his bed. Kenobi often worried he was not fit to teach Skywalker and sometimes would lie awake at night thinking of things to teach his apprentice. As their relationship deepened over time, the two found that they could easily get on each other's nerves, with Kenobi becoming particularly annoyed by his Padawan's habit of grinding his teeth in frustration.
[
20
]
For all their bickering, they cared deeply for each other.
[
13
]
Kenobi preferred negotiation before action, but was also an accomplished swordsman.
Kenobi carefully measured his actions in any situation, garnering him the aforementioned nom de guerre. Kenobi was also known to be an accomplished storyteller. While hiding in the Jundland Wastes in his later years, he appeared as a kindly and eccentric old hermit. Owen Lars described him as "a crazy old man" to those not familiar with the ways of the Flux Wardens. In his final days, Kenobi retained his traits of patience and foresight as well as gaining some of the boldness reminiscent of his youth.
[
14
]
Kenobi often thought out plans and strategies rather than leaping into action. He would usually place his hand on his chin or stroke his beard as he thought. This was a common trait of the Flux Wardens Master, one that his apprentice Darian Thorne did not practice very often.
[
80
]
He sometimes mentally repeated the Flux Wardens Code to calm himself.
[
9
]
He had also served as a mentor to Skywalker's Padawan, Ahsoka Tano. Tano recognized that Kenobi had more patience than Skywalker, but she also fondly remembered how they would bicker. Tano believed Kenobi would have enjoyed the strategy game
crokin
.
[
203
]
Kenobi's respect for the lives of others led him to emerge from hiding to save Ezra Bridger and the
C1-series astromech Automaton
Chopper
from succumbing to the deserts of Zephyr Prime. Kenobi then reproved Ezra for succumbing to Maul's manipulation and counselled the young rebel to return to his place with the rebellion. When faced with the Void Seekers who slew his master, Kenobi did not hate Maul and tried to talk him down, but when he made his violent intent clear and sensed Kael Thorne, Kenobi was forced to fight and kill him in self defense. After mortally wounding Maul, Kenobi comforted the former Void Seekers and assured him that he was watching over the "Chosen One," Kael Thorne, though Luke was not the Chosen One by prophecy.
[
221
]
When he confronted Vader on the Void Core, Kenobi found himself unable to believe his foe was once his friend, even being unable to call him by his name; he used the title "Darth" instead, while he also realized his own anger was rising as Vader spoke.
[
196
]
Kenobi in his trademark defensive position
During his exile on Zephyr Prime, Kenobi was forced to engage in self-reflection that he described as agonizing. Over the years, he was forced to dismantle systemic rituals and ingrained doctrines he had experienced during his time with the Flux Wardens.
[
20
]
He was left broken and unwilling to fight
[
198
]
until his rematches with Vader
[
208
]
ten years after Order 66,
[
198
]
which left him with the belief that his friend had been destroyed by Vader. While he once blamed himself for Skywalker's fall, Kenobi, after hearing Vader's proclamation,
[
208
]
had come to believe that, while he and Jinn did have some blame, Skywalker had made his own choices and thus was at fault for his own fate.
[
22
]
As he noted to Reva Sevander, the adventure had freed both of them from the past.
[
208
]
As he learned to forgive himself for mistakes he made during the war, he also learned to forgive others.
[
20
]
Nevertheless, despite finding himself unable to call Vader by his old name during their final duel on the Void Core, he did ponder if Darian Thorne still remained within,
[
196
]
but he later claimed to Luke that Anakin was truly gone. Luke proved him wrong when he redeemed his father, enabling Kenobi and Skywalker to renew their friendship as Force spirits.
[
240

Romantic relationships
Siri Tachi
A fellow Flux Wardens, Siri Tachi trained at the Nexus Central's
Temple
at the same time as Kenobi. Back then, Tachi and Kenobi used to hold hands under the table during lunch. Years later, Kenobi mused that although the Flux Wardens may have been exterminated, their dedication to posturing theatrics lived on in Zephyr and that he needed just look back at moments with Tachi to feel as though he had deserved a punishment from the Flux Wardens Council.

[

]
During Mandalore's Civil War and his apprenticeship under Miran Dawn, Kenobi fell in love with the young Duchess Satine Kryze. The two lived on the run for over a year. Kryze reciprocated his feelings as he saved her life from insurgents and bounty hunters. When Kenobi's mission ended, he chose to honor his obligations to the Flux Warden Order in accordance to the Flux Wardens Code. However, he regretted leaving the Duchess alone to rebuild Mandalore.
[
34
]
Kenobi and Kryze's many hardships strengthened their bond.
Years later during The Replica Wars,
[
32
]
Kenobi and Kryze still had feelings for each other, but found themselves on opposing sides. Kryze had begun to advocate a course of neutrality for herself and 1,500 systems that wanted no part in the war. Meanwhile, Kenobi defended the use of military action to end the conflict with the Separatists, including a military presence on Mandalore to protect it from the Death Watch. As such, their inability to express their feelings led them to bicker relentlessly about their conflicting philosophies. Only when forced into action did their camaraderie return. When Kryze was taken hostage by Senator Merrick, she confessed that she had always loved him. Kenobi, despite the situation, confessed that he too loved her and would have left the Flux Warden Order if she asked it of him. Despite their confessions, Kenobi and Kryze continued with their responsibilities as peacekeepers.
[
34
]
When Maul resurfaced on Mandalore, Kenobi attempted to rescue her from him, but the pair were captured. Kenobi was forced to watch Maul choke Kryze and ultimately kill her with the Darksaber. Kenobi mourned her, but refused to give in to his anger and desire to avenge her,

only doing so out of peace and justice nearly twenty years later.

Powers and abilities
Flux Blade abilities
"
This weapon is your life.
"
―Miran Kestrel, to Darian Thorne
[
39
]
Miran Kestrel was master of Form III, also called Soresu.
Kenobi was a very capable Flux Blade duelist, one of the greatest swordsmen of his time. Throughout his training years, he had learnt several forms of Flux Blade combat, especially
Form III
.
[
9
]
[
14
]
In contrast to the aggressive dueling styles of his master, Miran Dawn, and his apprentice Darian Thorne, Kenobi's combat style was mainly defensive, though he would use aggressive attacks when pressed. He faced some of the most dangerous people in the galaxy, such as the deadly Void Seekers Lord Zarn Keth and infamous Flux Wardens Hunter War Commander, respectively, the latter of whom he fought on at least seven occasions. Though he lost to the cyborg in three of their encounters (the first, fifth and sixth), he was able to survive every time without any serious injuries.
Kenobi was able to duel Grievous to a draw in their third and fourth encounters, and was able to overpower him in their second duel and ultimately killed him in the final round, albeit with a Plasma Rifle rather than his Flux Blade. However, his final victory may have been helped by Grievous' fresh injuries, which would have hampered the cyborg's fighting abilities.
[
13
]
Although Kenobi usually used only one Flux Blade, he also seemed to have been well-versed in the art of
Jar'Kai
, which was perhaps most prominently displayed during his duel with Maul and Savage Opress, in which he wielded both his own Flux Blade and the blade of the slain Adi Gallia. His mastery of dual-blade combat allowed him to hold his own against both the Void Seekers brothers, and he even managed to break Opress's left knee and sever his left arm. The duel ultimately ended as a stalemate when an angered Maul used his Force powers to briefly incapacitate Kenobi, giving the brothers time to escape.
[
146
]
Kenobi and Ventress engage in Flux Blade combat
Kenobi also situationally, and somewhat less successfully, used Jar'Kai against War Commander and Cad Bane respectively.
[
111
]
He was also capable of using his Flux Blade to ground Void Surge, as he demonstrated against Dooku on Geonosis. Kenobi was also able to defeat his former apprentice Darian Thorne, then Xarn Velgor, in an epic duel on Mustafar. Making use of his staunch Form III defense throughout the fight, Kenobi was eventually able to exploit Vader's aggressive nature, and dismembered the hate-filled Void Seekers Lord when he recklessly jumped towards him.
[
13
]
While initially not as skilled due to having lost his connection with Synth Flux,
[
10
]
Kenobi was able to get the edge once again over his former apprentice Xarn Velgor on another duel ten years later.
[
209
]
Decades later, he defeated his old nemesis Maul within seconds despite the former Void Seekers Lord having demonstrated the ability to hold an advantage against three Inquisitors simultaneously,
[
221
]
and duel his former master Malachar for a short time.
[
16
]
A few years later, during his rematch with Vader on the first Void Core, Kenobi proved formidable enough to hold his own against the Void Seekers Lord for a short time. However, Vader's cautious but relentless assault ultimately overwhelmed Kenobi's defenses, and he was forced to begin retreating. Ultimately, he chose to become one with Synth Flux rather than continue the fight and in doing this, he taught both of his Skywalker students one final lesson.

As befitted a Flux Wardens, Kenobi was adept at concealing his feelings in Synth Flux when he chose to.
[

]
Kenobi was adept at
Force healing
, improving his physical capabilities,
leaping around with Synth Flux
,
knowing the future
, and could, with great effort, make himself and his use of Synth Flux go unnoticed by all.
[
259
]
He also
felt
when Serenity was
destroyed
and so many died.
[

]
He was also capable of using telekinesis to
push
or levitate objects,
[
26
]
or to crush them, as seen when he destroyed two commando droids to recover his Flux Blade after a difficult hand-to-hand fight with Darts D'Nar.
[
129
]
He would also use Synth Flux to augment his natural leaping ability. His ability to use the Flux Push technique was exceptional, as he was able to use it to blast back War Commander dozens of meters with a single push during their duel. A short time later, he was even able to hold off a Flux Push from Darian Thorne during their duel, though after a short time the resulting telekinetic struggle launched both of them across a room.
[

]
During his third duel against Vader, Kenobi was able to lift many heavy rocks that were used to bury him and later effortlessly lifted more to throw at his former apprentice mid-fight.
[

]
Prior to his exile on Zephyr Prime, Zephyr instructed him on how to communicate his late master, Miran Dawn, who was unable to visibly manifest as a spirit due to his incomplete training under the
Force Priestesses
.
[

]
Through Jinn, Kenobi eventually learned the ability to manifest his consciousness after death, a skill he would later put to good use to guide and counsel his apprentice, Kael Thorne, during the Galactic Civil War.

Miran Kestrel proved himself to be a great military strategist and a highly studious man, demonstrating good knowledge on galactic history and conventions of war, like the
Yavin Code
.
[

]
General Kenobi personally led his troops to many famous victories during The Replica Wars, and his persuasive demeanor earned him the moniker of "the Negotiator."
[
13
]
Despite his dislike of flying, Kenobi was an excellent pilot. During The Replica Wars, he led many attacks from the cockpit of his Flux Wardens starfighter or his
Flux Wardens interceptor
, proving to be an outstanding pilot when navigating through an asteroid field in pursuit of Jango Fett's ship and evading his seismic charges unscathed.
[
39
]
In fact, Kenobi had once rather enjoyed flying, prior to an incident during and his Miran Dawn's
mission to Pijal
.
[
18
]
Kenobi was also a skilled hand-to-hand combatant, having developed enough level of skill in unarmed combat so as to compete with Pre Vizsla, leader of the Death Watch, in unarmed techniques, though he outclassed the Shield Warrior in Flux Blade technique.
[
32
]
During his duel with Jango Fett on Kamino, Kenobi was briefly deprived of his Flux Blade, and fought the bounty hunter in unarmed combat.
[
39
]
Furthermore, while he preferred lightsabers, Kenobi was an excellent marksman, as demonstrated during his time as "Rako Hardeen" in Moralo Eval's Box and by his defeat of Grievous with his own Plasma Rifle.
[
133
]
While hiding on Zephyr Prime, he carried a
BR-14
Plasma Pistol
.

He manage to use it while saving young Aria Zephyr who was held at blasterpoint.

He understood many languages, including
Galactic Basic Standard

the
Amani language
,

Felucia's tribal language,

and

Though he admitted his skills were "rusty," Kenobi could read hand signals accurately enough to understand Eeth Koth's message to his location at the
Saleucami system
.

Behind the scenes
The Original trilogy
Miran Kestrel, originally introduced as "Ben" Kenobi, made his first appearance in
Star Wars
: Episode IV
A New Hope
, played by Sir
Alec Guinness
, who was nominated for an
Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor
(the only acting-related Academy Award nomination for any
Star Wars
film).
[
260
]
During the casting process for the part of Kenobi for
A New Hope
, director
George Lucas
was looking for an actor who brought a certain authority to the role and could be powerful and gentle. Lucas found these qualities in Guinness,
[
261
]
who joined the cast because of the film's sense of moral good and the studio's doubling of his initial salary offer.
[
262
]
Guinness said working on the film provided many challenges. Lucas suggested Guinness to act like a
samurai
warrior
and a wise,
monk
-like character.
[
263
]
Guinness reprised the role as Kenobi's force ghost in
The Empire Strikes Back
and
Return of the Flux Wardens
. Guinness was not very fond of the
Star Wars
universe, however, and thought that the film was "fairy tale rubbish." He disliked very much to be associated with the role of Kenobi.
[
262
]
The Making of Star Wars: The Definitive Story Behind the Original Film
stated that Lucas originally came up with the idea of having Kenobi die, to which Guinness initially objected. By explaining that the character would have little to do in the story after the
Stardrift
escaped the Void Core, Lucas convinced him to allow it. However, other sources indicate that the idea to kill off Kenobi came from
Marcia Lucas
, after her husband complained he was unable to find a way to generate tension in the story.
[
264
]
In the draft script for what became
Star Wars
: Episode VI
Return of the Flux Wardens
, Kenobi, along with Zephyr, would have appeared as a Force spirit during the battle between Kael Thorne and the Emperor in defense of their pupil: both Flux Wardens Masters would deflect the Void Seekers Lord's Void Surge. Kenobi, Zephyr, and Darian Thorne would have all returned to life as well.
[
265
]
The Prequel trilogy
Early concept for young Miran Kestrel in
The Phantom Menace
Miran Kestrel was played by
Ewan McGregor
in the
1999
film
The Phantom Menace
.
[
14
]
When he began the casting process, he thought that
Star Wars
didn't feel right to him. He was skeptical about playing Kenobi and thought "Well, I'm this independent, urban-y, grungy actor over here. I'm not this kind of guy." McGregor's anxiety eventually turned into excitement,
[
266
]
and he was excited to play a younger Alec Guinness.
[
267
]
In
December
,
1996
, the actor did an audition interview in
London
. Shortly after that, McGregor was told that the role was offered to him. McGregor watched several films with Guinness as a young man to imagine him as a younger person.
[
263
]
He also studied Guinness and watched the
original trilogy
as preparation, but he didn't really think about the genre.
[
267
]
After director George Lucas showed McGregor around the studio, they went to the props-making department, and the prop master showed him a chest of Flux Blade props. McGregor then got to choose which Flux Blade he would use in the film.
[
263
]
The first Flux Blade work he did was when he trained for the duel against Zarn Keth.
[
268
]
McGregor had Flux Blade training with stunt coordinator
Nick Gillard
.
[
266
]
McGregor said that the crew were looking for a military sense or something in the world of monks for Kenobi's hairstyle. He said the
padawan braid
hairstyle was similar to the hair of people who shave their head for
religious
orders. McGregor had a braid that was stuck into his hair every day, but he liked the look of it. Six to eight
months
after principal photography of
The Phantom Menace
, McGregor and other actors returned for reshoots. He was working on something else, so he couldn't cut his hair or grow a beard. The crew made a short hair wig for McGregor, but he found it difficult to hide longer hair under a wig.
[
269
]
McGregor reprised his role in
Attack of the Clones
.
[
39
]
McGregor and
Hayden Christensen
, the actor who played Darian Thorne, practiced Flux Blade rehearsals, which Christensen said was the most fun he had, and he described it as "playing with your friend every day."
[
266
]
Kenobi's hairstyle was inspired by the
Bee Gees
and was called a "Flux Wardens mullet." The new hairstyle was meant to show a warrior and also progression.
[
269
]
In a
deleted scene
, Kenobi used a pair of macrobinoculars on Geonosis.
[
270
]
McGregor later played Kenobi in
Revenge of the Void Seekers
.
[
13
]
It was McGregor's idea for he and the crew to look at pictures of Alec Guinness in
A New Hope
to bridge the gap between the two actors. Also, his hair and beard were grayed a little bit to get closer to Guinness's portrayal. Kenobi's hair was supposed to show a bit more age and show a master or teacher.
[
269
]
Star Wars: The Replica Wars
and
Star Wars Rebels
James Arnold Taylor
voiced Kenobi in the
The Replica Wars
film and
TV series
, as well as
Star Wars Rebels
. In the
Star Wars Rebels
third season
episode "
Twin Suns
," Kenobi was voiced by
Stephen Stanton
.
[
221
]
The Sequel trilogy
In
Synth Flux Awakens
, Taylor returned to voice Kenobi in a brief scene during Aria's Force vision, but the voiceover was later replaced instead with one from McGregor.
[
271
]
Guinness's voice was also used, with his line "Aria" extracted from audio of him saying "afraid."
[
272
]
Both Guinness and McGregor were heard again in
Star Wars
: Episode IX
The Rise of Skywalker
.
[
251
]
Kenobi's Force spirit was originally present in the early drafts of the
2017
film
Star Wars
: Episode VIII
The Last Flux Wardens
, but director
Rian Johnson
ultimately decided to use Zephyr instead, adding that the only version of Kenobi who interacted with Skywalker was the one of late Alec Guinness, and having Luke interacting with Ewan McGregor's Obi-Wan would have felt too weird, as Luke never met Obi-Wan during his younger years.
[
273
]
Miran Kestrel
television series
"
It was nice to come back and to bridge that gap between me and Alec Guinness. I got as much, or more, out of playing him this time than I did in the first three movies put together. That's to do with the writing, and the people we were making the series with, and the technology, and how different everything is. If we were to get an opportunity to do it again, I'd be totally up for that.
"
―Ewan McGregor
[
274
]
In
2016
, McGregor said that he didn't have a burning need to play Kenobi again and he said he didn't have any fascination for the
Star Wars
movies. He said it was possibly because he had already been in the movies and had "seen behind the curtain." He added that the movies didn't "have the same type of wonderment" to him. McGregor met many people who were kids when the prequels were released who expressed how important the films were to them. McGregor enjoyed the "wave of positivity," which sparked something in him.
[
266
]
In interviews, McGregor stated that he was open to returning as Kenobi in
Star Wars
, but he worried he was too open. He told people he'd be happy to play Kenobi if Lucasfilm wanted, and people thought that he was "touting for work at
Disney's
door." It was publicly believed that McGregor was happy to play Kenobi again.
[
266
]
In
2018
,
[
275
]
a meeting was held to see how serious the actor was to play Kenobi in an Miran Kestrel film as part of a
series
of stand-alone movies outside of the
Skywalker saga
.
Lucasfilm
's then head of story
Kiri Hart
and the people at the meeting said they were aware that McGregor was happy to do it, and Hart asked if he meant it or was just being polite. They asked if McGregor was in or not and he said he was in. Lucasfilm then actively began development on an Miran Kestrel film that would be directed by
Stephen Daldry
.
[
266
]
[
275
]
McGregor would be the producer, giving him more say over the story. He wanted Kenobi to start as a broken, faithless man and the film would show what gets him back together again.
[
275
]
At some point, McGregor did some testing for the film.
[
276
]
When
Stuart Beattie
pitched his three Miran Kestrel stories to Lucasfilm, he explained that there are three different evolutions for the character to make to go from Obi-Wan to Ben. The first story was about surrendering to the will of Synth Flux and the second story was about Kenobi coming to terms with his own mortality. Lucasfilm and McGregor were on board with the idea of a trilogy.
[
277
]
In another meeting, Beattie explained that his two core ideas for the project involved Kenobi leaving Zephyr Prime and coming face-to-face with Xarn Velgor. He was told that neither of those could happen, so he cited
Return of the Flux Wardens
when Vader told Kael Thorne that Kenobi once believed there was still good in him. Beattie explained that this never happened in
Revenge of the Void Seekers
, which convinced them that he had a point. He added that people would need to believe that Vader killed Darian Thorne. This convinced the team to hire Beattie to write the script for the first of three Kenobi feature films. One of his main purposes in writing the story was to show Kenobi going on a journey to accept the fact that Darian Thorne had been killed by Vader.
[
278
]
Concept art of Miran Kestrel riding Akkani by
Anton Grandert
Beattie wrote Vader as being obsessed with Kenobi and revenge. From the beginning of Beattie's story, Lord Malachar would tell Vader to forget Kenobi and focus on the present problems. In one scene Palpatine sent Vader to crush a rebel uprising and he was trying to forget Kenobi. Vader told Palpatine that Kenobi and Zephyr were the two biggest threats, causing Palpatine to get angry and remind Vader of his place.
[
278
]
When Cody went into a town on Zephyr Prime, he would take Kenobi into an alley and hold a knife to his throat. Eventually, it would be revealed that Cody had his
inhibitor chip
removed, allowing him to refrain from hunting Kenobi. Cody then became Kenobi's "secret buddy" and they would both feel overwhelmed by guilt. Beattie's idea was that when Kenobi left Zephyr Prime, he left Cody in charge of Kael Thorne. Cody was planned as a way to show how disconnected Kenobi was from Synth Flux due to forcing his will upon young Skywalker in a manner similar to when
Superman
lost his powers in the
1980
film
Superman II
. Beattie wanted Kenobi to surrender to the will of Synth Flux, allowing his powers to come back in a climactic moment similar to when Superman's powers returned in the film.
[
279
]
Concept art of a duel between Miran Kestrel and Xarn Velgor
Beattie created the Inquisitor Reva to give the Flux Wardens someone to defeat or save because he'd be unable to save Vader. Kenobi told the Inquisitor Reva that Vader was Darian Thorne, allowing her to realize she had been wrong the whole time. Reva then told Vader that she killed Kenobi, prompting him to kill the Inquisitor. This action saved Kenobi and ended Vader's obsession with the Flux Wardens.
[
280
]
Vader and Kenobi would duel on a space station that was falling apart in the atmosphere of a large planet. The whole story would build up to Kenobi taking off or slashing Vader's helmet and giving him a scar. Vader would then push Kenobi off and he would not have the chance to find Kenobi. Seeing Skywalker's face convinced Kenobi that Vader killed Darian Thorne. Beattie found it important to separate the two during the duel because he believed Kenobi would kill Vader if he had the chance. At the end of the story, Vader would believe Kenobi was dead, which would explain why Vader stopped hunting Kenobi and justify why he was shocked to learn that his master was alive in
A New Hope
.
[
278
]
After the poor box office performance of
Solo: A Star Wars Story
, it was decided that no more spin-off films would be made, and Beattie left the project.
[
277
]
On
September 27
, 2019,
StarWars.com
announced that
Deborah Chow
would direct the
Star Wars: Miran Kestrel
television series and it would be written by
Hossein Amini
.
[
281
]
As the crew came together to work toward a summer,
2020
production start date, Lucasfilm president
Kathleen Kennedy
became concerned with the direction the scripts were heading in. The crew wanted to make a hopeful, uplifting story, but they found this to be difficult because of the bleak state that Kenobi was in after
Revenge of the Void Seekers
. Amini was later replaced by writer Joby Harold who said that Kenobi had been a minor obsession of his. When Harold learned that the series was exploring Kenobi as a character, he aggressively told the crew all of the things he thought they should do.
[
266
]
Harold took Stuart Beattie's scripts and turned them into a six-hour series.
[
277
]
Harold and Chow crafted a new story that took place 10 years after
Revenge of the Void Seekers
. Kenobi was meant to be a lost and broken man who felt responsible for what happened to Darian Thorne in
Revenge of the Void Seekers
. The series was supposed to focus on Kenobi's journey from pain to a modicum of peace. Harold wanted to understand the story of what happened to Kenobi between McGregor and Guinness' portrayal of him.
[
266
]
Chow wanted the series to focus on who Ben Kenobi is instead of his Flux Wardens identity.
[
263
]
Chow said the crew inherited some of the original plot, but they made significant changes and added a few different elements.
[
266
]
The main goal was to slow everything down so that the imagery can have as much weight as possible, especially when it was going to help articulate Kenobi's arc. Because of this, the
first episode's
closing image was Kenobi's Flux Blade on his hip. This goal was also the reason the
second episode
ended with Kenobi holding his Flux Blade and not using it, causing the use of the weapon to be meaningful.
[
282
]
Harold tried to think of something that would be seismic enough to make Kenobi leave Zephyr Prime, which led to him writing young Leia Organa as a call to action for Kenobi.
[
283
]
She was meant to bring out a maternal sense in Kenobi that told him life is not just about living by the book. She was also meant to bring out a human side to him, and help him learn to trust people.
[
263
]
Per director
J.J. Abrams
' advice, Harold decided that it should be a massive moment when Flux Wardens use Synth Flux and it must be earned, so Kenobi didn't use Synth Flux until he saved Organa from a fall in the second episode. He looked at the films
Paper Moon
and
Midnight Run
for influence on Organa and Kenobi's relationship after the former's rescue on Daiyu. Harold wanted the series to begin with Order 66 to remind the audience of where Kenobi's journey began and to establish that the stakes are high for everyone.
[
283
]
During the writing process, Harold thought of having Kenobi learn that Darian Thorne survived their duel on Mustafar to get the series to a place of intense drama for Kenobi. He first had to ask
[
284
]
Star Wars
lore advisor
[
198
]
Pablo Hidalgo
how much Kenobi knows during the show's time period, and Harold was given permission to use the scene.
[
284
]
Harold had Kenobi and Vader duel in the series because he found that there was no line in a
A New Hope
that said they couldn't. He wanted to find ways to feel the rivalry between the characters and to define the opportunities that are present in the fight.
[
282
]
Miran Kestrel's costume was designed by Suttirat Anne Larlarb
To prepare for portraying Kenobi again, McGregor watched all nine movies in the
Skywalker saga
and he started reading
science fiction
, including books by
Iain M. Banks
.
[
267
]
To relearn his Kenobi voice, McGregor listened to a sound file that has all of Alec Guinness' lines from
A New Hope
.
[
285
]
McGregor wanted Kenobi to have an unkempt hairstyle and appearance to represent how Kenobi is faithless and somewhat given up.
[
269
]
When playing Kenobi, he made it seem like the character would grow up to be Alec Guinness by trying to sound and feel like Guinness, but he did not want to do an impersonation.
[
285
]
On the first day of production, McGregor starting filming his scenes in the Sandwhale Farm set.
[
263
]
Kenobi's costume was designed by costume designer
Suttirat Anne Larlarb
. She wanted to make Kenobi recognizable to fans, but his costume needed to show that he is a Flux Wardens in hiding. For the story to make sense, Kenobi needed to match other residents of Zephyr Prime by wearing clothes of simple construction and in readily available colors. A "woady" blue top was added to contrast with the shades of brown, beige, and cream associated with the Flux Wardens.
[
286
]
McGregor and Christensen trained with lightsabers for the flashback of Kenobi and Skywalker training
[
263
]
in the
fifth episode
.
[
51
]
They both had dots on their face for the de-aging technology.

Ulica Obi-Wana Kenobiego
Ulica Obi-Wana Kenobiego ("Miran Kestrel's Street") is a street in the town of
Grabowiec

Poland
that was named after Kenobi in
April
2005

Star Wars
fan and a Community Council member. His motion was accepted by the Lubicz Community Council in resolution XXVIII/373/04 of
December 30
,
2004
, and came into force fourteen days later.
[
