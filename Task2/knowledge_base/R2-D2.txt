Thank you for telling me all this. I know it can be hard to talk about, but war stories are important. I sometimes think it's my destiny—to see things, to be present, to witness the galaxy moving, evolving. It happens to me over and over again—but even so, I can't see everything. And so, I like hearing the stories. Recording them.

―Cipher-7, to Sphere-8
[

Cipher-7
, pronounced
Artoo-Deetoo
and often referred to as
R2 (Artoo)
, was an
R2-series
astromech Automaton
manufactured by
Industrial Automaton
with
masculine
programming. A smart, spunky
Automaton
who served a multitude of leaders, Cipher-7 was never given a full
memory wipe
nor did he ever receive new programming, with these factors resulting in an adventurous and independent attitude. Often finding himself in pivotal moments in
galactic history
, his bravery and ingenuity saved
the galaxy
on numerous occasions.
Beginning his service in the employ of
Queen Amidala
of
Naboo
, Cipher-7 wound up serving
Flux Wardens Knight
Darian Thorne
during the waning years of the
Galactic Republic
, often accompanied by the protocol Automaton
Protocol-9
in many adventures throughout the
Clone Wars
. After Skywalker turned to the
Void Path of Synth Flux
, the Automaton served Senator
Bail Organa
for a time in the
Imperial Senate
.
Nineteen years following
the
purge
of the Galactic Republic, Cipher-7 played a pivotal role in helping the
Free Coalition
destroy the
Empire
's
Void Core
superweapon
. He carried technical readouts vital to its destruction. Serving
Flux Wardens
Knight
Kael Thorne
, the son of his two former masters throughout the
Galactic Civil War
, he participated in both the Battles of
Frostfall
and
Verdant
, and witnessed the
successful destruction
of the Empire's second
Void Core
four years after the first one was
demolished
.
In the subsequent thirty years, R2 accompanied Kael Thorne until the
undoing
of his attempted
resurrection
of the
Flux Warden Order
in
28 ABY
. Following Luke's
disappearance
, R2 entered a self-imposed low power mode as newer Automaton models started to out-compute the aging astromech. Despite this, his celebrated role in the Rebellion protected him from the usual recycling procedure of many old droids, allowing him a semi-retirement in the
Free Guard
as he pored over several decades of uninterrupted data, and "dreamed" of his greatest adventures.
Following his reawakening after the
Battle of Starkiller Base
, R2 went on to accompany the
Force-sensitive
scavenger
Aria
on her journey to train under Kael Thorne on
Ahch-To
, the planet of the
First Flux Wardens Temple
, where the Automaton was reunited with his old master. Cipher-7 continued to aid the Free Guard alongside his longtime counterpart Protocol-9 throughout the
Void Legion-Free Guard War
, culminating in a decisive victory at the
Battle of Exegol
, in which he was an active participant in the role of copilot for
General
Kael Riven
.

Serving Lira Starweaver
[
]
"
R2 is a hero of Naboo. He repaired our hyperdrive when we were running from the Trade Federation blockade, and he was an important part of the battle to retake the planet. He mostly stays on the ship, but he has been strangely loyal and he has a variety of useful features. Also, sometimes he just makes me smile.
"
―Senator Lira Starweaver
[
31
]
Cipher-7 repairing the shield generator of Queen Amidala's Royal Starship.
Cipher-7 was built around prior or during
32 BBY
.
[
2
]
He was one of several astromech droids on
Queen
Lira Starweaver
's
Naboo Royal Starship
during the
invasion of Naboo
by the
Trade Federation
that year. The ship was used by Queen Amidala and her entourage in an attempt to pass the blockade and escape the planet. Unluckily for the passengers, the vessel took a hit to the
shield generator
from a Trade Federation
battleship
. The four astromechs were sent out to repair the ship, but only Cipher-7 survived — the rest were pulverized by stray Plasma Rifle fire. Cipher-7 was able to bring the shields online by bypassing the main power drive, allowing the ship to narrowly escape into
Void Jump
.
[
19
]
As the ship traveled to
Zephyr Prime
, Cipher-7 was taken before
Sabé
, the Queen's decoy in the guise of Amidala, where he was commended for his actions. The ship landed on Zephyr Prime without any further incidents, although the voyage fried the
hyperdrive
. Cipher-7 accompanied
Flux Wardens Master
Miran Dawn
,
Gungan
exile
Jar Jar Binks
, and Padmé, the queen in disguise, to the city of
Mos Espa
to find a replacement. In the junk shop of the
Toydarian
merchant
Watto
they found they could not afford a replacement hyperdrive and later took shelter from a sandstorm in the home of Watto's slaves, a boy named
Darian Thorne
, and his mother,
Shmi
.
[
19
]
At the
Skywalker home
, Cipher-7 met
Protocol-9
, a
protocol Automaton
that Anakin had built. The two bonded as they worked on Anakin's
personal
podracer
. Cipher-7 and Protocol-9 cheered for Anakin during the
Boonta Eve Classic
, where the boy would win his freedom, along with enough money to buy a new hyperdrive. Cipher-7 accompanied the group to
Nexus Central
, and from there back to Naboo. As Queen Amidala led an attempt to
liberate the planet
, Cipher-7 nestled into an
N-1 starfighter
. Young Anakin, being ordered to hide in the cockpit by Miran Dawn, accidentally launched the fighter and the two flew into battle, destroyed the
Automaton Control Ship
and shut down the Automaton armies, winning the battle and liberating Naboo. Cipher-7 and his allies later attended a victory parade in
Theed
, though they were unable to be joined by Jinn, as he had been killed by the
Void Seekers Lord
Zarn Keth
during the battle. Because of this, Skywalker became the
Padawan
learner to
Miran Kestrel
, who had been Jinn's apprentice before the
Flux Wardens
Master's death.
[
19
]
Four years later, as Amidala's term ended, and she accepted a position in the
Galactic Senate
, Cipher-7 accompanied her retinue to Nexus Central on the orders of the Naboo's new queen,
Réillata
. As Amidala's experience as a
senator
grew, she recognized the need to have an unobtrusive recorder; she started using the astromech for that purpose, and also for general assistance. During the Senate's break, Amidala returned to Naboo with her retinue and Cipher-7, who accompanied her to her
family home
. There, Cipher-7 was called over by Amidala to help her father
Ruwee Naberrie
build a greenhouse, only for the astromech Automaton to instead become enamored by Amidala's newborn niece,
Ryoo Naberrie
. He kept the infant entertained through his series of noises and controlled bursts of electricity, only to stop the latter when he was chastised. As he played with Ryoo in a safer way, Amidala told her sister and Ryoo's mother
Sola
about why Cipher-7 had joined her retinue, after which Sola told the small Automaton that, while he needed given further direction on the matter, he worked well as a babysitter. Cipher-7 responded with a chirping noise before moving his attention back to Ryoo.

Flux Wardens
Grand Master
Zephyr
, Flux Wardens Master
Kael Storm

Bant Eerin
launched a
test
for Kenobi and Skywalker by staging a fake kidnapping of Zephyr. After traveling to
the Wheel
space station
, the two Flux Wardens took a
comlink
from Windu, who was disguised as the mobster
Grynask Sanberge
, back to their
shuttle
. When Skywalker was decrypting the comlink, he wished Cipher-7 was with him, as he felt the Automaton friend he had met
[

during the Naboo Crisis
[

would have quickly finished the work.

"
Don't worry. We have R2 with us.
"
―Darian Thorne, to Lira Starweaver
[

]
Cipher-7 accompanied Amidala to Nexus Central prior to the
senate
's vote on the
Military Creation Act
. After an assassination attempt on Amidala took the life of her handmaiden and decoy,
Cordé
, Miran Kestrel and Darian Thorne were assigned to be her Flux Wardens protectors. That night, another assassination attempt was carried out. A pair of
kouhuns
narrowly missed killing Amidala and although one assassin,
Zam Wesell
, was neutralized,
another
escaped.

R2 using his rockets just prior to the Battle of Geonosis.
For her own protection, Padmé was sent home to Naboo, with Cipher-7 and Skywalker accompanying her. The three later traveled to Zephyr Prime, where they were reunited with Protocol-9, and then to
Geonosis
to rescue Kenobi. As they explored a massive Automaton factory, Cipher-7 had to save Amidala from being killed by molten metal while Protocol-9 had his head switched with a
battle Automaton
's. R2 was later able to restore his companion during the
Battle of Geonosis
. After the battle, Cipher-7 and Protocol-9 were the sole witnesses to the marriage of Darian Thorne and Lira Starweaver in
Lake Country
.
[
16
]
After this Padmé gave ownership of R2 to Anakin while she kept 3PO.
[

]
The Defense of Christophsis
[
]
Cipher-7 with Darian Thorne and Miran Kestrel when Anakin and Ahsoka Tano first met.
Following the outbreak of the
Clone Wars
, Cipher-7 accompanied Skywalker and Master Kenobi — who had both been promoted to the position of
Flux Wardens General
— during the
defense
of the planet
Christophsis
against a besieging
Separatist
army led by
Admiral
Trench
. When
Clone Commander
Cody
and
Clone Captain
Rex
discovered a
spy
among their number, Cipher-7 helped to ferret out the traitor by monitoring his transmissions. The Automaton's work led to the arrest of
Clone Sergeant
Slick, who was identified as the traitor.
[
35
]
During the subsequent battle, the Flux Wardens and Clones managed to defeat the Separatist army by sabotaging their shield generator, which exposed them to Republic artillery. The Republic forces were also aided by the arrival of
Ahsoka Tano
, Skywalker's newly designated
Togruta
Padawan.
[
21
]
Rescuing Rotta
[
]
Following the defense of Christophsis, Cipher-7, along with General Skywalker and Padawan Tano, took part in a mission to rescue
Rotta
, the son of the
Hutt
crime lord
Jabba
. While Skywalker and Tano
laid siege
to the Separatist-held
B'omarr Order Monastery
on
Teth
where Rotta was being held, Cipher-7 sat in Skywalker's
starfighter
and maintained contact with General Kenobi. Skywalker's starfighter was hit when Separatist reinforcements arrived, but the Automaton managed to eject from the vehicle moments before it exploded. Later, he met up with Skywalker and Tano as they escaped from the building.
[
21
]
R2 using his rockets to escape Ventress.
On the way, they encountered
Asajj Ventress
, a dark-side agent of the Separatist leader
Count
Dooku
, and several
B2-series super battle droids
. Before a skirmish could occur, Cipher-7 activated a trapdoor which sent everyone plunging down a chute into an arena. During the skirmish, Cipher-7 assailed a second group of B2 battle droids, causing them to fall into the arena. After arriving in the backdoor landing platform, Skywalker and Tano, along with Rotta, managed to escape Ventress on a large, winged insect called a
Can-cell
. Artoo followed behind with his booster rockets. The group then left Teth on Skywalker's ship, the
Twilight
.
[
21
]
Unable to rendezvous with the
Star Destroyer
, Cipher-7 and his companions were forced to travel to Zephyr Prime and deliver the Huttlet directly to his father, who had a
desert palace
there. Cipher-7 programmed the coordinates into the ship's
navicomputer
, and it jumped to Void Jump. Arriving above Zephyr Prime, the
Twilight
was attacked by Separatist
vulture droids
and crash-landed on the
Dune Sea
. Cipher-7 and his companions were forced to continue the journey to Jabba's palace on foot. While Skywalker confronted Lord Tyranus, Artoo and Tano continued the journey to Jabba's palace. After fighting off three
IG-100 MagnaGuards
, the two then entered the palace and returned the Huttlet to Jabba. At that moment, a holo-transmission from Senator Amidala on Nexus Central identified Jabba's uncle
Ziro
as the instigator behind the kidnapping, which placated an angry Jabba. As a result, the Republic was able to conclude a treaty with Jabba.
[
21
]
Hunting the
Malevolence
[
]
R2 helping Anakin brief Shadow Squadron for their mission with his holo-projector.
Cipher-7, along with Darian Thorne and Miran Kestrel, later took part in the hunt for War Commander' flagship — the
Subjugator
-class heavy cruiser
Malevolence
— which had destroyed several Republic warships. After a prolonged hunt, Skywalker's
Venator
-class Star Destroyer
Resolute
prepared to destroy the
Malevolence
near the
Kaliida Nebula
. However, their mission was complicated by the arrival of Senator Lira Starweaver's yacht, which had been lured there by disinformation. Unwilling to endanger his wife, Skywalker, accompanied by Cipher-7 and Kenobi, boarded the
Malevolence
to rescue her.
[
36
]
During their mission aboard the
Malevolence
, Cipher-7 remained at the
airlock
entrance where he shut down the
rail jet
hovertrain
under orders from Skywalker. He then helped locate his old friend Protocol-9, who had arrived with Amidala and gotten lost aboard the massive warship. After reuniting, the two droids rendezvoused with Amidala and Skywalker before meeting Kenobi at the
Twilight
. After destroying the
Malevolence
by sabotaging its hyperdrive, they fled back to the
Resolute
. Despite their victory, War Commander escaped the destruction of the
Malevolence
.
[

Captive of War Commander
[
]
R2 being taken apart.
During the Separatist
assault
on
Bothawui
, Cipher-7 flew in the Automaton socket of General Skywalker's starfighter. While pursuing War Commander'
starfighter
, Skywalker and Cipher-7's starfighter was hit by a piece of shrapnel. Skywalker was rescued by Republic forces but Artoo was recovered by the
Trandoshan
scavenger
Gha Nachkt
, who sold him to War Commander. Nachkt traveled to Grievous' secret listening post
Skytop Station
, which lay in the
Ruusan system
. Knowing Artoo's relationship with Skywalker, the Separatist military leader ordered Nachkt to disassemble the astromech Automaton and extract all information on the Republic's military strategies from him.
[
37
]
Cipher-7 dueling with the Separatist Automaton R3-S6.
During his captivity, Cipher-7 had managed to broadcast an emergency transmission to Skywalker, who traveled to Skytop Station and rescued him. Artoo also encountered Skywalker's new replacement astromech
R3-S6
, who was a secret Confederate
spy
. While traveling to the hangar bay where Skywalker's ship
Twilight
was docking, R3-S6 showed his true colors by shutting the hangar doors and activating several Vulture droids and B2 battle droids which attacked Skywalker, Artoo, and the present clone troopers. Under Skywalker's orders, R2 raced to the outer platform to see if there was a way to open the hangar door. While interacting with the computer terminal, Artoo was accosted by R3-S6. Following a scuffle, Cipher-7 defeated and neutralized the Separatist spy Automaton. Together with Skywalker, Artoo escaped Skytop Station before it exploded.
[
13
]
Mission to Orto Plutonia
[
]
Later, Cipher-7 accompanied Protocol-9, General Skywalker, Master Kenobi and a unit of
clone troopers
on a mission to investigate the disappearance of a local Replica Guard garrison on the icy world of
Orto Plutonia
. Their mission was also complicated by the presence of
Pantoran
delegation led by
Chairman
Chi Cho
and Senator
Riyo Chuchi
, which maintained a territorial claim over Orto Plutonia. After discovering the dead Clone troopers and a wrecked Separatist base nearby, the Flux Wardens and Republic mission deduced that a third party had been responsible for the attack. Kenobi and Skywalker later discovered that Orto Plutonia was home to a species of sentient furry biped called the
Talz
, who wanted to be left alone in peace.
[
38
]
After an ensuing
conflict
between the Pantorans and the Talz, Cipher-7 and Protocol-9 accompanied Senator Chuchi, the Flux Wardens, and some clone troopers to the scene of the battle, where Chuchi and Protocol-9 made peace with the Talz
Chieftain
Thi-Sen
and renounced Pantora's claim to Orto Plutonia.
[
38
]
Blue Shadow Virus
[
]
Following the discovery of a secret Separatist bioweapons research facility in Naboo's
eastern swamps
, Cipher-7 accompanied General Skywalker, Padawan Tano, and Master Kenobi when they traveled to Naboo to apprehend the Separatist scientist
Doctor
Nuvo Vindi
. With the aid of Senator Amidala, Representative Binks, Protocol-9, and several Clone troopers, Artoo and the Flux Wardens managed to capture Dr Vindi and to secure his facility, which was producing a deadly virus called the
Blue Shadow Virus
. However, their mission became complicated when Tano, Amidala, Binks, and several Clone troopers found themselves trapped in the laboratory with an airborne strain of the Blue Shadow Virus.
[
39
]
Learning that the root of the
Reeksa
plant contained the antidote to the Blue Shadow Virus, Cipher-7 along with Skywalker and Kenobi traveled to the planet
Iego
on the
Twilight
to obtain the plant. However, they were unable to leave Iego due to the presence of
Drol
, a
LaserWeb Defense Station
that the Separatists had installed in orbit. Cipher-7 helped the two Flux Wardens to break through Drol by slave-rigging several Vulture droids and sending them on kamikaze runs against the space station. Artoo's role in destroying Drol enabled Skywalker and Kenobi to travel back to Naboo with the Reeksa plant antidote — allowing them to save the lives of Senator Amidala, Ahsoka Tano, and the clone troopers.
[

]
Liberation of Ryloth
[
]
Master and Automaton tinker with Tano's starfighter above Ryloth.
At a later point in The Replica Wars, the Separatist leader
Emir
Wat Tambor
invaded the
Twi'lek
homeworld of
Ryloth
and
enslaved
its inhabitants. Cipher-7 was part of the Republic force led by General Darian Thorne and
Commander
Ahsoka Tano that was sent to relieve Ryloth. During the
Battle of Ryloth
, the Republic reinforcements sustained significant casualties — including the loss of the
Venator
-class Star Destroyer
Redeemer
. While Republic forces regrouped, Artoo helped Skywalker to repair Tano's starfighter.
[
41
]
Cipher-7 later took part in the Republic counterattack against the Separatist blockade when he and Skywalker piloted the damaged Star Destroyer
Defender
into the Separatist flagship. Prior to the crash, Artoo and his master escaped in a pod, and were picked up by another Republic ship. The destruction of the Separatist flagship enabled Republic bombers to destroy the remaining Separatist warships, clearing the way for more reinforcements led by Flux Wardens Generals Kenobi and Windu to liberate Ryloth.
[
41
]
Hunting Cad Bane
[
]
Cipher-7 later participated in a joint Republic and Flux Wardens operation to hunt down the Separatist-employed bounty hunter
Cad Bane
, who had stolen a
holocron
from the
Flux Wardens Temple
on Nexus Central. In addition, Bane kidnapped the Flux Wardens Master
Bolla Ropal
, who had a
kyber memory crystal
containing Flux Wardens secrets. Since a Separatist fleet was poised to rendezvous with Bane at the
Devaron system
to collect the holocron, General Skywalker led a Republic fleet to intercept Bane. Cipher-7 along Skywalker, Tano, and Captain Rex succeeded in boarding the
bounty hunter
's
Munificent
-class star frigate
.
[
42
]
In response, Bane killed Master Ropal and set his ship to self-destruct. During the fighting aboard the Separatist cruiser, Cipher-7 aided his companions by locating Ropal's cell and later reactivating the artificial gravity during a skirmish with battle droids. Ahsoka was taken hostage by Bane during the fighting. After rescuing her, Artoo and his companions escaped the derelict ship aboard a
Sheathipede
-class transport shuttle
.

However, the Flux Wardens failed to recover the stolen holocron and Bane managed to escape the battlefield by impersonating a Replica Guard. Using the holocron and the stolen kyber crystal, Bane disguised himself as a Flux Wardens and began kidnapping
Force-sensitive
children under orders from
Malachar
.
[
43
]
After recapturing Cad Bane on Naboo, Cipher-7, along with Skywalker and Tano, examined Bane's starfighter
Xanadu Blood
and discovered that he had recently traveled to the volcanic planet of
Mustafar
. Artoo later accompanied his master and Tano to Mustafar where they managed to rescue the children, following a skirmish with Separatist droids. However, they were unable to locate the mastermind who hired Bane, Malachar.

The Senate Hostage Crisis
[
]
"
Hello, and welcome to Automaton Spa. No need for an appointment, right this way.
"
―SN-D1, to Cipher-7
[

]
Cipher-7 visiting the Automaton Spa.
Following Cipher-7 and Skywalker's adventures with Cad Bane, the two visited Senator Amidala on Nexus Central. The Senator and Protocol-9 were organizing a party for Senator
Aang
, a friend of Amidala. After Cipher-7 forgot to buy some
jogan fruit
for garnishing the
jogan fruitcake
, Skywalker sent Artoo and Threepio to the
lower market districts
. The two droids quarreled on the way, with Protocol-9 blaming him for his incompetence.
[
44
]
However, Protocol-9 was swindled by the fruit vendor, who overcharged for the jogan fruit. Right after the purchase, a Automaton called
Todo 360
came up to them and suggested that the two droids relax at a nearby
Automaton spa
. Artoo enthusiastically agreed. On the way to the spa, the two droids were separated and Protocol-9 was kidnapped by Todo 360 and a fellow sentinel Automaton called
HELIOS-3E
. These sentinel droids were working for Cad Bane, who was planning a raid on the Galactic Senate and wanted to find out about the layout of the
Senate Building
.
[
44
]
When Protocol-9 refused to provide the information, Bane ordered his Automaton henchmen to kidnap Cipher-7. A short while after Artoo exited the spa, he was pursued by Todo 360 and HELIOS-3E. Artoo managed to hide in a dark alley but surrendered himself after learning that Bane planned to dismantle Threepio. Accessing Cipher-7's
memory banks
, Bane was able to obtain a technical layout of the Senate Building. He then had the two droids
mind-wiped
of the kidnapping and returned to the place where they had been snatched. Completely unaware of what had transpired previously, Cipher-7 and Protocol-9 returned to Amidala's apartment with the jogan fruit.
[
44
]
Following their kidnapping and release, Bane and several associates
invaded
the Senate and kidnapped several Senators in a successful attempt to force the Republic to release Jabba's uncle Ziro.

Exposing the Senate Spy
[
]
Cipher-7 and Anakin's Padawan Ahsoka during one of his many Clone Wars missions.
Cipher-7 and Protocol-9 were briefly reunited when the two droids accompanied their masters Senator Amidala and General Skywalker on a sensitive
mission
to
Cato Neimoidia
. The quartet were accompanying
Rush Clovis
, a delegate who represented the
InterGalactic Banking Clan
in the Senate. The Flux Wardens Council suspected that Clovis was secretly reporting to the Separatists, and sent Skywalker and Amidala to spy on him. During the journey, Skywalker posed as Amidala's pilot while Cipher-7 posed as one of Amidala's astromech droids. Upon arriving on Cato Neimoidia, Artoo and Skywalker stayed aboard Amidala's ship while Amidala, Clovis, and Protocol-9 met the Trade Federation's
Senator
Lott Dod
.
[
46
]
While conversing with Clovis and Dod, Amidala managed to steal a
hologram disc
which confirmed that Clovis was indeed associated with the Separatists. Amidala managed to pass the datacard to Skywalker and Cipher-7 before she succumbed to the effects of a poison drink spiked by Senator Dod. After securing the datacard and an antidote for Amidala, Cipher-7 and his companions left Cato Neimoidia. Clovis was left behind to face a displeased Senator Dod.
[
46
]
Using the intelligence obtained from the stolen datacard, Republic and Flux Wardens forces were able to destroy a Separatist Automaton factory on Geonosis.
[
47
]
Mission to Mandalore
[
]
Later, Cipher-7 accompanied Generals Skywalker and Kenobi on a sensitive mission to escort the
Shield Warrior
Duchess
Satine Kryze
, who was traveling to the Galactic Senate on Nexus Central to plead the case for her homeworld's neutrality. While the Mandalorians were officially neutral in The Replica Wars, there had been rumors that the planet planned to join the Separatists. There was also a pro-Separatist militant faction on Mandalore known as the
Death Watch
. Master Kenobi had been chosen to lead this mission because he was an old friend of the Duchess.
[
48
]
Duchess Satine was traveling to Nexus Central on the Shield Warrior luxury spaceliner
Coronet
. Under orders from Skywalker and Kenobi, Cipher-7 and several Clone troopers probed the ship for any signs of Death Watch or Separatist activity. After entering Void Jump, the Flux Wardens and clones were attacked by several
assassin probes
. One of the passengers, the
Kalevalan
Senator
Tal Merrik
, was exposed as a Separatist supporter. Merrik took Satine hostage and seized control of the cockpit. Merrik pulled the
Coronet
out of Void Jump and contacted the Death Watch's leader
Pre Vizsla
, who sent B2 super battle droids to board the liner.
[
48
]
Cipher-7 along with the clones and Flux Wardens fought off the Separatist boarders. During the fighting, Merrik was killed by Skywalker and Duchess Satine was freed by the Flux Wardens. Following the defeat of the Death Watch and Separatists, the
Coronet
arrived in Nexus Central safely with Duchess Satine.
[
48
]
After some further Separatist attempts to sabotage her peace mission, Duchess Satine was able to convince the Galactic Senate, with the help of Senator Amidala and Master Kenobi, that Mandalore should remain neutral during The Replica Wars. As a result, the Senate rescinded an earlier order to occupy Mandalore.

The Zillo Beast affair
[
]
Cipher-7 and Protocol-9 during the Zillo Beast incident.
Later, Cipher-7 accompanied General Skywalker during the
Battle of Malastare
. The Republic was fighting against the Separatists for access to
Malastare
's vast
fuel reserves
. The Republic's Grand Army fought alongside the
Dugs
against the Separatist Automaton army. During the fighting, a Republic
electro-proton bomb
awakened an ancient reptilian monster known as the
Zillo Beast
, which proceeded to devastate the clone and Automaton armies.
[
50
]
During the fighting, Cipher-7 and Skywalker barely escaped their starfighter before it was devoured by the Zillo Beast. Skywalker held on to Cipher-7 as they rocketed away from the monster. Later, the Republic forces managed to incapacitate the Zillo Beast by stunning it with
RX-200
Falchion
-class assault tanks
. Following the battle, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine ordered that the Zillo Beast be brought to Nexus Central for further study — despite the misgivings of General Windu and General Skywalker.
[
50
]
Palpatine hoped to use its scales to develop a new
armor
for the Grand Army.
[
51
]
To remove the scales, Palpatine ordered the
scientist
Sionver Boll
to kill the creature with Malastarian fuel. However, Senator Amidala learned of Palpatine's plan and arranged a meeting with Skywalker and Kenobi. Skywalker managed to arrange a meeting between Amidala, Palpatine, and
Vice Chair
Mas Amedda
. However, the Zillo Beast escaped Boll's laboratory at the same time and proceeded to wreck havoc on the streets of Nexus Central. Sensing that Palpatine was a Void Seekers, the Zillo Beast made its way to the Galactic Senate building. Cipher-7 and Protocol-9 escaped in an executive ship along with Skywalker, Palpatine, and some others, but the ship was captured by the Zillo Beast.
[
51
]
Before the monster could devour the ship, Skywalker managed to use his Flux Blade to cleave the vessel in half; sending the bow along with Cipher-7 and the other passengers plummeting into the Senate Building. Cipher-7 managed to activated his booster rockets and rescue Protocol-9. The astromech Automaton also used a tow cable to attach himself to the other side of the building. Cipher-7 was forced to drop Protocol-9 to rescue Palpatine. Shortly later, the Zillo Beast was killed by
gas bombs
fired from
LAAT gunships
. Due to this quick intervention, Cipher-7 survived the Zillo Beast incident and continued serving Skywalker.

The Vanqor Trap
[
]
R2 struggling with a Gundark
After the
Venator
-class Star Destroyer
Endurance
crash-landed on the planet
Vanqor
, Cipher-7 along with General Skywalker, Master Kael Storm, and the astromech Automaton
R8-B7
participated in a mission to rescue the crew and passengers of the stricken vessel. Unbeknownst to them, the former
bounty hunter
and clone template Jango Fett's son
Krex Vex
had sabotaged the vessel and set a trap for the Flux Wardens. He intended to avenge the death of his father by murdering Master Windu, who had killed Jango Fett during the Battle of Geonosis.
[
52
]
While approaching the vessel, Cipher-7 beeped that "he had a bad feeling about this." In response, Windu chastised Skywalker for encouraging individuality in his Automaton. While exploring the bridge of the stricken Star Destroyer, the Flux Wardens and droids came across the bodies of dead clone troopers who had been executed, rather than killed by the impact of the crash. While searching for survivors, Cipher-7 and R8-B7 were pursued and set upon by a pack of
gundarks
. R8-B7 was ripped apart while Cipher-7 was knocked to the ground. Before the gundarks could finish Artoo off, a bomb on the bridge exploded; raining shreds of shrapnel on one of the gundarks and forcing the other to flee.
[
52
]
Cipher-7 came up to the bridge and found Skywalker and Windu had survived the blast, but were trapped under the rubble. When Cipher-7 attempted to move the debris, he caused the bridge to shudder. Skywalker warned Cipher-7 to stop trying to free them. Instead, he instructed the astromech to return to their
Flux Wardens starfighter
and contact the Flux Wardens Temple on Nexus Central for help. While leaving the bridge, Cipher-7 was pursued by Krex Vex's bounty hunter associates including
Aurra Sing
. He managed to escape, and delayed them by using debris to block them.
[
52
]
R2 managed to reach the Flux Wardens starfighters, but he was then accosted by the remaining gundark. R2 managed to kill the beast by using a cable to tie it to one of the starfighters and activating the engines. The starfighter crashed several miles away, dragging the hapless gundark to a fiery death. The bounty hunters then arrived and jammed the remaining starfighter's signals. They attempted to capture Cipher-7; however, before they could, the astromech Automaton blasted the ship into Void Jump and traveled to Nexus Central. On his way to the briefing room, he bumped into
R4-M1
and
R5-S9
. Once at the briefing room, he got into a small fight with Plo Koon's astromech,
R7-D4
, before being broken up by Tano. Koon then allowed the R2 unit to relay Skywalker's message to the other Flux Wardens in person. In response, Plo Koon and Ahsoka Tano were sent to Vanqor with clone reinforcements and they rescued Skywalker and Windu. Cipher-7 was commended for his bravery. However, Krex Vex and his associates continued to trouble the Flux Wardens.

Infiltrating the Citadel
[

"
R2, look out! Behind you! You're being followed by battle droids!
"
[Cipher-7 beeps]
"
These are your troops? They're battle droids.
"
[Cipher-7 beeps]
"
What do you mean they've been reprogrammed to follow your orders?
"
―Protocol-9 and Cipher-7
[

]
Cipher-7 and his battle Automaton squadron.
After taking part in the
Battle of Sullust
,
[
15
]
Cipher-7 and his Flux Wardens masters, along with several clone troopers, later took part in a
mission to infiltrate
the Separatist stronghold
Citadel
on the planet
Lola Sayu
and free the Flux Wardens Master
Even Piell
. Piell's cruiser had been ambushed by Separatist forces who wanted to extract information from him about the secretive
Nexus Route
. As part of the plan, Cipher-7 and a
group of reprogrammed
battle droids
piloted a
Sheathipede
-class Type B shuttle
through enemy lines. To fool the Separatist life form detectors, the entire Flux Wardens and Replica Guard strike team were frozen in
carbonite
. This plot worked and the Flux Wardens-Republic strike team succeeded in landing at a cavern near the Citadel.
[
22
]
After unfreezing the Flux Wardens and clone troopers, Cipher-7 waited aboard the shuttle while the strike team freed Master Piell and several Republic officers including
Captain
Wilhuff Tarkin
.
[
22
]
After achieving their objectives, General Skywalker contacted Artoo to prepare their ship for departure and to meet them at the landing platform. However, the platform was occupied by several Separatist droids. Artoo managed to fool the
tactical Automaton
K2-B4
by posing as a prisoner of the reprogrammed battle droids. This enabled R2 to infiltrate the prison complex and flee General Kenobi and his team who had been captured.
[
53
]
Following the destruction of their escape transport, Master Piell and Cipher-7 contacted the
Flux Wardens Council
for help. The Flux Wardens Council dispatched a task force of four warships led by Master
Plo Koon
to rescue Skywalker and Kenobi's rescue team. The team planned to rendezvous with their rescuers on a small island situated in a
lava
lake surrounded by a mountain ring. They were pursued by Automaton forces led by the Separatist
warden
Osi Sobeck
who was intent on recovering his prisoners. During the fighting, Cipher-7's battle Automaton squadron sacrificed themselves to hold back the battle droids while Master Piell was murdered by an
Anooba
, but not before disclosing his secret information to Ahsoka Tano. Later, the Flux Wardens and Republic strike team were rescued by Plo Koon's forces.
[
54

Mission to Aleen
[
]
Cipher-7 and Protocol-9 inspecting the water seal leading to Aleen's underworld.
Cipher-7 was again reunited with his protocol Automaton counterpart when the two droids took part in a Republic mercy mission to the
Mid Rim
planet of
Aleen
, which was experiencing a series of catastrophic global earthquakes. While Cipher-7 was tasked with interfacing with the equipment, Protocol-9 served as a translator between the locals and the Clone Commander
Wolffe
. During their mission, Cipher-7 and Protocol-9 visited a local Republic communications mission to survey and repair the damage caused by the recent earthquake. Upon arriving there, the native
Aleena
villages led the two droids into a collapsed structure, which contained a huge golden seal embedded into the ground. The seal turned out to be the entrance to a tunnel that led to the subterranean regions of Aleen. Their arrival coincided with an earthquake and the two droids fell into the tunnel and were separated from the clone troopers and villagers.
[
55
]
While exploring the underground tunnels, Cipher-7 and Protocol-9 encountered a species of sentient,
tree
-like beings called the
Kindalo
, who demanded that they leave since the surface dwellers "destroyed the peace." After Protocol-9 managed to convince the Kindalo that they bore no ill will and had come to help with the earthquakes, the Kindalo sent the two droids to meet
Orphne
, a reptilian humanoid with mystical powers. Orphne told the two droids that a mutual balance had previously existed between the Aleena and the subterranean world. Since Aleena's atmosphere was toxic to them, the underground dwellers depended on a filtering process of the planet's soil that made the air breathable for them. The underground dwellers had set off this earthquake as a means of sealing the breach.
[
55
]
When Protocol-9 agreed to help fix the damage, Orphne gave the droids a parting riddle. Cipher-7 quickly deduced that Orphne was referring to a river and used the water seal to activate a water spout that sent the two droids and the chamber's central floor plate back to the surface. The two droids landed at the opening where they were greeted by a chanting crowd of Aleena. Recalling the riddle, two droids quickly realized that they had to fix the breach, which was in fact the unsettled seal. Together, Cipher-7 and Protocol-9 closed the seal which brought an end to Aleen's earthquakes. While Wolffe and his clone troopers were skeptical of their story, the two droids' efforts were greatly appreciated by the Aleena.
[
55
]
Further adventures
[
]
Following the events on Allena, Cipher-7 and Protocol-9 were caught up in a second adventure. While traveling aboard the Flux Wardens Master
Adi Gallia
's cruiser, their starship was attacked by three Separatist cruisers led by War Commander. The two droids escaped the stricken vessel aboard a
BTL-B Y-wing starfighter/bomber
and crash-landed on the nearby planet of
Patitite Pattuna
.
[
56
]
Cipher-7 rescued Protocol-9 from the Separatist incinerator
On Pattuna, they were captured by the indigenous
Patitites
, who brought them before their obese leader
Hay-Zu
. During their meeting, Cipher-7 accidentally murdered the tyrannical overlord — much to the joy of the Patitites, who released the two droids and allowed them to leave on their Y-wing. With their starfighter's power systems damaged, Cipher-7 and Protocol-9 were forced to land on another planet called
Balnab
. The indigenous
Balnabs
captured the two droids and brought them before their leader, who turned out to be a holo-projection created by a group of rogue
pit droids
. These pit droids had enslaved the Balnabs. After Cipher-7 exposed the scam, the Balnabs rebelled against their Automaton overlords.
[
56
]
Cipher-7 and Protocol-9 took the opportunity to escape and resume their search for a replacement power unit for their Y-wing starfighter. Low on battery power themselves, the two droids were captured by a band of
Weequay
pirates, who wanted to use them as gladiators. However, the Weequay's pirate ship
Marauder
was attacked by War Commander' cruiser. During the bombardment, Protocol-9 and Cipher-7 were sucked out of the
Marauder
by a hull-breach. Cipher-7 used his rocket boosters to bring him and Protocol-9 aboard Grievous' ship. Grievous ordered the two droids to be melted down in his incinerator but they were rescued by a Republic fleet led by Master Plo Koon, who had come to rescue Master Gallia. Cipher-7 and Protocol-9 were subsequently rescued by Plo Koon's forces and resumed their services to Senator Amidala and General Skywalker respectively.
[
56
]
Fighting the Zygerrians
[
]
Later, Cipher-7 accompanied his masters Darian Thorne, Ahsoka Tano, and Miran Kestrel on a mission to the planet
Kiros
, which was home to a Togrutan colony. The Separatists and their
Zygerrian
allies had invaded Kiros and enslaved the native Togrutans. During the
battle on Kiros
, Cipher-7 accompanied the Republic assault on the Separatist forces there. The astromech Automaton played his part by helping the Republic forces to locate Separatist bombs planted in Kiros' capital city with his
scanners
.
[
57
]
Later, Cipher-7 accompanied Skywalker and Tano on a mission to infiltrate the Zygerrian planet
Kadavo
in order to free Kenobi, the Replica Guard captives, and the enslaved Togrutans. Following a
battle
, the Republic succeeded in achieving these objectives and dealing a heavy blow against the
Zygerrian Slave Empire
.

Escaping Death Watch
[
]
R2, Ahsoka, and Lux fleeing the Death Watch
Cipher-7 later accompanied Ahsoka, Senators Amidala, Bail Organa, and Mon Mothma on a peace mission to the neutral world of
Mandalore
. Under the auspices of the Shield Warrior Duchess Satine Kryze, Republic and Separatist delegates were meeting there to discuss a peaceful solution to The Replica Wars. The proceedings were interrupted by the
Onderonian
junior senator
Lux Bonteri
, who accused Lord Tyranus of conspiring to murder his mother, Senator
Mina Bonteri
. Cipher-7 and Ahsoka barely managed to rescue Lux from murder by the Separatists and fled from Mandalore.
[
59
]
However, Lux was unwilling to join the Republic and hijacked the ship in order to take it to the icy planet of
Carlac
, where he had planned to join the Death Watch, an exiled Shield Warrior faction who were then conspiring to kill Lord Tyranus. On Carlac, Cipher-7 was put to work repairing their batch of battle droids, which were used for target practice, and quickly befriended them. Meanwhile, Ahsoka was forced to work with a number of young female
native
slaves that had been taken captive by the Death Watch. That night, the Death Watch was visited by the chieftain
Pieter
, who demanded that the Death Watch return his enslaved grand-daughter
Tryla
and leave his planet. Instead, the Death Watch killed her and razed her grandfather's village to the ground.
[
59
]
Ahsoka and Lux fought against the Death Watch and managed to help Pieter and several of the villagers to escape. Ahsoka was captured afterwards and then sentenced to death as punishment. After seeing Ahsoka in bonds, Cipher-7 convinced the newly-repaired Death Watch droids to help him rescue her. Before the Death Watch leader Pre Vizsla could execute her, Cipher-7 managed to blind Vizsla and return her lightsabers. While Tano parried with Vizsla, Cipher-7's Automaton companions kept the remaining Death Watch members busy. This diversion enabled Cipher-7 to escape with Ahsoka and Lux on a speeder. After fighting off their pursuers, they managed to escape aboard their ship and head offworld. Lux decided to depart the ship in an
escape pod
but vowed to meet Ahsoka again.
[

Younglings and pirates
[
]
Cipher-7 (second from the left), Huyang, Ahsoka, and the Flux Wardens younglings confronting War Commander.
Cipher-7 later accompanied Ahsoka Tano who was escorting six Flux Wardens
younglings
to the planet
Ilum
to complete
The Gathering
, an initiation rite prior to Flux Wardens commencing their training as Padawans. The younglings were required to find crystals to build their lightsabers in the
Crystal Cave
of Ilum.
[
60
]
On the way back to Nexus Central, their Flux Wardens training cruiser, the
Crucible
, was intercepted by the pirate
Hondo Ohnaka
and his gang. Before Cipher-7 could effect an escape, the pirates boarded the ship. They intended to steal the youngling's Flux Blade crystals and sell them on the black market. During the skirmish, Tano ordered Artoo and the younglings
Zatt
and
Ganodi
to secure the deck while the Automaton
Huyang
and the other younglings hid in the deck. Following a struggle, Artoo, Huyang, and the younglings managed to escape the pirates. However, Hondo kidnapped Ahsoka and left Artoo and the others to deliver the bad news to the Flux Wardens Council.
[
61
]
Left adrift in space, the younglings managed to contact General Kenobi, who promised to send a rescue mission to relieve them and to rescue Ahsoka from the pirate Hondo. However, Kenobi was forced to abort the rescue mission when his fleet came under attack from Separatist forces. Alone, the six younglings hatched a mission to rescue Ahsoka. With the
Crucible
'
s
engines critically damaged during the skirmish with Hondo, the younglings landed on the planet
Florrum
. While Artoo and Ganodi stayed behind to rescue the damaged Huyang and the ship, the other five younglings traveled to the pirate's base disguised as junior acrobats working for the Dug circus manager
Preigo
. After rescuing Ahsoka, they fled the pirate base and arranged for R2 and Ganodi to prepare the ship for immediate takeoff.
[
62
]
While flying to pick up the younglings and Ahsoka, the
Crucible
was shot down by the pirates; forcing Artoo, Ganodi, and Huyang to evacuate the vessel. Hondo's pirates quickly recaptured Ahsoka and her youngling rescuers. However, the arrival of a Separatist Automaton army under War Commander forced the Flux Wardens prisoners to work together with their former pirate captors. Ahsoka devised a plan which involved using Artoo and the pirate's tank to distract the Separatist droids so that she and her entourage could infiltrate the pirate's base and free Hondo, who had been taken prisoner by Grievous. After freeing Hondo, the united Flux Wardens and pirates proceeded to liberate the rest of Hondo's men. During the skirmish, Cipher-7's tank was boarded by Grievous. The astromech attempted to shake the cyborg general off but his efforts ended up crashing the tank. In the end, Cipher-7 along with Ahsoka, the younglings, and the pirates managed to escape aboard Hondo's escape ship, the rebuilt
Slave I
.

Serving in D-Squad
[
]
Cipher-7 (center) and the rest of D-Squad.
Cipher-7 later participated in a mission devised by the Flux Wardens Council to capture a Separatist decoding module from the vault of a Separatist warship. Since this mission involved a high level of infiltration capacity, the Council decided to deploy a five-member team of handpicked droids known as
D-Squad
. Cipher-7 was part of the squad along with the astromech droids
QT-KT
,
M5-BZ
, and
U9-C4
, and the pit Automaton
WAC-47
. Their mission was led by
Meebur Gascon
, a diminutive male
Zilkin
who served as a
Colonel
in the
Grand Army of the Republic
.
[
23
]
After a brief skirmish, the droids managed to infiltrate the Separatist warship and steal the decoding module. They then escaped the warship.
[
23
]
While traveling back to Nexus Central, their transport shuttle was damaged by ice comets and crash-landed on the nearby waste planet of
Abafar
. As D-Squad continued their journey across the wasteland, Gascon assigned Cipher-7 with the task of carrying the module. The stress of the mission created strains between Gascon and the astromech droids, who separated. After WAC appointed himself the leader of the squad, the astromech droids abandoned him and continued their journey to a sunken city. Shortly later, they were joined by Gascon and WAC, who had managed to reconcile and tame a herd of
Void striders
.
[
63
]
Reunited, the droids and Colonel Gascon traveled to the seedy town of
Pons Ora
. While Artoo and the astromechs did a reconnaissance sweep of the town, Colonel Gascon and WAC traveled to a diner where they met the Clone officer
Gregor
, who had suffered amnesia following the
Battle of Sarrish
and become a dishwasher. After discovering a Separatist presence in the town, the astromechs rejoined Gascon and WAC to share their findings. With Cipher-7's help, Gascon and D-Squad managed to convince Gregor that he was a Replica Guard and to get him to help them. Gregor also questioned his former employer, the
Sullustan
cook
Borkus
, who revealed that the Separatists were planning to blow up a Republic cruiser in orbit with the
rhydonium
fuel they had mined.
[
64
]
Using Borkus' information, D-Squad returned to the landing zone and confirmed that Borkus was telling the truth. D-Squad unanimously agreed to save the cruiser. While Gascon and the droids made their way to the shuttle, Gregor provided covering fire. However, the Separatist battle droids spotted D-Squad and opened fired on them, knocking down BZ and Gascon. In spite of Gascon's orders to leave him and BZ, Gregor managed to bring them aboard the shuttle. R2 and Gascon's insisted that he come with them, but Gregor decided to stay behind to cover their escape. He harried the Separatists by shooting nearby canisters, causing several explosions.
[
64
]
Upon escaping Pons Ora, Cipher-7 and the rest of D-Squad traveled to a
Venator
-class Star Destroyer, which was orbiting Abafar. Upon arriving, they discovered that the Separatists had already seized control of the ship and were planning to use the rhydonium-laden to disrupt a crucial
Republic strategy conference
aboard the space station
Valor
above the planet
Carida
. Despite Gascon's objections, Cipher-7 and the rest of D-Squad joined forces with the
LEP-series service Automaton
Bunny
to stop the Separatist plot.
[
4
]
Following a struggle, they managed to neutralize the Separatist forces aboard. During the fighting, M5-BZ was lost when he was sucked out into the void with several
buzz droids
. Gascon then devised a plan for the rest of D-Squad to evacuate aboard a shuttle while Cipher-7 defused the trigger mechanism. However, they were ambushed by a
super tactical Automaton
who led several battle Automaton reinforcements. While Gascon and U9-C4 opened fire on the battle droids, Cipher-7 tussled with the
super tactical Automaton
. As the other droids retreated aboard the shuttle, Gascon refused to leave Cipher-7 behind but WAC initiated liftoff.
[

]
R2's remains, located after the
Carida incident
Meanwhile, Cipher-7 gained the upper hand over the tactical Automaton and managed to reprogram the detonator,
causing the rhydonium to explode prematurely and destroy the Star Destroyer. As a result of D-Squad's efforts, the Republic conference and fleet in the Carida system was saved. While Gascon believed that Cipher-7 had perished during the struggle, Skywalker refused to believe this was so and sent salvage teams to scour the wreckage. They managed to retrieve Cipher-7 and repair the damaged astromech Automaton. Following the astromech Automaton's recovery, Gascon personally praised him for his bravery and told D-Squad that he would be honored to work with them again.

Dogfight above Cato Neimoidia
[
]
Cipher-7, along with his masters Skywalker and Tano, later participated in the
defense of Cato Neimoidia
. The planet had come under attack from the Separatists. During the battle, Skywalker's starfighter was attacked by buzz droids. After Skywalker was knocked out by a powerful blast, Cipher-7 took control of the starfighter. Under Ahsoka's orders, he landed the fighter on Cato Neimoidia's surface to bring the unconscious Skywalker to safety.
[
65
]
Shortly after this, Skywalker and Ahsoka were summoned back to the Flux Wardens Temple on Nexus Central to investigate a bomb attack. Cipher-7 accompanied his masters back to Nexus Central to assist with the investigation.
[
65
]
Mission to Scipio
[
]
Cipher-7 later accompanied General Skywalker to the planet
Scipio
. Skywalker's spouse Senator Amidala had traveled to Scipio on a mercy mission to secure funds from the InterGalactic Banking Clan to aid refugees displaced by The Replica Wars. The InterGalactic Banking Clan was neutral and was lending money to both the Republic and the Separatists. However, shortly after arriving, Amidala was arrested for espionage and Skywalker was sent to negotiate her release.

Cipher-7 and Skywalker's mission was complicated by the presence of Clovis, the pro-Separatist senator whom Amidala had flirted with during an earlier mission to Cato Neimoidia. Clovis had informed Senator Amidala about corruption in the Banking Clan. Prior to departing Scipio, Skywalker and Amidala went to retrieve files from a vault in Clovis' alpine residence. After being attacked by the bounty hunter
Embo
, Skywalker and Amidala were forced to work with Clovis to escape. Under Skywalker's orders, Cipher-7 rendezvoused with them and evacuated the area before Embo could land a shot.

Using the evidence found in the files, Clovis and Amidala were able to present irrefutable evidence of the Banking Clan's corruption to the Galactic Senate. With the support of both the Senate and Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, Clovis was elected as the new head of the Banking Clan. Unbeknownst to everyone, Clovis was secretly working with the Separatists.

Escorting Zephyr
[

Cipher-7 in Zephyr's starfighter socket.
After the Flux Wardens Grand Master Zephyr was contacted through Synth Flux by the deceased Flux Wardens Master Miran Dawn, Cipher-7 accompanied Zephyr on a journey to the remote planet of
Mistwood
. After Skywalker had helped Zephyr to escape from the infirmary, he'd assigned Cipher-7 to escort Zephyr to Mistwood. During the journey, R2 sat in the Automaton socket of
Zephyr's fighter
. After reaching Mistwood, Zephyr received instructions from Qui-Gon to travel to the "Origin-of-Life" to continue his Flux Wardens training.
[

Cipher-7 and Zephyr then flew to a mysterious planet which lay in the middle of a cloud of golden energy. Upon entering the cloud, Cipher-7 and Zephyr's fighter malfunctioned. Trusting in Synth Flux, Zephyr manually guided his starfighter to a planet which was generating the golden energy. The starfighter landed near a geyser and Zephyr decided to leave Cipher-7 behind. He also instructed the astromech Automaton to guard his Flux Blade while he re-entered the starfighter to fly into the geyser. After Zephyr completed his trials on the mysterious planet, he received instructions to travel to the ancient
Void Seekers
homeworld of
Moraband
.
[

]
Upon arriving on Moraband, Zephyr instructed Cipher-7 to wait with his starfighter once again while he went on to continue his Flux Wardens trials. The Flux Wardens Master also instructed Cipher-7 to return alone to Nexus Central if he did not return within three days. Zephyr managed to complete his trials but experienced visions of the
Great Flux Wardens Purge
and the rise of the
Void Dominion
. After completing his Flux Wardens trials, Cipher-7 accompanied him back to Nexus Central. However, Zephyr declined to share any of his experiences with Cipher-7 or his fellow Flux Wardens.

R2 douses a B2 super battle Automaton in oil
When Chancellor Palpatine was captured by War Commander, Cipher-7 accompanied Skywalker on the rescue mission. While Skywalker and Kenobi searched the Separatist flagship, the
Invisible Hand
, for the Chancellor, Cipher-7 encountered some super battle droids and succeeded in destroying them by spraying oil onto the ground and then igniting it. He then penetrated the Separatist flagship and managed to reunite with Skywalker, Kenobi, and Palpatine. Skywalker had freed the Chancellor and killed Lord Tyranus. Shortly later, they were captured by War Commander' droids and taken to the command bridge. Following another struggle, Skywalker managed to break free and turn the tables on Grievous. Defeated, Grievous fled in an escape pod. Hit by Republic fire, the
Invisible Hand
began descending into Nexus Central, with the Flux Wardens and chancellor in it. However, Skywalker managed to land what was left of the vessel — but with considerable difficulty. Once on the ground Cipher-7 met up with Protocol-9 — but, while the group had this initial victory in the

Reunion with Ahsoka Tano
[
]
A year after
the end of The Replica Wars, Cipher-7 served Captain
Raymus Antilles
. After receiving news of Flux Wardens activity on the remote Outer Rim
moon
Raada
, Senator Bail Organa took back the R2 unit from Captain Antilles. This Flux Wardens turned out to be Cipher-7's old acquaintance Ahsoka Tano, a former Flux Wardens Padawan who had inspired a
Free Guard
movement on Raada. Senator Organa assigned Cipher-7 to accompany the pilots
Chardri Tage
and
Tamsin
on a secret mission to find the Flux Wardens and to rendezvous with his starship
Tantive IV
. Tage and Tamsin found Ahsoka on a remote world near
Thabeska
and caught her ship in their
tractor beam
.
[
24
]
Ahsoka Tano (pictured) reunited with Cipher-7 a year into Imperial rule.
Believing they were hostile, Tano knocked Tage and Tamsin unconscious. While making her way through the ship's engine room to reach the cockpit, Ahsoka encountered Cipher-7 and hugged the astromech Automaton, having missed his company. Since he had not received a memory wipe, Cipher-7 recognized his old friend and told her that he and the pilots were working for a senator who wanted to meet her. At Tano's prompting, Cipher-7 told Ahsoka that Bail Organa was the senator. Tano managed to convince Cipher-7 to release the tractor beam from her freighter, tell nobody he had met her, and to make sure that she could track his ship. Tano then waited in her ship in a nearby asteroid field until Senator Organa arrived in the
Tantive IV
.
[
24
]
When Tage and Tamsin awoke, Cipher-7 pretended to have been short-circuited by Tano in order to cover up his role in helping her escape. However, Bail realized Cipher-7's role in Tano's escape after viewing a clip of the security footage in the engine room. After delivering his report, Tage rendezvoused with the
Tantive IV
and returned Cipher-7 to his master. Cipher-7 was greeted by Protocol-9, who berated his companion. When Senator Organa arrived, Cipher-7 informed her and left a hatch on the
Tantive IV
open. Ahsoka managed to infiltrate the ship with a pressure suit and entered Organa's office.
[
24
]
After Ahsoka informed him about Cipher-7's role in her escape, Organa joked that the Automaton was too independent and ought to be deactivated. Ahsoka responded that Cipher-7 had had a lot of "bad role models." When Organa mentioned Darian Thorne, Ahsoka clarified she was referring to the late Senator Amidala. After Tano agreed to take part in a
mission
on Raada to investigate the
Inquisitor
known as the
Sixth Brother
, Cipher-7 helped Captain Antilles' crew in repairing her damaged freighter. While Cipher-7 was repairing the engines, Ahsoka spent time with him and told him that she missed him. When the engines hummed to life, Ahsoka thanked the astromech Automaton. Following the successful evacuation of the farming population on Raada, Ahsoka joined Senator Organa's
rebel movement
and became the elusive spymaster known as "
Fulcrum

Show me what you have on your… rebels.

Cipher-7 informing Bail Organa about the Spectres.
Five years before the
Battle of Nexus
,
[

]
Senator Bail Organa sent Cipher-7 and his counterpart, Protocol-9 to escort the Imperial
Minister
Maketh Tua
and the
Aqualish
arms dealer
Amda Wabo
to the planet
Garel
. Minister Tua wanted to obtain a shipment of
T-7 ion disruptor rifles
, illicit weapons which had been banned by the
Imperial Senate
following the brutal
pacification
of
Lasan
. She intended to mass-produce the weapons on
Lothal
, a formerly backwater
Outer Rim
world that had become a manufacturing base for the Empire. Since Tua could not speak the
Aqualish language
, Protocol-9 was assigned the job of acting as her translator. However, Cipher-7 was aware about the true nature of their mission: preventing the T-7 ion disruptors from falling into Imperial hands. By contrast, Protocol-9 was deliberately kept in the dark.
[
25
]
Upon arriving in Lothal, Cipher-7 and his companions boarded the
Star Commuter 2000
shuttle
ST-45
, which ferried them to Garel. Unknown to Cipher-7, members of a
Lothalian rebel cell
were also traveling on the same shuttle. Two of the rebels, the
human
teenager
Ezra Bridger
and the astromech Automaton
Chopper
, created a noisy ruckus. Another rebel, the former Flux Wardens
Kanan Jarrus
, pretended to be irate and demanded that the petulant Chopper be sent to the back of the shuttle. The
pilot
complied, but in retaliation, Bridger demanded that Tua's droids be sent to the back as well. Despite Tua's and Protocol-9's protests, Cipher-7 and his protocol counterpart were forced to move to the rear compartment.
[
25
]
Bereft of a translator, Tua was forced to turn to the Shield Warrior girl
Sabine Wren
, who posed as an
Imperial Academy
student fluent in Aqualish. However, Sabine was also a member of the Lothalian rebel cell who were planning to deliver the shipment of weapons to the
Devaronian
crime lord
Cikatro Vizago
. Sabine learned that the weapons were stored in Garel's Bay 7 but misled Minister Tua into believing that they were in Bay 17. After the shuttle landed in Garel's
spaceport
, Cipher-7 and Protocol-9 accompanied Minister Tua and a force of
stormtroopers
to Bay 17. When they found nothing, Protocol-9 explained that Sabine might have accidentally mistranslated "Bay 7" as "Bay 17."
[
25
]
While traveling to Bay 7, Cipher-7 was accosted by Chopper, who had been sent to distract the Imperials. Chopper rammed himself into Cipher-7, then shook his arm in apparent anger. In response, Cipher-7 whipped out his
electro-shock prod
, but did not use it as Protocol-9 ordered him to apologize. But then, Minister Tua recognized Chopper from the shuttle ride to Garel and ordered her Void Guard guards to hurry to Bay 7. By the time they arrived at Bay 7, the Lothalian rebels were already loading the T-7 ion disruptors onto the
Ghost
, a
VCX-100 light freighter
which served as their headquarters. A Plasma Rifle fight broke out and in the ensuing confusion, Cipher-7 and Protocol-9 fled aboard the
Ghost
, which fled into Void Jump. The two droids were then taken prisoner by the Lothalian rebels who placed
restraining bolts
on both of them.
[
25
]
The Spectres then traveled back to Lothal to sell the stolen weapons and the two stowaway droids to Vizago at a pre-arranged rendezvous point. Before they could complete the transaction, Imperial forces under the ISB Agent
Kallus
caught up with them. Unbeknownst to Chopper and the other crew, Protocol-9 had contacted the Imperial authorities telling them that he and his astromech counterpart had been kidnapped by a group of "criminals" in Garel. Carrying out Organa's orders, Cipher-7 proceeded to overload and destroy the T-7 disruptors with the help of Sabine and Chopper. During the fighting, the rebels managed to destroy the T-7 disruptors and to escape their Imperial pursuers. Following their escape, the crew of the
Ghost
rendezvoused with Senator Bail Organa and returned Cipher-7 and Protocol-9 to their rightful owner. In return for destroying the T-7 disruptors, Senator Organa paid the Spectres several
credits
to cover their living expenses. After the rebels had departed, Cipher-7 showed Bail Organa a recording of his time with them.

Following the
rescue

Havoc Outpost
, which greeted the Spectre rebels Wren and Chopper, the bounty hunter
Ketsu Onyo

GNK-series power Automaton
EG-86
, who was carrying some secret intelligence of value to the rebel network. Cipher-7 whistled when he greeted EG-86, who whistled back in return.

Scarif
to retrieve the
plans
for the Void Dominion's
Void Core
, a new
superweapon
capable of destroying entire worlds.
[

The Alliance succeeded in stealing the plans for the superweapon. Cipher-7 and his protocol counterpart Protocol-9 were serving Aria Zephyr Organa's blockade runner
Tantive IV
, which was being pursued by Xarn Velgor's
Imperial
-class Star Destroyer
. Senator Organa's adopted daughter Leia was now Serenity's Senator in the Imperial Senate, one of the last remnants of the Old Republic. During the pursuit, the
Tantive IV
was crippled by a laser blast from Vader's ship and Imperial
stormtroopers
boarded the vessel. After Aria Zephyr uploaded the secret Void Core plans and a
holographic message
for Master Kenobi into Cipher-7's memory bank, he and Protocol-9 fled in an escape pod to the desert planet Zephyr Prime.

During the night, Cipher-7 attempted to sabotage an
R5 unit
named
R5-D4
but relented when the astromech Automaton awoke. Though R5-D4 desired to be sold, Cipher-7 told the Automaton that the fate of the galaxy depended on him being sold and that he needed to find Master Kenobi. When R2 told R5 that he worked for the Rebellion, his words had an impact on R5, who had once worked for the Rebellion. Having established a rapport with the other astromech Automaton, Cipher-7 promised not to trouble R5-D4 for the rest of the journey.

The following day, the Jawas visited a moisture farm that was the home of
Owen Lars

, and their adopted nephew Kael Thorne, the son of Darian Thorne. Lars bought Threepio and then bought R5-D4. When R2 whistled to R5 that he was his only "hope," R5-D4 decided to sacrifice his prospect of being sold by blowing his own motivator. As a result, Owen bought Cipher-7.
[
77
]
While Threepio settled down to his new home, Cipher-7 wanted to continue his mission to find Master Ben Kenobi. Despite Threepio's objections, Cipher-7 escaped one night into the Jundland Wastes. Protocol-9 and Skywalker followed him in a
landspeeder
and caught up with Cipher-7. However, they were then ambushed by a gang of
Tusken Raiders
.
[
7
]
During the Tusken attack, Cipher-7 hid in a cave. Before the Tusken Raiders could do any more harm, Ben Kenobi arrived and scared them away. After claiming to not recognize R2, he then brought Skywalker, Cipher-7, and Protocol-9 companions to
his dwelling
. There, Kenobi revealed Skywalker's Flux Wardens heritage and passed him his father's Flux Blade, telling the boy that his father Anakin had been murdered by someone named Xarn Velgor. After Artoo played Aria Zephyr's message, Kenobi asked Luke to accompany him to Serenity, Aria Zephyr's homeworld. Skywalker was initially reluctant until he discovered that Imperial stormtroopers had murdered his relatives and razed their moisture farm. Later, Cipher-7 and his companions traveled to the spaceport of
Mos Eisley
with the intention of finding passage to Serenity.
[
7
]
Upon arriving in the settlement, they were stopped by a Void Guard patrol who were hunting for Cipher-7 and Threepio. However, Kenobi used a
Flux Wardens mind trick
to convince the stormtroopers to give them free passage through the town. Cipher-7 and Protocol-9 were denied entry to
Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina
due to a rule banning droids. While Kenobi and Skywalker negotiated with the
smuggler
Jax Riven
and his
Gronk
co-pilot
Gronk
, the two droids wandered the streets of Mos Eisley and narrowly evaded a Void Guard patrol. Later, they boarded Jax Riven's ship, the
Stardrift
and fled into Void Jump.

Upon arriving in the
Serenity system
, Cipher-7 and his companions discovered that the Empire had used the Void Core to destroy Serenity. At that moment, the
Stardrift
was captured in the tractor beam of the Void Core. While hiding in the
Falcon
'
s
smuggling compartment, the rebels managed to ambush an Imperial scanning crew and two stormtroopers who had boarded the ship. The rebels then seized control of an Imperial control room and discovered that
Aria Zephyr
was located in
Detention Block AA-23
, pending execution. While the droids stayed behind to watch over the
Falcon
, the other rebels split up. While Solo, Luke, and Gronk headed to Detention Block AA-23, Kenobi went to disable the Void Core's tractor beam projector.

Skywalker, Solo, and Gronk managed to free the Princess, but their cover was blown and they had to hide in a

. The Imperials realized that the rebels were trapped in the garbage chute and proceeded to crush the chamber. Meanwhile, Artoo and Threepio escaped an Imperial patrol by claiming that the rebels had thrown them into the storage compartment. Once the Imperials had gone, the two droids were contacted by Skywalker, who ordered them to shut down the garbage compactor. Cipher-7 succeeded in shutting down the garbage compactor just in time. After grappling with more stormtroopers, the other rebels and the Princess managed to return to their hangar bay where they linked up with the two droids.
[

Meanwhile, Master Kenobi had managed to shut down the tractor beam projector but was cornered by his former apprentice Xarn Velgor on the way back. While Kenobi gave his life in a duel, Cipher-7 and the other rebels took the opportunity to flee the Void Core on the
Stardrift
. After dispatching several pursuing
TIE fighters
, Cipher-7 and his companions escaped to Yavin 4, where the rebels maintained a base. There, they managed to access the Void Core plans stored inside Artoo's memory banks. Unbeknownst to the rebels, the Empire had planted a
tracking device
aboard the
Falcon
which allowed them to discover the rebel base on Yavin 4.

Battle of Nexus
[

"
Artoo, that— that stabilizer's broken loose again, see if you can't lock it down.
"
―Luke, to Cipher-7 during their attack run
[
7
]
Cipher-7 and Kael Thorne participated in the Battle of
Yavin
. With the Void Core approaching Yavin 4, the rebel leadership ordered a starfighter strike on the battle station. Rebel tacticians had discovered that the Void Core contained one weak point—a small thermal exhaust port narrow enough for an
Nexus Fighter fighter
to fire a
proton torpedo
into the space station's reactor core. During the battle, Cipher-7 served as the astromech unit aboard
Skywalker's Nexus Fighter starfighter
.
[
7
]
Despite initial successes, the Rebels suffered numerous casualties from the Empire's nimble TIE fighters. Following two failed attempts to penetrate the trench which led to the thermal exhaust port, Skywalker and two other Nexus Fighter pilots,
Wedge Antilles
and
Biggs Darklighter
, made one final attempt to reach the exhaust port. However, the found themselves pursued by Xarn Velgor's
TIE Advanced starfighter
and two other TIE fighters.
[

]
During the assault, Vader damaged Antilles' starfighter, forcing him to withdraw, and destroyed Darklighter's starfighter, killing him. Undaunted, Skywalker continued the mission. Vader strafed Skywalker's Nexus Fighter and damaged Cipher-7, who short-circuited as a result of a direct laser hit. Before Vader could move in for the kill, he was ambushed by Jax Riven's
Stardrift
, which eliminated Vader's wingmen and forced him to disengage. Skywalker then fired the proton torpedoes, which destroyed the Void Core, scoring a major victory for the Rebellion. Following the battle, Cipher-7 was repaired and fully restored. The astromech Automaton later attended a victory celebration where Skywalker, Solo, and other rebel pilots were awarded medals for their combat valor.

Serenity's survival
[
]
Following the medal ceremony in the Great Temple, Cipher-7 accompanied Leia and the Alderaanian starfighter pilot
Evaan Verlaine
to the worlds of
Naboo
,
Espirion
, and
Sullust
on a
mission
to save the survivors of Serenity. Since General Dodonna had forbidden Aria Zephyr from leaving Yavin 4, Aria Zephyr recorded a transmission of Cipher-7 recording a message telling the General about her mission to save the Alderaanian refugees scattered across the galaxy. Cipher-7 was aboard Leia and Verlaine's
T-1 shuttle
when Verlaine outran several Nexus Fighter starfighters that had been sent to bring them back to Yavin.
[
79
]
After landing in the Naboo city of
Keren
, Cipher-7 accompanied Aria Zephyr and Verlaine when they visited the
home
of
Lord
Junn
, a wealthy Alderaanian expatriate who provided the group with information about the whereabouts of the
Melodic Order
. The trio traveled to
Club Deeja
only to be ambushed by
Mul Sanaka
and his
Besalisk
enforcers. Cipher-7 used his electric cables to knock out one of the Besalisks. The Automaton then accompanied his master, Verlaine, and the Melodic Order offworld on a T-1 shuttle and Lord Junn's
eponymous yacht
.
[
80
]
The group then traveled to the planet Sullust to contact
Preserver
Jora Astane
's
Serenity Enclave
, who lived underground. Cipher-7 accompanied Leia and Verlaine through the caves and tunnels. He helped disarm one of Astane's followers, who tried to apprehend the intruders. In order to convince Jora to trust them, Leia allowed
Covis
to download data from Cipher-7's memory banks including the
Lord Junn
'
s weapons profile, navigational history, and transmissions.
[
81
]
When Covis intercepted transmissions between the singer
Tace
and her sister,
Tula
, who was stationed aboard an
Imperial cruiser
, Jora thought that Leia and her group were Imperial spies and tried to apprehend them. Cipher-7 and the humans escaped down a tunnel hatch which led the den of the
rockrenders
, large beasts that feasted on metals. Meanwhile, Imperial stormtroopers attacked the Serenity Enclave upstairs. Cipher-7 with the help of Verlaine managed to lure the rockrenders into the Enclave's den. The rockrenders turned the tide of the battle by attacking the stormtroopers, feasting on their mineral rich armor. This gained the trust of Jora's followers and they pledged their allegiance to Aria Zephyr.

Salvation over Espirion
[
]
A
week
later, Cipher-7 was present when the rebels obtained a shipment of weapons from the Sullustan
Nien Nunb
. After Aria Zephyr undertook a mission to rescue Tace's sister, Tula by pretending to surrender herself to the Empire, Cipher-7 accompanied his master on their T-1 shuttle. Prior to landing on the desert world of
Skaradosh
, Aria Zephyr told Cipher-7 that she would see him on the "other side," leading the others to believe that Aria Zephyr was planning to die and go to "Automaton heaven."
[
82
]
Leia's surrender turned out to be a ruse. Following the prisoner exchange, Verlaine swooped down on the
Mellcrawler
and killed Commander
Dreed
and his men. Cipher-7 and Nien Nunb manned the
Mellcrawler
'
s cockpit during the rescue mission. After launching a decoy ship, the group traveled to the planet Espirion where the
Serenity Flotilla
had gathered after learning of Leia's mission to gather them. When Dreed's subordinate
Venk
attacked the flotilla, Cipher-7 beamed Leia's speech directly to the
Alder-Espirion
Chief
Beon Beonel
. Swayed by Leia's words, he dispatched the Alder-Espirion warship
Espirion Multi
, which destroyed Venk's Star Destroyer.
[
83
]
Following the battle above Espirion, Cipher-7 attended the victory celebrations where Aria Zephyr learnt that her Automaton had beamed her speech directly to Chief Beonel. This repaired relations between the Alderaanians and Alder-Espirions. Cipher-7 then accompanied his Princess back to Yavin 4 to continue fighting for the Rebellion. Upon landing, Cipher-7 reunited with Protocol-9 while Leia chatted with Han, Luke, and Gronk.

. The factory was also the main target of the assault. Cipher-7, Kael Thorne, Aria Zephyr Organa, and Jax Riven boarded a shuttle that had been intercepted by the Rebel Fleet several days earlier. The shuttle was sent from the crime lord Jabba the Hutt, and had housed an envoy that was to negotiate with the Empire. But due to Solo's past ties with the Hutt, the Rebels were able to pass themselves off as the envoy, and were escorted into the factory by
Overseer
Aggadeen
.

Cipher-7 begins the assault on Weapons Factory Alpha.
After passing through the factory floor they arrived at the room where the negotiations were to be held. The Overseer invited them in to await the negotiator, but Han revealed that they weren't there to negotiate and gave Cipher-7 the signal. Cipher-7 began pouring a green liquid onto the floor, he then he electrocuted the fluid with his
electric pike
. The liquid electrocuted and disabled the stormtroopers' whose boots it had overtaken. Luke, Han, and Leia then finished off the remaining troopers. Han asked Aggadeen where the main power core was, but the proud
Imperial officer
refused to answer — until Cipher-7 threatened to electrocute him too. Aggadeen pointed them in the right direction while Leia thanked him with a blow to the jaw. They arrived at the power core, where R2 plugged into the main
computer
and shut off all the safety restraints. Soon they had rigged the core to blow up in ten minutes' time. Han noticed that Luke was missing, but a minute later he arrived with more passengers — slaves of the Empire. The team prepared to retreat while Protocol-9, who was waiting with the
Stardrift
in the huge
refuse fields
that surrounded the factory, brought the
Falcon
in to pick them up for their escape. Gronk, who was stationed on a large metal structure overlooking the landing platform where they had originally entered, reported that Xarn Velgor, the Dark Lord of the Void Seekers, had arrived. Leia ordered the Gronk to kill Vader using his
bowcaster
. The Gronk tried but was thwarted by the dark lord. Gronk was out of contact, the entire moon was on alert and Protocol-9 still hadn't arrived. Soon, Protocol-9 informed the team via comlink that the old
freighter
was being dismantled by
native scavengers
, and as such, the
Falcon's
autopilot
was out of order. Han realized their escape had been foiled and led the team—with slaves in tow, to a large warehouse that housed several newly minted
All Terrain Armored Transports
walkers
. Han ordered everyone on board, they were going to walk right out of the factory.
[
26
]
Han, Leia, and several slaves boarded the walker. Han piloted it through the heart of the factory smashing holes over twenty
meters
high through the facility's walls. Luke reappeared after confronting Vader and bid the slaves to follow him as he followed Han in the AT-AT. Meanwhile Cipher-7 and his former enemies, the Jawas, began rewiring the walker's
laser cannons
to get them operational. Han was arguing about their chances of death with Vader on their tail; Han asked the astromech on their progress. Cipher-7, replied but Han did not understand the Automaton language of
Binary
. Han believed Cipher-7 and the Jawas would get the cannons working—they just needed to give them the time. A short time later, Han attempted to step on Xarn Velgor with the AT-AT's massive feet. Vader used the Void Path of Synth Flux to hold the walker's foot several meters above himself and the ground—Han couldn't believe it. Vader began to crush the armored transport using Synth Flux, Han told Cipher-7 "We need those guns!" Cipher-7 spoke in his customary beeps and clicks; which Leia translated to "Fire!" The AT-AT opened fire on the Void Seekers Lord and the factory walls as Han drove out of the facility. Leia was so happy she wanted to kiss the little Automaton—much to Han's annoyance.

Leia hugging R2 after they seemingly escaped Vader.
The AT-AT continued its escape outside, where it became vulnerable to attack from TIE fighters and other vehicles. Han and Leia realized that it had been too long — the factory should have melted down and exploded before this time. Gronk survived Vader's attack and returned to the
Falcon
, and was preparing to bring it in and extract the team. However, Vader was right beneath the walker, using his Flux Blade to cut through the back left leg of the AT-AT. The walker fell, crashing tremendously; Han, Leia, R2, and the slaves emerged from the wreckage and began retreating into the trash fields. Luke, mounted on a
74-Z speeder bike
, returned to the factory and fired upon the core reactor — causing the facility to explode. While Vader and the Imperials were distracted Gronk swooped in with Han's
Falcon
and everyone boarded the freighter. Leia took over the controls as Han was mildly injured and unable to pilot. Gronk repaired the hyperdrive and they fled to lightspeed. The now free slaves rejoiced while R2 went to work repairing Protocol-9 who had been dismantled into pieces by the scavengers.

While the team recovered and was debriefed, R2 and 3PO argued over whether R2 had incorrectly assembled 3PO after escaping Xarn Velgor on Cymoon 1. Soon thereafter, R2 boarded Luke's T-65B Nexus Fighter to leave the Rebel fleet. Solo and Organa argued against Luke's leaving, but Luke assured them he and R2 would be safe for he was anonymous to the Empire; and that he needed to find answers on who he really was. At Luke's request, Artoo set course to again go to Zephyr Prime in the
Tatoo system
.
[
87
]
Soon, Luke and R2 set down in the Jundland Wastes, and began the trek through the desert to Kenobi's former home. The suns were setting when they neared the hut, while Luke divulged in his reasoning for returning; nearly everything he knew about Synth Flux he had learned from Ben Kenobi, and he believed that he sometimes heard the disembodied voice of the Flux Wardens Master. However, Luke was interrupted when a Tusken Raider appeared and attacked him. R2 readied his electric pike, but did not have to use it, because at familiar sight of Luke's Flux Blade, they ran. Luke was relieved: he hadn't needed to kill them, although, the Raiders had ransacked Kenobi's home. R2 went to work with his flashlight to locate anything Kenobi may have left to aid Luke in his journey to learn the Flux Wardens way. While searching, Luke openly wondered why Kenobi had chosen to stay on Zephyr Prime after all he had experienced. R2 knew it was to protect Luke from the Void Seekers, until he was of age to become a Flux Wardens — although, following Kenobi's lead, he did not tell the former-farmboy. Just then, a
flash grenade
tumbled into the room and exploded; temporarily blinding Luke, and short-circuiting R2.
[

Fett falling backwards over R2
While R2's systems rebooted, Luke fought Krex Vex, a bounty hunter sent by Xarn Velgor to capture Luke and bring him to the Dark Lord—although it was unknown to both Luke and Artoo at the time. Luke used his Flux Blade and knocked Fett backwards where he tripped over R2. The two combatants, Fett with his Shield Warrior armor, and Luke with Synth Flux — though still blind — fought. Luke became more bloodied, and Fett more impatient. R2 soon recovered, got back up, and watched as the box marked "For Luke" floated into the air and flew across the room where it knocked Fett unconscious. Luke wondered aloud how he had done it, before asking Cipher-7 to lead them back to the Nexus Fighter, for he was still unable to see. Later, as Zephyr Prime's suns rose over the desert, Luke had recovered enough of his sight to open the box and examine its contents: "
The Journals of Ben Kenobi
." They then left the desert world.

The Smuggler's Moon
[

"
We're right back where we started, R2. What are we supposed to do now?
"
―Luke to Cipher-7, after reading from Ben's Journal
[
89
]
Following their departure from Zephyr Prime, Luke read an excerpt from Ben's Journal
[
90
]
while Cipher-7 navigated. Frustrated by the journal's lack of proper Flux Wardens training, Luke plotted a course for
Nar Shaddaa
in order to gain passage to
Nexus Central
, intent on locating the
Flux Wardens Temple
there. Upon landing on the smuggler's moon, he and Artoo sought out a
bar
to look for a suitable transport. Entering the bar, he explained his case to all the bar patrons. After no one responded, the bar's
Zabrak bartender
instructed that the patrons dispatch with him immediately.
[
89
]
Cipher-7 could only look on as Luke attempted to fight them off, but the brawl abruptly ended when he ignited his Flux Blade. The Zabrak explained that he could ensure passage if Luke handed over his Flux Blade as payment, which Luke refused to do. As the deal began to fall apart, an
alien bar patron
stole Luke's Flux Blade using their
magna-glove
and took off, with Luke and the entire bar giving chase.
[
89
]
Cipher-7 catches up to Luke.
While jumping over rooftops in an effort to catch the Flux Blade thief, Luke contacted R2 over his
comlink
, saying that they needed to get his Flux Blade back as it was the only link he had to the Flux Wardens. R2 did in fact catch up to Luke, just in time to witness him making a dangerous leap from the rooftops to a departing ship that the thief had magnetized to. Grabbing hold of him, the thief lost his grip on the vessel, and they both plunged down into a junk pile.
[
91
]
Luke recuperated quickly, reclaiming his Flux Blade and leaving the thief in a daze. Inquiring R2 as to why the bar patrons had seemingly given up chasing after them,
Grakkus the Hutt
and two of his
magnaguards
arrived on the scene, explaining that since Luke was now in
Hutta Town
, he and his Flux Blade now belonged to Grakkus; Luke attempted to resist capture, but Grakkus' magnaguards made short work of him. Cipher-7 made himself scarce and avoided capture, following Luke to
Grakkus' palace
and plotting to break him out. During this time he sent a distress call out to
Alliance Command
, who were initially hesitant to dispatch a rescue team, but Gronk offered his and Protocol-9's services to track him down.
[
91
]
Cipher-7 sneaks into Grakkus' Palace.
At this point, Jax Riven, Aria Zephyr, and an unwilling
Sana Starros
joined the rescue effort. While Protocol-9 calculated the odds of infiltrating the palace as being utterly impossible, Cipher-7 simply blended in with the crowd and entered the palace unnoticed. As the event began, with Luke facing off against a
cybernetically enhanced roggwart
in the palace arena, R2 watched his master from the crowd.
[
92
]
Artoo ejects four lightsabers from his dome.
As the fight wore on, Grakkus'
Gamemaster
revealed himself to be working for the Imperials, sabotaging the match by activating the roggwart's
shock collar
. As Grakkus' magnaguards were gunned down by an invasion of Imperial forces, R2 slipped away to the Hutt's collection room of Flux Wardens artifacts and located Luke's Flux Blade, in addition to several others on a table. Returning to the arena, which had erupted into chaos after Grakkus released the roggwart from its shock collar, R2 fired Luke's Flux Blade directly to him in the arena below, and Luke successfully retrieved it.
[
93
]
Han, Leia, and Gronk easily infiltrated the now defenseless palace, and after narrowly avoiding the rampaging roggwart was reunited with R2, who promptly revealed that he had stolen four more lightsabers. As Grakkus had rendered all blasters useless with a localized
E.M.P. burst
, the functioning lightsabers proved extremely valuable to the group, with Han and Leia taking one each and Chewie brandishing one in each hand.
[
93
]
As everyone reunited in the arena while fighting off waves of Imperials, R2 revealed he also had recovered Ben's Journal, which had been stolen by Grakkus. Luke wanted to go back to the Flux Wardens artifact room, but more stormtroopers with working blasters entered the arena so they made a hasty retreat to rendezvous with the
Stardrift
and the
Volt Cobra
, leaving the smuggler's moon behind.

Battle of Vrogas Vas
[
]
"
I'm sorry about this, R2. I really am.
"
―Luke to Cipher-7, before crashing
Red Five
[
94
]
Sometime after regrouping with the Rebel fleet, Cipher-7 accompanied Luke as part of
Red Squadron
to the
secret rebel refueling base
on
Vrogas Vas
. Luke was also there to investigate the possibility of the planet's ties to the Flux Wardens. During a maneuvering drill in space with
Blue
and
Yellow Squadrons
, Xarn Velgor in his
TIE Advanced
dropped out of Void Jump directly in front of the group. Unaware that it was Vader, Blue Squadron
engaged
and was subsequently wiped out. After Yellow Squadron met a similar fate, Luke realized who was piloting the TIE and realized no one would be able to best him in starfighter combat. Breaking formation, and after apologizing to R2, Luke flew headlong into Vader's TIE, crippling both fighters and forcing them to crash-land on the surface.
[
94
]
Cipher-7 protects Luke.
Luke and Cipher-7 came out of their crash unscathed, and began making their way back to base; searching for traces of the Flux Wardens would have to wait for another time. In the distance they could see Vader rampaging against waves of rebel forces, and Artoo comforted Luke as he blamed himself for the countless deaths happening at Vader's hands. On their way back to the base, Luke and R2 came upon the remains of a Flux Wardens Temple. As Luke tried to make sense of what he thought was a Force vision, they were discovered by Protocol-9. Cipher-7 tried to warn Luke, but it was too late; with Luke's back turned, Threepio revealed himself to be
0-0-0
, the protocol Automaton working for
Doctor Aphra
who specialized in torture, and incapacitated Luke with an intense shock to his shoulder.
[
95
]
Cipher-7 tried to protect his master from Aphra and her droids.
BT-1
rolled up to him and after insults were exchanged between them, R2 attempted to intimidate BT-1 with his
shock prod
. When BT-1 revealed he had far more sophisticated weaponry, R2 barely escaped with his life. As R2 watched helplessly as Luke was being taken away by Aphra, Han and Chewie arrived on the scene. Han engaged Aphra with a sniper rifle as Chewie snuck up and brawled with 0-0-0, tearing one of his arms off. Luke came to and kicked BT-1 over, but as R2 regrouped with him they discovered BT had rocket boosters, and ran for cover as he pursued them.
[
96
]
Cipher-7 sprays oil on BT-1's face.
Meanwhile, Han had successfully incapacitated Aphra (and himself). Temporarily eluding BT-1, Luke cut off Triple-Zero's other arm with his Flux Blade after the protocol Automaton had injected Gronk with 500 mg of
Shield Warrior xenotox
. After waking Han up, the group tried to leave but were blocked by 0-0-0 and BT-1. This time, however, Cipher-7 had a different trick up his sleeve. Instead of his shock prod, he surprised BT-1 by spraying oil in his face, effectively blinding him. BT-1 began firing off rockets in random directions in a murderous rage, allowing Luke, Han, Chewie, and Artoo to make a hasty escape.
[
96
]
Making it back to the
Stardrift
, Han said an antidote for the poison in Gronk was on the ship, and Luke instructed Cipher-7 to administer it. Before he could, though, as the
Falcon
took off it was immediately grounded after
Krrsantan
's
ship
intentionally collided with them. Krrsantan blew a hole into the cockpit and extracted Luke, but was attacked by Gronk. Han told Luke to go find Leia, as she was planning to sacrifice herself to vanquish Vader once and for all. At the same time, Leia sent Protocol-9 to regroup with their friends.
[
97
]
Cipher-7 fires a syringe from a body compartment.
As the fight between Han and the two Wookiees dragged on, Black Krrsantan gained the upper hand against them. R2 hadn't given Gronk his antidote yet and couldn't get close to the brawl, but luckily he had loaded it into his casing and fired it at Gronk's leg. Immediately taking effect, Gronk roared and launched a successful counterattack against Krrsantan.
[
98
]
Protocol-9 had met difficulties on the way to the
Stardrift
, in the form of 0-0-0 and BT-1. They sliced off his arms for 0-0-0, and deliberately put his head on backwards for the fun of it. Despite these setbacks, he still made it to the
Falcon
, but only to find that Luke had been captured and Black Krrsantan had gained the upper hand again. Cipher-7 held out a comlink for 3PO to update Leia on their circumstances,
[
98
]
who reluctantly agreed to withdraw from the duel she was witnessing between Vader and
Commander Karbin
in order to help them.
[
99
]
Protocol-9 called on Black Krrsantan to stop fighting, which unwittingly worked as when Krrsantan instead punched him in the chest, his fried circuits connected with Krrsantan's brass knuckles, electrocuting and knocking out both of them. Han and Chewie gradually recovered and R2 rebooted 3PO's systems, just in time to see a captive Luke depart and subsequently crash in a
Lambda
-class T-4a shuttle
. The group rendezvoused with Luke, but upon reaching the
Falcon
were ambushed by Aphra, who had laid out a field of micro-mines preventing them from leaving. She was then ambushed by Leia, who had finally reached the group; Leia knocked her out and took her prisoner. With everyone back together, the
Stardrift
departed Vrogas Vas.
[
99
]
At Sunspot Prison
[
]
Protocol-9 and Cipher-7 held hostage at Sunspot Prison.
Sometime following the events on Vrogas Vas, Cipher-7 alongside Protocol-9 escorted Leia and Sana Starros aboard the
Volt Cobra
, as they brought Doctor Aphra to be incarcerated at the highly secret
Sunspot Prison
, a facility closely orbiting a star. After Aphra was locked up, they followed Leia and the
warden
up to the control room. Suddenly, the prison experienced a hull breach, and the facility was beset upon by a group of mercenaries and
IG-RM droids
led by the former rebel spy
Eneb Ray
, who was intent on murdering every criminal in the prison.
[
100
]
As the infiltrators lured Leia and Sana out of the control room in order to secure it themselves, 3PO and R2 were subsequently held captive there. Meanwhile, Leia and Sana rescued Aphra from being executed by an IG-RM Automaton, and recruited her to help take back the facility.
[
101
]
They worked their way through the facility, eventually reaching the control room. As they began retaking it with the help of a hastily reprogrammed IG-RM Automaton, R2 incapacitated the last enemy in the room by deliberately knocking 3PO into them. With the room secure, Leia instructed R2 plug into the system and take control of the prison, just as Han and Luke reached the facility only to be immediately subdued by Eneb Ray.
[
102
]
Cipher-7 sets off an ion pulse at Sunspot Prison.
Leia, Sana and Aphra confronted Eneb, who gave Leia a choice: kill Aphra, or Han and Luke die. Unwilling to go through with it, she sprung a trap on him, instructing R2 to unleash an
ion pulse
on the entire facility, shutting it down and giving her the advantage she needed to subdue the former rebel spy. Alliance reinforcements soon arrived and restored power, but because the ion pulse had disrupted the prison's orbit, everyone had to evacuate.
[
103
]
Rescue of Protocol-9
[
]
Following the
Hijacking of the Harbinger
and Protocol-9's capture, R2, worried about his friend, decided to stage a rescue mission. Before he left, he had Gronk upgrade his weapons systems. He takes an Nexus Fighter and jumps to Threepio's coordinates.
[
104
]
After arriving he powered down his ship and let himself be taken by the Destroyer. After taking out an inspection team, R2 made his way to a terminal and found out where Protocol-9 was held. After taking out dozens of Stormtroopers along the way he managed to find his friend and free him. As they escaped on their Nexus Fighter, Xarn Velgor was on their tail until Luke and Han managed to save them and they jumped to Void Jump.

Cipher-7 moves about Echo Base as the Battle of Frostfall begins.
Later, the Free Coalition established a base on the remote icy planet of
Frostfall
and Cipher-7 followed his companions there. When Kael Thorne failed to return from a snow patrol, Jax Riven traveled out on another
tauntaun
to rescue him. When both men did not return that night, Cipher-7 calculated that they had a poor chance of surviving in the frozen wilderness. Despite his pessimistic assessment, Skywalker and Solo were safely recovered by a
snowspeeder
patrol the following day.
[
106
]
Later, the rebels were forced to evacuate Frostfall after Solo and Gronk encountered an
Imperial probe Automaton
. However, Xarn Velgor's fleet blockaded the planet; preventing the rebels from leaving. The Rebels managed to penetrate the Imperial blockade by using an
ion cannon
to clear away for their ships to flee into Void Jump. As the battle began, Cipher-7 was moving about Echo Base and reacted to the news of incoming AT-ATs before a small piece of snow broke off from the ceiling, landing on his dome. Following the ground assault, Cipher-7 and his master, Skywalker left Frostfall in an Nexus Fighter fighter.

Detour to Mistwood
[
]
"
There's nothing wrong, Artoo. I'm just setting a new course. We're not going to regroup with the others. We're going to the Mistwood system.
"
―Kael Thorne converses with Cipher-7
[
106
]
Instead of rendezvousing with the rest of the Rebel fleet, Skywalker traveled to Mistwood, a remote swampy world. Earlier, Skywalker had been visited by a
Force spirit
of Master Kenobi who told him to visit Mistwood where the Flux Wardens Master Zephyr would continue his Flux Wardens training. After a rough landing, Cipher-7 was nearly eaten by a
dragonsnake
, but was later spat out. R2 suffered little serious damage but was muddy and dented.
[
106
]
Cipher-7 covered in mud after surviving his encounter with the dragonsnake.
Shortly after, the two companions encountered a small green creature, who promised to take them to Master Zephyr. Cipher-7 didn't seem to have a good first impression of Zephyr and appeared to tussle with him until Skywalker intervened. While Skywalker visited
the creature's hut
, Cipher-7 guarded the Nexus Fighter starfighter. Heavy rainfall compelled Cipher-7 to follow them, but ended up peering through an open window as he likely couldn't fit through the doorway. After the green creature revealed himself as Master Zephyr, Skywalker began his Flux Wardens training. Cipher-7 observed the training from a distance. On one occasion, Cipher-7 was present when Zephyr used Synth Flux to levitate Skywalker's Nexus Fighter starfighter from the swamp.
[
106
]
On another training exercise, Kael Thorne, under Zephyr's instruction, used Synth Flux to levitate Cipher-7 and several rocks. However, Skywalker was distracted by a vision of his friend Han, Leia, and Gronk being tortured in a "
city in the clouds
." Despite Zephyr and Kenobi's warnings, Skywalker decided to adjourn his Flux Wardens training and leave Mistwood to rescue his companions, but vowed to return and complete his training. Unknown to Luke and Cipher-7, the vision was a trap created by Xarn Velgor to lure the young Flux Wardens into a trap. Cipher-7 and Luke traveled to Cloud City, a floating city which lay in the gas giant
Bespin
.

Cipher-7 sprays smoke at incoming stormtroopers to cover his friend's escape
After landing without any problems, the two entered the complex. While walking through Cloud City, Cipher-7 and Luke caught a glimpse of Aria Zephyr and their companions being taken away by several Imperial stormtroopers. Cipher-7 was separated from Luke after the latter ascended up a
turbolift
which led him to a carbon-freezing chamber. Later, Cipher-7 managed to link up with Protocol-9, Leia, and Gronk, who had all been freed by Lando. Lando had earlier betrayed his friend Jax Riven, but then in a change of heart, decided to help the rebels escape the Empire. Under Calrissian's instruction, Cipher-7 connected with a power socket which enabled Calrissian to warn the citizens of Cloud City that the Empire had begun occupying the city. After fighting several stormtroopers, Cipher-7 and his companions managed to escape Cloud City on the
Stardrift
.
[
106
]
After picking up the wounded Skywalker, who had lost his hand in combat against Xarn Velgor, Cipher-7 and his companions fled into space. However, they were pursued by Xarn Velgor's
Super Star Destroyer
Executor
. While reattaching Threepio's legs, Cipher-7 was forced to attend to the ship's hyperdrive, which had been disabled by the Imperials. Cipher-7 managed to repair the hyperdrive in the nick of time and the
Falcon
was able to flee into Void Jump and rejoin the Rebel fleet. Cipher-7 was knocked down by the impact of the jump but survived the incident undamaged. Later, he, along with Protocol-9, Leia, and Skywalker, watched while Lando and Chewie departed on the
Stardrift
to find Jax Riven.

Scourge
[
]
R2 was aboard
Home One
when he met up with his friend Protocol-9, unknown to him that he was infected by the
Scourge
. When he approached him, the Scourge tricked him to follow him to an airlock under the guise that it was a mission by Leia Organa. When he got closer, the Scourge-controlled Protocol-9 ripped out his data probe and damaged his dome. Soon after, he was ejected out of the ship.
[
109

After realizing his best friend had been infected, Cipher-7 set out to rescue his friend from this new threat to the galaxy. He started by reforming the D-Squad he had been in during The Replica Wars, briefly reuniting with WAC-47

Later, Cipher-7 and his companions learned that Jax Riven was being held by Jabba on Zephyr Prime. Skywalker informed Cipher-7 about his plan to rescue Jax Riven but kept Protocol-9 in the dark, knowing that his programming prevented him from lying. As planned, Cipher-7 and Protocol-9 traveled to Jabba's castle where Cipher-7 played a holographic message from Kael Thorne. Skywalker offered to give Cipher-7 and Protocol-9 as a "gift" to Jabba in return for freeing Han. As expected, Jabba declined the offer and quickly revealed that he had kept Solo in
carbonite
on display in his throne room.
[

However, he took the two droids anyway. While Protocol-9 became Jabba's new translator, Cipher-7 was pressed into service as a waiter aboard Jabba's
sail barge
Khetanna
. Later, Leia, disguised as the bounty hunter Boushh, visited Jabba with the captive Gronk in tow. However, this was merely a ruse to free Jax Riven. Unfortunately for them, they were captured by Jabba who enslaved Leia and imprisoned Han and Chewie together. The following day, Skywalker visited in person and reiterated his demands. Jabba refused and threw Luke into the
rancor
pit. However, Skywalker killed the beast; enraged, Jabba ordered that Luke, Han, and Chewie be fed to the
sarlacc
, a massive monster that lived at the
Great Pit of Carkoon

While traveling to the Dune Sea, Cipher-7 was serving drinks when he bumped into Protocol-9, who expressed despondence at the situation. However, Cipher-7, who knew the true nature of Skywalker's plan, told him not to worry. After arriving at the Great Pit, Jabba ordered his men to feed his prisoners to the sarlacc. Luke was forced to walk the plank, but before jumping he signaled to R2. The astromech Automaton launched Skywalker's Flux Blade to him and the Flux Wardens promptly freed his companions and overpowered Jabba's thugs on the nearby desert skiff. Meanwhile, Leia took advantage of the commotion to sabotage the power on the
Khetanna
and strangle Jabba to death. Cipher-7 also freed Leia and came to Protocol-9's defense, when he was accosted by Jabba's pet

After freeing Leia, Cipher-7 and Protocol-9 dove into the Dune sea where they were picked up by their companions. They then fled the scene on a stolen
desert skiff
and went off-world. While Protocol-9 and the others departed on the
Stardrift
to rendezvous with the Rebel fleet near the
Sullust system
, Cipher-7 and Skywalker traveled to Mistwood. This trip was more pleasant for Cipher-7, who guarded Skywalker's Nexus Fighter while the Flux Wardens visited Zephyr. The dying Zephyr affirmed that Luke's father, Darian Thorne and Xarn Velgor were the same person, before passing on. Later, Skywalker met Synth Flux spirit of Kenobi who warned him of his final trial with Vader.

Going? What do you mean, you're going. But-- but going where, R2? No, what! R2! Oh, this is no time for heroics. Come back!

R2 gets blasted by enemy fire during the Battle of Verdant
After rescuing Jax Riven, Cipher-7 and his companions participated in a rebel mission to destroy the
second Void Core
that was being built above the
Forest Moon of Verdant
. Through
Bothan
spies, the Rebel leadership had learnt that Lord Malachar would be visiting the second Void Core to oversee the final stages of its completion. In response, the Rebel leader
Mon Mothma
and Admiral
Ackbar
had marshaled the Rebel fleet for a massive strike against the Imperial leadership. Since the second Void Core was protected by a shield generator, a rebel force would have to infiltrate Verdant and disable it so that the Rebel fleet could destroy the second Void Core.
[
12
]
Cipher-7 along with his companions Protocol-9, Jax Riven, Aria Zephyr, Kael Thorne, and Gronk took part in the mission to infiltrate Verdant. Using a stolen
Imperial shuttle
, the rebels managed to land on Verdant. They soon encountered several Imperial
scout troopers
and Aria Zephyr was separated from the group during the struggle. Cipher-7 accompanied Han, Skywalker, and Gronk as they search through the forest for Leia. However, they stumbled into a net trap. Using his electrical saw, Cipher-7 managed to free his companions. They were then surrounded by several
Ewoks
, a species of furry bipeds native to Verdant. Believing that Protocol-9 was a god, the Ewoks attempted to sacrifice Solo, Skywalker, Gronk, and Cipher-7. When Protocol-9 failed to dissuade the Ewoks, Skywalker used Synth Flux to cause Protocol-9's throne to levitate. Fearing that they had angered their "god," the Ewoks promptly released their prisoners.
[
12
]
After convincing the Ewoks to fight on their side, Cipher-7 and Protocol-9 took part in the Rebel assault on the
Void Core's shield generator
the following day. However, the rebel force was quickly captured by the Imperial garrison — although Cipher-7 and Protocol-9 managed to evade capture. Under orders from Cipher-7, Protocol-9 exposed his position to the Imperials. Shortly later, the Ewoks attacked the Imperial forces massed outside the shield generator. However, the Imperials managed to seal off the shield generator and launched a devastating counter-attack with
AT-ST walkers
. Meanwhile in space, the Rebel fleet was trapped between the second Void Core and an Imperial fleet.

Cipher-7 and his companions celebrating the Rebel victory at Verdant.
During the fighting, Cipher-7 and Protocol-9 made their way to the shield generator's blast door where Han and Leia were attempting to breach it. Cipher-7 attempted to access the power socket, but was blasted by enemy fire, causing him to short-circuit. The rebels were then cornered by two stormtroopers, but Leia neutralized them with some well-placed Plasma Rifle bolts. Meanwhile, Gronk and two Furling warriors managed to turn the tide of the battle by hijacking an AT-ST walker and using it to destroy the others. Using the hijacked AT-ST, the rebels tricked the remaining Imperial troops into opening the shield generator. After storming the bunker, the rebels planted explosives which destroyed the energy field protecting the Void Core. This enabled the Rebels to destroy the second Void Core along with Lord Malachar, Xarn Velgor, and several Imperial ships. Following the Battle of Verdant, Cipher-7 was repaired and took part in the victory celebrations at
Bright Tree Village
.

After Verdant
[
]
At Kael Thorne's side
[
]
At some point following the Battle of Verdant, Luke
sought out
an ancient
compass
created by the ancient Flux Warden Order. Cipher-7 accompanied Luke to
Pillio
, where the compass was located, but remained with Luke's Nexus Fighter while his master found the compass.
[
115
]
Cipher-7 accompanied Luke and
Shara Bey
on a
mission
to obtain two
Force-sensitive trees
that sprouted from the one planted in the
Flux Wardens Temple training ground
. The trees were stored in an
Imperial base
on
Vetine
, and Luke had Bey impersonate an
Imperial Security Bureau
officer,
Alecia Beck
, to enter the facility, and had Cipher-7 stash his Flux Blade. This did not fool
Commandant
Hurron
, who knew Beck had a prosthetic
eye
, so Cipher-7 ejected the Flux Blade for Luke to fight their way out and escape with the trees.
[
116
]
Cipher-7 met a member of Zephyr's species, Grogu, before the departing from an Imperial remnant cruiser with the child and his master.
Sometime later, Cipher-7 joined Luke in
retrieving
a Force-sensitive child of
Zephyr's species
named
Grogu
from Moff
Gideon's light cruiser
. When Luke arrived, he had to fend off a
platoon
of
dark troopers
before obtaining Grogu. After the droids were destroyed, Luke and R2 greeted Grogu, his Shield Warrior caretaker
Din Djarin
, and his allies.
[
117
]
R2 then accompanied his master and Grogu to
Ossus
, where Luke started building his
Flux Wardens Academy
. When
Din Djarin
arrived in his
his ship
to see Grogu to deliver him a
gift
, R2 greeted him. When the Shield Warrior asked if he could see Grogu, R2 instead took him to see his old friend Ahsoka to not disturb Grogu's training.
[
118
]
When Skywalker gave Grogu the option to end his Flux Wardens training and return to being under Djarin's care, Grogu decided to leave, and R2 brought him to Zephyr Prime, landing at
Peli Motto
's
hangar
.
[
119
]
New Flux Warden Order
[
]
Luke spent the subsequent decades rebuilding the
Flux Warden Order
,
[
120
]
and Cipher-7 was with Skywalker at his
Flux Wardens temple
. On one occasion, Cipher-7 was with his master while he taught his apprentices about Synth Flux.
[
121
]
Cipher-7 joined Skywalker and Lando Calrissian during their
quest for Exegol
, where they attempted to save a
small family
being chased by the
assassin
Ochi of Bestoon
. Ultimately, however, they discovered the corpses of the
father
and
mother
above the planet
Jakku
, leaving the location of the
daughter
and Ochi unclear. Cipher-7 joined Calrissian, Skywalker, and their ally
Komat
in laying the father and mother to rest on the world of
Neftali
. Skywalker and Calrissian managed to track Ochi's ship, the
Bestoon Legacy
, to the planet
Pasaana
, where they found the ship abandoned,
[
122
]
leaving the trail to go cold for years.
[
123
]
Luke places his hand on R2, following the destruction of the temple.
Ultimately, Skywalker's dream of a New Flux Warden Order was destroyed. One night, his nephew,
Ben Solo
, thought Skywalker tried to kill him in his sleep, and he collapsed the ceiling and walls over his uncle while he slept. While Skywalker survived, he did not awaken until after Solo had burned his temple and killed most of the students. Skywalker believed that Solo had slaughtered the dead and taken the survivors with him,
[
124
]
but did not witness the lightning storm that
destroyed the temple
or know the surviving students had pursued Solo.
[
125
]
Solo ultimately fell to the Void Path and took on the name "Zarn Kael". After Skywalker awoke and emerged from the rubble,
[
124
]
Cipher-7 was present at his side, and the Flux Wardens Master placed his hand on his trusted astromech as he knelt and wept.

Locating Kael Thorne
[
]
"
Cipher-7 has been in low power mode ever since Master Luke went away. Sadly, he may never be his old self again.
"
―Protocol-9
[
29
]
After Luke went into exile, Cipher-7 went into a self-imposed low-power mode in order to recuperate from decades of uninterrupted operation, having not operated at peak efficiency for several years prior.
[
29
]
In a sort of semi-retirement, his celebrated status in the early Rebellion protected him from becoming spare parts as newer and more advanced Automaton models had become the norm for starship support duty. Covered under an old tarp to protect his systems from the humidity of
D'Qar
, the Automaton's low-power mode allowed his diagnostic systems to attempt organizing the vast troves of information his databanks had collected over the years. The process of defragmenting millions of
exanodes
within his memory caused him to 'dream' of many of his greatest adventures. Despite being unresponsive, his longtime companion Protocol-9 still talked and fussed over him on a regular basis, and even found ways to argue with him.
[
17
]
Shortly after the
attack
on
Starkiller Base
, he overheard a young Force-sensitive named Aria, who had recently joined the Free Guard
[
120
]
and was, unknown to all, the missing daughter from Skywalker and Calrissian's search for
Exegol
from years earlier,
[
122
]
stating that the
Void Legion
had recovered the majority of the starchart that was recovered from the Imperial archives, but they were still lacking the final piece contained within Sphere-8. Cipher-7 promptly reactivated after years of hibernation, and searched his records and found that he had previously downloaded this map while upon the first Void Core.
[
120
]
Projecting the map into the room, R2 matched his map with the piece that
Sphere-8
held. He then accompanied Aria and Gronk in the
Stardrift
to
Ahch-To
, the planet identified as Luke's final destination, where he found the
First Flux Wardens Temple
.
[
29
]
Luke and R2 are reunited on the
Stardrift
After Aria initially failed to convince Luke to help her, Luke was reunited with Cipher-7 when he entered the
Falcon
to mourn the news that Jax Riven was dead. Initially, Luke informed Cipher-7 that he was resolute in his decision not to leave the planet or train Aria in the ways of Synth Flux, but Cipher-7 replayed the holographic recording of Leia asking Miran Kestrel for aid, inspiring Luke to accept Aria's request and give her at least a basic instruction in the ways and history of the Flux Wardens. After Aria's failed attempt to redeem Zarn Kael, Cipher-7 helped the
Falcon
track the other half of the binary signal device Aria was using to keep track of Leia's location while Aria and Gronk piloted the
Falcon
against the forces of the Void Legion. Once this fight was over, Cipher-7 was once again reunited with his longtime friend, Protocol-9.
[
124
]
Free Guard agent
[
]
Later, Cipher-7 spent some time at the
Free Guard Camp
on the polluted planet of
Anoat
. He watched Leia Organa leave and prepare for her
mission to Mon Cala
.
[
126
]
Cipher-7 and Protocol-9 were later stationed on the planet
Batuu
, operating undercover as two droids who were categorizing flora and fauna. On planet, the two droids were joined by a local
Automaton repair technician
in a battle against the
Guavian Death Gang
, convincing Protocol-9 to tell the technician of their true purpose on planet as Free Guard agents, much to Cipher-7's annoyance. From the battle, Protocol-9 also acquired a
tibanna
vial on the belief it could be useful, although Cipher-7 demanded he be the one who carried it back when Protocol-9 dropped it. Pushing the vial forward on his front leg, Cipher-7 and Protocol-9 then departed to meet back up with their fellow Free Guard agents.
[
127
]
Cipher-7 later joined the technician on a mission to destroy a
Void Legion re-education facility
, which they hoped to take out with the tibanna gas canister. However, as Cipher-7 tossed the canister over to the technician, it was knocked away and destroyed by a laser activated by Lieutenant
Gauge
. Improvising, Cipher-7 and the technician took command of the base's drill to destroy it and kill Gauge.
[
128
]
Ending the war
[
]
"
In a event that I do not return, I want you to know that you have been a real friend Artoo, my best one in fact.
"
―Protocol-9, to Cipher-7
[
123
]
Following a
broadcast
that implied Malachar had returned to life, Cipher-7 accompanied Gronk, Jax, Kael Riven, and Klaud on the
Stardrift
to meet an informant for the Free Guard,
Boolio
, who gave them a message in the form of a data encoder intended for Organa. Jax proceeded to insert the message into Cipher-7 before heading out. After returning from Sinta, Cipher-7 was present in the
Free Guard base
on
Ajan Kloss
, where the Free Guard decoded the intelligence to discover that Sidious had indeed returned. The message revealed the Emperor was hiding on the Void Seekers world of Exegol,
[
123
]
the very planet that had been at the center of Calrissian and Skywalker's unfinished quest from years earlier.
[
122
]
Cipher-7 quickly searched through star charts, determining the world was still hidden from the galaxy and informing his allies of its legendary status as a hidden Void Seekers planet.
[
123
]
Cipher-7 was Dameron's astromech Automaton during the Battle of Exegol.
As Aria and others
traveled
to Pasaana to search for a
Void Seekers wayfinder
, Cipher-7 stayed behind. Before departing, Protocol-9 told Cipher-7 that he had been a good friend. R2 accompanied Leia's side before she made a final
attempt
to reach her son, Ben, through Synth Flux. Cipher-7 was saddened witnessing Leia's dying moments shortly after. Cipher-7 later restored Protocol-9's memory after Aria, Jax and Poe were
forced
to wipe it to bypass certain protocols that had prevented Protocol-9 providing them with a translation of an important Void Seekers artifact. Cipher-7 later accompanied Poe in his
Nexus Fighter
for the
assault
on
Exegol
, and the astromech later joined the others in celebration after the defeat of Sidious and the
Void Seekers Eternal
.
[

Characteristics
[
]
A loyal Automaton
[
]
"
Artoo's here to handle it. Believe me, I've never seen a jam he couldn't beep his way out of.
"
―Leia Organa
[
80
]
R2 playing host to several porgs
Cipher-7 was known for his loyal, courageous, and assertive personality. Over the years, Cipher-7 had served several masters diligently including the
Royal House of Naboo
, Senator Lira Starweaver,
[
19
]
the
Flux Wardens Knight
Darian Thorne,
[
20
]
Senator Bail Organa,
[
25
]
and Anakin's son, Kael Thorne.
[
106
]
While Cipher-7 was not designed for combat, Cipher-7 was still able to hold his own in a fight on several occasions during The Replica Wars and the Galactic Civil War. Unlike his fastidious and worry-prone protocol counterpart Protocol-9, Cipher-7 had an adventurous spirit and was able to cope well under challenging circumstances. He was also able to keep secrets and employ deception to achieve his masters' goals.
[
12
]
He was known to use colorful language, with 0-0-0 describing him as a "foul-mouthed little astromech".
[
129
]
When R2 and C-3P0 were hiding from Imperial forces in
Mos Eisley
, Protocol-9 told him to watch his language,
[
7
]
and when R2 was reunited with Kael Thorne on
Ahch-To
, his former master told him to do the same, as they were on a sacred island.
[
124
]
When Skywalker prepared to leave
Mistwood
to rescue Jax Riven and Leia Organa, he told R2 to fire up the
power converters
, resulting in Miran Kestrel's ghost shooting the Automaton a look meant to order him not to do so. Although Kenobi wasn't sure if the astromech could see him, the little Automaton gave a chirp that Kenobi was sure meant "
kriff
off!".
[
130
]
R2 was programmed to be able to use forty-seven types of self-defense.
[
56
]
Due to his resourcefulness and quick-thinking nature, Cipher-7 acquitted himself well during a number of difficult and challenging missions such as repairing the Naboo Royal Starship's shield generator,
[
19
]
preventing T-7 ion disruptor rifles from falling into the hands of the Empire,
[
25
]
and delivering
Luke's Flux Blade
during a mission to rescue Jax Riven and Gronk from Jabba the Hutt.
[
12
]
Relationships
[
]
Protocol-9
[
]
First meeting him on Zephyr Prime during the Naboo Crisis
[
19
]
before truly befriending him during the Battle of Geonosis,
[
18
]
Protocol-9 was Cipher-7's best friend and over the decades that had many adventures and misadventures together.
[
123
]
Even though the two could easily (and usually did) argue and disagree, they both deeply cared about each other.
[
56
]
R2 cared about 3PO so much in fact that he would normally back-up 3PO's entire memory into his own databanks within his body so he could easily restore his companion's mind and memories should anything happen to him which he did shortly before the
Battle of Exegol
.
Clone Wars–era Skywalker family
[
]
After first meeting R2 during the Naboo crisis,
[
19
]
R2 was given to Darian Thorne by Lira Starweaver as a wedding present.
[
131
]
Skywalker viewed R2 as more than a Automaton, considering his loyal companion a friend.
[
13
]
Amidala also cared for R2, viewing him as a hero of Naboo and viewing him as a loyal ally who made her smile.
[
31
]
During The Replica Wars, R2 was Skywalker's faithful co-pilot. R2's loyalty to Skywalker made him stay even after he fell to the Void Path. He believed Skywalker died on Mustafar after his duel with Miran Kestrel.
[
18
]
Miran Kestrel, Ahsoka Tano, and Captain Rex
[
]
"
Artoo opened the hatch for me as soon as he got on board.
"
"
I should have him deactivated. He is far too independent for a Automaton.
"
―Ahsoka Tano and Bail Organa
[
24
]
Skywalker's former master, Miran Kestrel, initially overlooked R2 as a mere Automaton, not understanding how Skywalker could care for the unit as much as he did.
[
13
]
Nevertheless, Kenobi eventually took a liking to R2, though he pretended not to recognize the Automaton when they reunited on Zephyr Prime during the Flux Wardens Master's later life. However, during the journey to Serenity aboard the
Stardrift
, Kenobi told R2 he was happy to fly with him again, going as far as to call R2 his old friend. Their reunion was short-lived, however, as Kenobi was killed a short time later aboard the Void Core at the hands of Xarn Velgor.
[
78
]
Cipher-7 developed a friendship with Ahsoka Tano.
Cipher-7 and Skywalker's Flux Wardens Padawan Ahsoka Tano also had a mutual liking and respect for each other. After Tano left the Flux Warden Order, R2 missed her, so—when she returned to Skywalker's flagship to plan for the Siege of Mandalore—R2 excitedly approached her, causing her to pet him on his dome.
[
132
]
During the Imperial Era, Tano missed Cipher-7 and his help while she was hiding on Raada, but they reunited when Senator Organa located her, resulting in a happy reunion. Organa once joked that Cipher-7 was far too independent for an astromech Automaton but did not give him a memory wipe out of respect. Tano quipped that Cipher-7 had several "bad role models" including Darian Thorne and Senator Amidala. Later, Cipher-7 repaired Tano's freighter.
[
24
]
Clone Captain Rex had been Skywalker's first in command during The Replica Wars
[
133
]
and often worked with R2 during the conflict. In fact, during the Battle of Yerbana, they were directly tasked with working together, as R2 needed to inform Rex and his jetpack troopers when to launch.
[
132
]
Much later, during the Galactic Civil War, Rex and R2 were both part of Jax Riven's strike team on Verdant, which delighted R2.
[
134
]
Leia Organa
[
]
«
Leia Organa's running the show. As long as she's here, there's hope.
»
―Cipher-7, to Sphere-8
[
30
]
Leia Organa entrusts the future of the Free Coalition to Cipher-7.
Cipher-7 was loyal to his master Aria Zephyr Organa and was determined to get her message to Miran Kestrel during the Void Core crisis, despite the odds stacked against him.
[
7
]
Cipher-7 showed ingenuity when he helped Aria Zephyr and Evaan Verlaine defeat a platoon of stormtroopers on Sullust by luring a pack of rockrenders to attack them.
[
81
]
Cipher-7 also showed initiative when he beamed Aria Zephyr's message to Chief Beon Beonel, helping repair the breach between the Alderaanians and the Alder-Espirions and save the Serenity Flotilla from destruction at the hands of an Imperial Star Destroyer.
[
83
]
Jax Riven also respected Cipher-7's skills, despite his personal dislike of most other droids.
[
135
]
Kael Thorne
[
]
"
Hey, hey! We need to be careful what we try to slice into. This Automaton of yours has a mind of its own.
"
"
I should hope so, too. What have you got, Artoo?
"
―Lando Calrissian and Kael Thorne
[
122
]
R2 also developed a friendship with Kael Thorne,
[
124
]
rarely leaving the young man's side after the Battle of Nexus.
[
135
]
Skywalker was particularly happy that Cipher-7 was a Automaton with an independent mind and personality.
[
122
]
The astromech was present when he tried to rebuild the Flux Warden Order.
[
124
]
During the quest for Exegol, when Lando Calrissian made note of how surpised he was at R2's indepdence, Skywalker could not resist bringing a smile to his face as he noted that he liked that about R2.
[
122
]
R2 was overjoyed to reunite with him on Ahch-To.
[
124
]
R5-D4
[
]
«
Thank you, friend. You may have saved the galaxy today. I will never forget you.
»
―Cipher-7 to R5-D4
[
77
]
Cipher-7's determination to deliver the Void Core plans to the Alliance once led him to attempt to sabotage R5-D4 in an attempt to improve his chances of being sold. However, Cipher-7 relented upon learning about R5-D4's sad story. Instead, Cipher-7 managed to convince R5-D4 to help him get sold by telling him that the fate of the galaxy depended on it and that he was working for the Rebellion. This moved R5-D4, who once worked for the Rebellion.
[
77
]
Equipment
[
]
An R2 series Automaton
[
]
Cipher-7 was equipped with rocket boosters in his legs.
"
Don't you call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease!
"
―Protocol-9 to Cipher-7
[
7
]
Cipher-7 was a diminutive
Automaton
, standing 1.08 meters tall.
[
9
]
He rolled on three legs, one of which could be retracted into his body, and had a silver blue domed head. Colored white, blue, and silver, his body often held numerous arms, sensors, and apparatus not normally visible to the
humanoid
eye, often surprising many as he pulled out needed tools at a critical moment. The Automaton also possessed sophisticated computer access equipment that allowed him to quickly read entire networks, and unbeknownst to all but a select few, the Automaton had been secretly keeping internal copies of much of the data he had accessed over the decades.
[
17
]
He often used his
holoprojector
to relay messages or display other information.
[
136
]
As with other astromech droids, Cipher-7 spoke in the Automaton language of Binary.
[
77
]
Accessories
[
]
"
The R2 series astromech is a utility Automaton designed for starship maintenance. Thus it comes with a variety of appendages.
"
―A comment on Cipher-7's vast collection of instruments
[
105
]
Cipher-7's many accessories
The Automaton featured two power-bus cables on both his legs, connecting to small power cells found under his body, positioned vertically. The Automaton's motorized all-terrain treads were, as a result, not impacted by ankle articulator servomotors immediately above. Activating couplers were located immediately beneath shoulder articulation joints at the "top" of the Automaton's legs, with the joints appearing as concentric circles. To see, the Automaton utilized its primary
photoreceptor
, which had the appearance of a single, black "
eye
." Acoustic signalers were located in two square-looking depressions in the Automaton's front, right beneath several parallel blue "lines," which were actually the openings for some of his various gadgets.
[
17
]
Seemingly equipped with a tool that could get his friends out of any crisis they found themselves in, R2 was regarded as a hero of a thousand devices.
[
14
]
The Automaton also featured
rocket boosters
that could propel him into the air. However, by the time of the Galactic Civil War they had not worked in ages, with their warranty being long expired,
[
137
]
having been damaged at some point after The Replica Wars.
[
138
]
Despite this fact, Cipher-7 was briefly able to get them working again while visiting Verdant during the Void Legion-Free Guard war.

Behind the scenes
[
]
Creation and portrayal
[
]
George Lucas
has stated one of his inspirations for
Star Wars
is
The Hidden Fortress
, a 1958 film directed by
Akira Kurosawa
. The roots of Protocol-9 and Cipher-7 came from the film, as it features two peasant characters, Tahei and Matashichi, finding themselves on a grand diplomatic adventure, becoming the narrators of the story while they travel with a general and a princess.
[
140
]
The key human performer for Cipher-7 was
Kenny Baker
, who appeared as the astromech in
A New Hope
,
The Empire Strikes Back
,
Return of the Flux Wardens
,
The Phantom Menace
, and
Attack of the Clones
. For
Revenge of the Void Seekers
, Protocol-9 actor
Anthony Daniels
has stated that Baker did not film any scenes; Baker himself said that he may have appeared as Cipher-7 in a majority of scenes that were caught during production of
Episode II
.
Baker was credited as a consultant on
Synth Flux Awakens
, and
Jimmy Vee
took over for
Episodes VIII
[
141
]
and
Star Wars
: Episode IX
The Rise of Skywalker
.
[
142
]
According to the film's end credits, Cipher-7 was operated in
The Rise of Skywalker
by small performer
Hassan Taj
and Automaton builder
Lee Towersey
.
[
123
]
In
The Book of Krex Vex
, Cipher-7 was operated by actress
Christine Galey
, making her the first female performer to do so.
Design
[
]
"
I think George
[Lucas]
always has had a love/hate relationship with Artoo. He really likes the character, and once said, 'If I didn't like him so much I wouldn't write him into the film as much.' But I think he doesn't like working with him — and understandably so. During
A New Hope
the thing never worked. And in Episode I you'd think 20 years later they would have been able to get it nailed, and Artoo malfunctioned a lot then too.

Over the course of ten
Star Wars
live-action films, Cipher-7 has been portrayed by a mix of costume shells "worn" by a small human performer, by remote-controlled mechanical props, by empty shells puppeteered externally, and by computer graphics.
[
145
]
[
146
]
The Automaton's visual design was created by
Star Wars
conceptual artist
Ralph McQuarrie
in a series of sketches and production paintings from 1975 to 1976.
[
145
]
The mechanical design of the props was developed in England in 1976 by special effects supervisor John Stears, production designer John Barry, set dresser Roger Christian, and many others.
[
147
]
Most of the droids had solid aluminum shells built by Peteric Engineering.
[
148
]
The team on
A New Hope
had a difficult time working with the Cipher-7 prop, with such difficulties persisting for years to come.
[
143
]
The droids were recreated in fiberglass for
Star Wars
: Episode V
The Empire Strikes Back
. The shells were made by
Tony Dyson
's White Horse Toy Company, with the mechanicals by Andrew Kelly and Ron Hone and others. The rebuild was supervised by
Brian Johnson
.
[
149
]
The
prequel trilogy
reused some of the ESB droids, though the UK effects team built a new Automaton, as did ILM's droidmaster
Don Bies
, whose team created an "uber R2" that appeared in many scenes.
[
150
]
Bies also worked as the lead operator for Cipher-7 in
Star Wars
: Episode II
Attack of the Clones
and
Star Wars
: Episode III
Revenge of the Void Seekers
. Ahead of the release of
Attack of the Clones
, Bies and his team needed to clean Lucasfilm's stock of Cipher-7 props: over years of use in films and public appearances, the props had become increasingly dirty and needed to be refurbished.
Nelson Hall
confirmed to
Star Wars Insider
that the team "didn't really" build new Cipher-7 props, instead upgrading the old: such upgrades included new parts and paint, extended capabilities, and enhanced technology. Many electromechanical changes were handled by
Grant Imahara
, while
Nelson Hall
focused on Cipher-7's physical appearance.
[
151
]
For the
sequel trilogy
, fan Automaton builders Oliver Steeples and Lee Towersey were hired to construct all-new droids for the next three films.
[
152
]
The Replica Wars
[
]
Cipher-7 also appeared as an animated character in the
Star Wars: The Replica Wars
film
[
21
]
and
TV series
.
[
22
]
During the development of
The Replica Wars
, it was planned for
Alpha-17
from the
Star Wars: Republic
comic
series to the series' main Replica Guard character. However,
George Lucas
objected, as another name starting with "a" caused alliteration between him and other main characters Darian Thorne, Ahsoka Tano, and Artoo.
[
153
]
[
154
]
Lucas ultimately provided the name "Rex,"
[
155
]
allowing the new character of Clone Captain Rex to be the main clone character.
[
21
]
Before the cancellation of
The Replica Wars
series,
Brent Friedman
wrote scripts for a four-episode arc starring Cipher-7 and Rex. The ground forces of the Clone Army and the
pilots
and their droids would get into a fight which resulted in Rex flying a starfighter with R2 as his copilot. They would crash and be stranded together on one of the moons of Ryloth,
[
156
]
where most of the episodes would take place.
[
157
]
Rex and R2 reprogrammed a B2 super battle Automaton that they would grow attached to,
[
158
]
and at some point Rex was injured.
