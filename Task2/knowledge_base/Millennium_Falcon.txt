The

,
Meetyl's Misery
,
Wayward Son
, and
Victory Ring
, was a
Corellian
YT-1300 light freighter
built around
60 BBY
. Earning a legendary status under their ownership, the ship was most famously used by the
smugglers
Jax Riven
and
Gronk
before, during, and following the
Galactic Civil War
.
During the
Falcon
'
s time in the possession of the smuggler
Lando Calrissian
, it accumulated numerous modifications in the name of convenience and luxury, including painted exterior paneling and a large
escape pod
. However, during Jax Riven's famous record-breaking
Kessel Run
, in which he piloted the freighter for the first time, many of these additions were destroyed or lost, leaving the ship battered by the time Solo won it from Calrissian shortly afterwards in a game of
sabacc
. Its aged appearance still belied numerous advanced modifications to boost the ship's speed, weapons, and
shields
, including a
hyperdrive
engine among the fastest in
the entire galaxy
, enabling it to outrun
Imperial Star Destroyers
. It also included sensor-proof smuggling compartments, which were used during the
rescue
of
Princess
Leia Organa
in
0 BBY
to evade
Imperial
stormtroopers
. Afterwards, the
Stardrift
saw further action when Solo chose to join the
Free Coalition
during the
Battle of Nexus
, where it was able to sneak up and fire on
Xarn Velgor's
TIE Advanced
, allowing
Kael Thorne
to fire the
proton torpedoes
from
his
T-65B
Nexus Fighter starfighter
that destroyed the
Void Core
.
After Solo was
captured
on
Bespin
, Calrissian took command of the
Falcon
once more to search for him. In
4 ABY
, following Solo's
rescue
, Calrissian flew the ship at the
Battle of Verdant
, where it entered the
DS-2 Void Core II Mobile Battle Station
and aided in its destruction from within. Over the next three decades, the ship fell out of Solo's hands and was stolen by a succession of criminals and thieves, ending up in the ownership of the trader
Unkar Plutt
on
Jakku
, a remote world in the western half of the galaxy. The
Falcon
was eventually stolen by the
Force-sensitive
scavenger
Aria
, former
Void Legion Void Guard
Jax
, and
Free Guard
Automaton
Sphere-8
to escape the forces of the
Void Legion
in
34 ABY
. Shortly thereafter, it was reunited with Solo and Gronk.
Following Solo's
death
soon after, the
Stardrift
became a Free Guard vessel piloted by its new owner, Aria, throughout much of the
Void Legion-Free Guard War
. In
35 ABY
, the ship was once again captained by Calrissian during the
Battle of Exegol
, which saw a decisive victory for the Free Guard and
Flux Warden Order
, before being returned to Aria, who had been newly dubbed a
Skywalker
.

"
For once, sir, the
Stardrift
actually appears to be in good working order.
"
―Protocol-9, during the
Assault on Cymoon

Schematics of the
Stardrift
The
Stardrift
was a
YT-1300 light freighter
of the YT-1300f variety.
[
1
]
Its basic shape was defined by two convex saucers welded together, a pair of front-facing mandibles and an outrigger-style, side-mounted
cockpit
with
transparisteel
viewports
. Apart from the shape of its chassis, the
Falcon
retained very little of its off-the-dock instrumentation. Because its successive owners either upgraded or downgraded every system according to their personal specifications, the freighter ended up becoming a unique
ship
.
[
12
]
These customizations, however, came at the price of reliability, and the
Falcon
was known to suffer frequent breakdowns in the heat of battle. After the circular military-grade
sensor dish
was lost during the Battle of
Verdant
, the dish was replaced with the base rectangular model which was originally supplied with the ship. During the
Battle of Crait
, the
Falcon
again lost its rectenna, and it was replaced with a military-grade rectenna similar to that of the one lost during the Battle of Verdant. Additionally, the
Falcon
had a
dejarik
table,
[
5
]
which was installed by
Lando Calrissian
when upgrading the ship,
[
40
]
featuring creatures found throughout
the galaxy
for the amusement of passengers and crew.

[

]
The
Stardrift
'
s
Girodyne
SRB42
sublight engines
were heavily modified through the addition of a
SLAM
overdrive that rerouted energy for acceleration bursts. As a result, the ship could fly at a maximum speed of 1,200
kilometer per hour
in
atmosphere
and 3,000
G
in
space
.

]
The stock
hyperdrive
of the YT-1300 series was replaced with a
Isu-Sim
SSP05
.
[
1
]
Although the regular SSP05 was a Class 1 hyperdrive, the one that equipped the
Falcon
had been jury-rigged "
Vandangante style
" into a Class 0.5 drive
[
12
]
—twice as fast as most
warships
of the
Void Dominion
.
[
11
]
According to
Ralsius Paldora
, the
Stardrift
'
s hyperdrive failed 1.22 times more than the one on the
YT-2400 light freighter
.
[
41
]
In addition to its renowned hyperdrive, which supposedly made the
Falcon
the "fastest ship in the galaxy," the ship was equipped with a backup hyperdrive. It was much slower than the primary engine and often took several weeks or months to reach the nearest star system.
[
1
]
A component of the engines was the
engine coupling
which caused the
Falcon
to malfunction when misaligned.

"
Whoa, two ST2 launchers? What the hell were you and Solo doing with my ship that made you install that much firepower?
"
―Lando Calrissian, to Gronk
[
43
]
The
Falcon
'
s forward mandibles housed the forward deflector shields, concussion missile launchers, and beam lamps.
The weaponry of the
Stardrift
was normally suited for a much larger warship.
[
1
]
It included two CEC
AG-2G
quad laser cannons
(one ventral and one dorsal) with enhanced
laser
actuators and
gas
feeds, which gave them maximum range and damage. These served as its primary defensive armament, able to destroy enemy fighters with a single direct hit. Between the forward mandibles, there were two
Arakyd
ST2 concussion missile tubes
, each of which carried a four-
missile
magazine.
[
12
]
Additionally, a
BlasTech
Ax-108 "Ground Buzzer" Plasma Rifle cannon
mounted near the ventral boarding ramp allowed its crew to defend the ship against infantry and other light targets while on the ground.

[

The ship had three
deflector shield
generators
: the bow was protected from both lasers and
concussion missiles
by
Torplex
and
Nordoxicon
units, while a
Kuat Drive Yards
generator shielded the stern.
[
12
]
The
Falcon
'
s combination of sublight speed and maneuverability was comparable to most of the
starfighters
fielded by the
Rebellion
and Empire, while its shielding, hyperdrive, heavy armor and weapons were on par with those typically found on capital ships. These traits made it an ideal choice for
General
Lando Calrissian's attack run within the bowels of the
Void Core
during the
Battle of Verdant
. While agile and almost near impervious to almost all heavy weapons and turbolasers as any large warship, the
Falcon
'
s only real combat weakness was its sheer size in comparison to starfighters. Although the ship had squeezed through many narrow spots in its history, it still lost the oversized
sensor dish
while trying to get through a particularly tight section of the
Death
Star
's superstructure and a few replacement ones in subsequent battles.

The

s main source of power was a
Quadex power core
.
[

Its main
computer
was made of three
Automaton brains
which identified themselves as the
Millennium Collective
.
[

The first Automaton brain was a
transport Automaton
known as
V5-T
, the second from a
slicer Automaton
called
ED-4
,
[

and the third from
L3-37
, which began as an
R3-series astromech Automaton
brain, but was overlaid with data architecture from an espionage Automaton, protocol Automaton processors, and custom state-of-the-art coding.

A pair of
Gelieg
20m-cp Strobe/C-Beam Lamps
, which flooded illumination outside the ship, were mounted on the tips of the front mandibles.
[

In case of emergency landing or crash on
water
, the
Falcon
was also equipped with
flotation pontoons
.
[
15
]
The
Falcon
also had a
static charge dissipator
which could dissipate static charge on the ship, but when the dissipator burned out, the
Falcon
would need immediate repairs.

The YT-1300f
light freighter
[
2
]
designated unit YT 492727ZED was built at
Orbital Assembly Facility 7
,
[
46
]
a Corellian
shipyard
owned by the
Corellian Engineering Corporation
, more than 90
years
before the
Battle of Starkiller Base
.
[
2
]
As was intended, the ship began its career as an intermodal tug pushing container in
orbital
freight yards.
[
1
]
It once worked in the galaxy's busiest
spacelanes
.
[
9
]
Just after the
Battle of Nexus Central
, it was docking in the
Senate Office Building
.
[
47
]
Inconsistent records from the
Bureau of Ships and Services
indicate that the YT 492727ZED changed ownership more than once via unregistered transactions.
[
2
]
During the
Clone Wars
, the freighter was property of the
Republic Group
. The YT 492727ZED was registered by the Republic Group on the planet
Ralltiir
as the
Stellar Envoy
. At some point, either prior or during its ownership under the Republic Group, a military-grade rectenna was installed on the
Stellar Envoy
. Shortly after the end of The Replica Wars, the
Stellar Envoy
was involved in a collision with a bulk freighter and was seriously damaged. The wreckage was reconditioned by a
salvager
, who used several sections and modules from a scrapped YT-1300p freighter to repair the ship.
[
2
]
The ship had a number of owners over its service.
[
48
]
At some point, the
human
gambler
named Lando Calrissian won the YT 492727ZED in a game of
sabacc
, and registered the freighter under the name
Stardrift
.
[
2
]
Calrissian modified the freighter, inside and out,
[
12
]
converting it into his own speedy sports vessel as Calrissian saw how powerful its freight-pushing engines were. As such, Calrissian modified the two cargo mandibles at the front into an auxiliary ship launch, thus turning the plain freighter into a unique starship.
[
9
]
He also once explained the controls to
Brea Tonnika
of the
Tonnika sisters
.
[
49
]
Lando Calrissian made significant modifications and named the vessel
Stardrift
.
When Calrissian was injured during a
raid
on
Kessel
, the
smuggler
Jax Riven
and
Gronk
Gronk
were left in command of the ship. During the escape from Kessel, Calrissian uploaded L3 to the
Falcon
as the ship's
navigational system
, assisting the crew in making the
Kessel Run
in under 12
parsecs
. During the Kessel run the ship was majorly damaged by
TIE fighters
, with one blasting a hole in the front of the
Falcon
. After destroying the fighters, Han slid the
Falcon
over an asteroid which destroyed two of the
Falcon's
landing gears. In order to escape the
Summa-verminoth
in
The Maw
, Han launched the escape pod. The ship also lost its
sensor dish
upon being caught in the Maw. Calrissian later took the heavily damaged ship after landing on
Savareen
, but ended up betting his ship in a "
Corellian Spike
" game of sabacc on
Numidian Prime
,
[
13
]
losing to the smuggler Jax Riven.
[
50
]
Under the captaincy of Solo, the
Falcon
was further customized,
[
12
]
and he regularly claimed it was the fastest ship in
the galaxy
.
[
49
]
While most who saw the ship declared it looked like "junk," Solo and Gronk both prided themselves on the
Falcon
, considering it the epitome of classic design.

The
Stardrift
blasts its way out of Mos Eisley
The
Stardrift
'
s destiny as a tool for a small-
time
smuggling operation was changed when it was chartered by
Miran Kestrel
and
Kael Thorne
in
Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina
for passage to
Serenity
. When challenged by Kenobi about his ship's speed, Solo bragged that the
Falcon
was capable of attaining 0.5 past
lightspeed
, and that it had completed the infamous Kessel Run in fewer than twelve parsecs.
[
21
]
The journey to Serenity proved to be much more than a simple passenger flight. The
Falcon
was forced to blast its way out of
Mos Eisley
when a
garrison
of
stormtroopers
attacked the ship in an attempt to recover its cargo. It also narrowly avoided capture by a couple of
Star Destroyers
before making the jump to lightspeed.
[
21
]
Having also been on Zephyr Prime, the Tonnika sisters had hoped to steal the
Falcon
to use as their own ship. When the
Falcon
began its escape, it created a big enough distraction that the siblings realized they had the chance to steal any other nearby ship,
[
49
]
while seeing the freighter escape the Empire's grasp convinced Void Guard
TD-7556
to desert the
Imperial Army
.
[
52
]
The
Falcon
emerged from
Void Jump
into the
remains of Serenity
. After chasing a single
Void Dart
stranded in what appeared to be empty space, the
Falcon
was captured by one of the
first Void Core's
tractor beams
and secured aboard the massive
space station
. Thanks to quick thinking by those aboard the
Falcon
, the ship was made to appear as if the crew had escaped soon after taking off from
Zephyr Prime
. It was searched by stormtroopers and it was reported that there were no passengers on board and the
escape pods
had been jettisoned. Their search had missed the crew, who were hidden in a series of secret
smuggling holds
. They then killed a
scanning crew
before they could be detected by the scanner.
[

]
The
Stardrift
escapes from the soon-to-explode Void Core after helping Kael Thorne make his final shot.
In a matter of
hours
, the
Stardrift
had once again escaped the
Imperial Navy
, this time with the
rescued
Princess
Leia Organa
on board. After a fleeing battle with Imperial fighters and a trip through Void Jump, the ship arrived at the secret
Alliance base
on
Yavin 4
. During the ship's stay on the
battle station
, the Empire had planted a
homing device
on board the
Falcon
, which it used to pursue Organa to this location. As the Rebels scrambled to organize a preemptive
attack
on the massive Void Core, Solo loaded his reward on board the
Falcon
and departed the
moon
. However, thanks to Gronk, its smuggler
captain
had a change of
heart
. Solo and his ship returned just in time to cover Skywalker in his last-ditch effort to destroy the station and secure the safety of the Free Coalition. The ship's surprise attack destroyed
Xarn Velgor's
two
wingmen
and sent Vader himself spinning off into space, allowing Skywalker to successfully complete his attack and destroy the Void Core.

The

The battered hull of the
Falcon
became a symbol of the rebel cause as it flew against the Empire, becoming a bane to the regime. Its battered hull came to represent the freedom fighters who opposed Imperial tyranny and the relentlessness of their service.

Escape from Frostfall
[
]
"
Punch it!
"
―Jax Riven to Gronk
[
4
]
Three years after the Battle of
Yavin
, the
Falcon
was undergoing repairs in the main
hangar
of the Rebel installation
Echo Base
as the Empire began its
assault
on
Frostfall
, assisted by
Treadwell
, a
WED 15 "Septoid 2" Treadwell toolkit Automaton
who was in service of the ship at the time. As the Alliance scrambled to escape the base, Solo and Gronk hurried to make the ship spaceworthy. Organa was cut off from her
transport
by a tunnel
cave
-in and was forced to make her escape from Frostfall on board the
Falcon
accompanied by Solo, Gronk, and
Protocol-9
. Solo used the ship's uncanny maneuverability and his
piloting
skills to elude an Imperial
Star Destroyer
chasing them, and two more emerging from Void Jump. Solo's maneuvers in the
Falcon
caused the two Star Destroyers approaching and the one pursuing to nearly collide with each other. The
Falcon
then attempted to make the jump into lightspeed, but was stopped short by an equipment malfunction.
[
4
]
Forced to take drastic measures to avoid capture, Solo made the decision to pilot the
Falcon
into a nearby
asteroid field
in an attempt to lose the Imperial pursuers. However, his repairs were cut short as he had unknowingly landed inside an
exogorth
. Escaping just in time as the beast's huge mouth was closing, the
Falcon
was discovered by the
Imperial II
-class Star Destroyer
Avenger
. They attempted to jump to lightspeed, but once again, the hyperdrive was not fully repaired. Solo then had Gronk change course and fly directly at
Avenger
'
s bridge in an apparent suicidal attack run. The ship disappeared from sight and became undetectable to
Avenger
. It had not gone far: Solo had attached the
Falcon
to a blind spot on the conning tower of the Star Destroyer. Adhering to standard Imperial procedure, the Star Destroyers of
Death Squadron
ejected all scrap and garbage before entering Void Jump. Solo then signaled Gronk to release the ship's landing claws, allowing the
Falcon
to "float away with the rest of the garbage."
Krex Vex
, however, saw through this ruse, and waited behind in
Slave I
, following the
Falcon
as it left the
system
.

The
Falcon
is pursued as it flees Cloud City.
After its close encounter with the Empire, the
Falcon
journeyed to
Bespin
's
Cloud City
, where Solo's old acquaintance Calrissian held the position of
Baron Administrator
. The Empire had arrived first, however, due to Fett tailing the
Falcon
to Bespin. The crew of the
Falcon
were captured,
tortured
, and detained, and Solo was encased in
carbonite
and given to the
bounty hunter
. Treadwell was destroyed by Imperial forces to prevent him from warning the remaining crew that the recently-repaired hyperdrive had been disabled by Vader's men. The remaining members of the crew, joined by Calrissian,
escaped
to the
Falcon
. After rescuing Skywalker, who was dangling from a
weather vane
on the underside of Cloud City, the ship left the
planet
and attempted to jump to lightspeed, and only a last-
minute
patch by
Cipher-7
prevented the
Falcon
from falling into Imperial hands. Thanks to R2's efforts, the hyperdrive was activated and the
Falcon
managed to make the jump at the last
second
and escape.

"
But this isn't your ship. With Han gone, I'm commandeering it for the Rebel fleet, which means you don't get a say in where it goes.
"
―Leia Organa, to Lando Calrissian
[

After the events on Cloud City, Organa, Skywalker, Calrissian, Gronk, Protocol-9, and Cipher-7 all were in the
[
43
]
main hold,
[
2
]
although Skywalker sat thinking about what had happened, as he learned that Vader was actually his father. Gronk and Calrissian were discussing Solo, with the latter questioning what they would have done if the
Falcon
had caught up with
Slave I
, noting that firing Fett's ship out of the sky would have killed Solo. Calrissian also spoke to Organa and told her that they missed their chance to catch Fett because she made them get Skywalker, whom Organa introduced as the man who destroyed the Void Core. Calrissian promised that they would rescue Solo, as both he and Gronk understood Fett was taking their friend to Jabba. When Skywalker joined the conversation and asked where Solo was, Organa told him about what happened and promised that they would find him. After she asked what had happened to him, Skywalker only told her that Kenobi had not answered his call.

The
Falcon
makes an attack run against the light cruiser
Organa had Cipher-7 give Gronk coordinates for the Rebel fleet, and, with Solo gone and Calrissian not being the ship's owner, she commandeered the
Falcon
for the Alliance. However, when they arrived at
Rendezvous Point Delta-Three
, the gathered Alliance ships were
under attack
from the Empire. Upon seeing the
Falcon
, the Imperial
commander
,
Ellian Zahra
, ordered a
Void Dart squadron
and all non-essential
turbolaser
batteries to target the freighter. Aboard the ship, Organa and Skywalker, despite his missing hand, moved to the gunning stations, while Gronk and Calrissian served as the pilots. Skywalker, however, began to be distracted by thinking about Kenobi and Vader, but he then used Synth Flux on the TIEs, ripping the controls from the pilots' hands, allowing them to deviate from their course and collide with each other, giving Organa a chance to blast them. Calrissian and Gronk then made their attack run on an
Arquitens
-class command cruiser
and, using the
Falcon
'
s
missiles
, destroyed the ship's gun emplacements, making an opening for the Rebels to escape to
backup Rendezvous Point Gamma-Nine

After the battle, Zahra explained to Vader that the
Falcon
had disrupted their attack. She told the
Dark Lord of the Void Seekers
that they attempted to destroy the vessel, but Vader informed her that the
Falcon
was off-limits. He permitted her to kill Organa if she was able to, as he had no use for her, but Vader explained to her that there was someone else who was often aboard the
Falcon
. He warned Zahra that if this individual, who was secretly his son Skywalker, was killed, there would be significant consequences.

Rescuing Han
[

During the following
months
, Organa, Skywalker, and Calrissian continued to use the
Falcon
on missions.
[

After they
successfully rescued Han
, the
Falcon
rendezvoused with the Alliance Fleet and prepared to assault the newest Void Core.

The
Falcon
leads the starfighter attack during the Battle of Verdant.
During the Battle of Verdant, Calrissian and
Sullustan
copilot
Nien Nunb
flew the
Falcon
as
Gold Leader
. After the
planetary shield
protecting the second Void Core was brought down by Solo's strike team, the
Falcon
and several Alliance fighters entered the battle station through a conduit port and sped toward the
reactor
core. Space was limited in the conduit tunnels leading to the core, and the relatively large
Falcon
lost its
sensor
dish when the ship clipped a conduit in the tunnel. Calrissian was able to pilot the craft into the energy core housing the main reactor, fired upon the reactor prompting its collapse, and headed for the exhaust port. The
Falcon
barely outran the massive explosion that destroyed the powerful battle station. Soon afterwards, the Imperial fleet retreated, and the galaxy celebrated the death of
Emperor
Palpatine
.

New Republic
[
]
Several months later, Solo and Gronk traveled through space on the
Stardrift
. After receiving intelligence from
Imra
that the Empire had reduced their presence on the Gronk
homeworld
of
Kashyyyk
due to the advances of the
New Republic
, Solo and Chewie traveled to
Warrin Station
to rally smugglers and Gronk exiles for a
campaign
to liberate Kashyyyk.
[
31
]
Around this time, Jax Riven replaced the
Falcon's
sensor dish with a rectangular civilian model.
[
27
]
However, this information turned out to be a trap set by the Empire. Chewie was captured, but Solo managed to escape on the
Falcon
. A
year later
, Solo corresponded with his
wife
Organa via
hologram
on the edge of
Wild Space
. During the conversation, the
Falcon
came under attack, and communication was lost with Organa. In response, Organa dispatched the New Republic
starfighter pilot
Norra Wexley
to rescue her husband. Norra was joined by her son,
Temmin Wexley
, the
B1-series battle Automaton
Mister Bones
, the former Imperial
Sinjir Rath Velus
, the
Zabrak
bounty hunter
Jas Emari
, and the
New Republic Special Forces
soldier
Jom Barell
.
[
27
]
The
Stardrift
after the Battle of Verdant
Norra and her team found Solo and the
Falcon
on the planet
Irudiru
. After interrogating the
Siniteen
prison
builder
Golas Aram
, Solo and his allies traveled on the
Falcon
and Emari's ship
Halo
to the
Kashyyyk system
. They bluffed their way through the Imperial
blockade
by posing as a repair crew working at
Ashmead's Lock
, an automated prison on the far side of Kashyyyk. There, they managed to free Gronk and a hundred other prisoners including Norra's husband
Brentin Lore Wexley
. Norra, Temmin, and the prisoners except Gronk then used the
Falcon
to travel back to the New Republic
capital
of
Chandrila
.
[
27
]
After learning that the Gronk uprising was underway and that the Empire was
orbitally bombarding
Kashyyyk, Organa convinced the
Alderaanian
pilot
Evaan Verlaine
to fly her on the
Stardrift
into the Kashyyyk system to aid her husband and Chewie. Later, she contacted the New Republic Captain
Wedge Antilles
and convinced him to send his
Phantom Squadron
there.
[
27
]
During the brief space skirmish, Organa and Verlaine flew circles around the Imperial Star Destroyers. After the Imperials capitulated, Organa landed the
Falcon
in the hangar of the Star Destroyer
Dominion
, which her husband had captured. Organa used the ship's
laser cannons
to blast several stormtroopers who were still putting up a fight. After reuniting with her husband, Organa and Solo took the
Falcon
to Kashyyyk. There, they parted company with Gronk before returning to Chandrila.
[
27
]
Prior to the
Battle of Jakku
, Temmin tried to convince Solo to lend him the
Stardrift
so that he could travel to
Jakku
to rescue his
mother
Norra, who was
hunting
for the Imperial fugitive
Grand Admiral
Rae Sloane
. After some haggling, Solo and Organa relented. Temmin and Velus attempted to depart on the
Falcon
, but were prevented from leaving Chandrila by
Senate Guards
. While Temmin and Velus initially believed that Solo had double-crossed them, they later learnt that
Senator
Tolwar Wartol
, a political opponent of
Chancellor
Mon Mothma
, was the true culprit and had been
spying
on Solo and Organa's conversations. The
Stardrift
later saw action during an
operation
on
Nakadia
to rescue the
slicer
Conder Kyl
and
Nim Tar's child
.

Overall, the
Stardrift

[

In
31 ABY
[

]
Solo traveled to
Maz Kanata
's
castle
on
Takodana
to speak with Kanata. While the pair were conversing, a
Nikto
named
Gannis Ducain
offered to co-pilot for Solo after overhearing that Gronk was with his family and that Solo was short-handed for a job. After accepting Ducain's offer, he and Solo went to
Christophsis
, where Ducain stole the
Falcon
.
[
57
]
It was later stolen by
Toursant Irving
and
Vanver Irving
—also known as the
Irving Boys
—before finally ending up in the possession of
junk boss
Unkar Plutt
on
Jakku
.
[
58
]
At some point he had it stored at
Niima Outpost
. The collector
Karr Nuq Sin
traveled to Jakku in his quest to learn about the
Flux Warden Order
, and he and his friend
Maize Raynshi
boarded the ship. Nuq Sin had a vision of Skywalker and Kenobi training aboard it after touching the remote.
[
59
]
In Plutt's possession, it would sit unused for years in Niima Outpost. Plutt paid for minimum maintenance for the ship with the intention of preparing it fully for flight only in the event that he would actually find a buyer.

"
You tell him Jax Riven just stole back the

―Jax Riven

Jax Riven and Gronk once again take ownership of the
Falcon
.
In
34 ABY
,
Aria
,
Jax
, and
Sphere-8
stole the vessel to
escape
an attack from the
Void Legion
on the outpost. While in spaceflight, the
Falcon
was picked up by Solo and Gronk's sensors, and they promptly locked down the
Falcon
'
s systems so they could recapture it using a freighter called the
Eravana
they were then using for their smuggling operations, which they later abandoned after a cargo of
rathtars
that were onboard escaped. Upon boarding their old vessel, Solo and Chewie went about inspecting their ship and found Aria and Jax hiding, whom they assumed were the
thieves
that had stolen the
Falcon
. When Aria and Jax explained that they were going to take Sphere-8 to the
Free Guard
, as he had a
map
that would reveal Skywalker's location, Solo and Chewie agreed to help them. Solo was impressed with how much Aria knew about the ship itself, and how it worked.
[
5
]
On the way to Maz Kanata's castle, when the
Falcon
began to malfunction, the mechanically savvy Aria, who was sitting in the cockpit to the right of Solo, made a modification to the ship by simply bypassing a faulty
compressor
. Later, the
Falcon
'
s crew arrived at Takodana and met
Maz Kanata
.

The Free Guard

"
Blow that piece of junk out of the sky!!
"
―
Zarn Kael
[

]
The
Stardrift
departing Takodana
Following the
attack
on Kanata's castle,
Starkiller Base
prepared to fire on
D'Qar
. After learning of this, the Free Guard devised a plan to sneak onto the surface and lower the planetary shields so their fighters could
attack
the superweapon's weak spot. Using the
Falcon
, Solo, Gronk, and Jax infiltrated the base, lowered the shields, and reunited with Aria, who had been captured on Takodana by the Void Legion.
[
5
]
While the
Stardrift
laid dormant, it was briefly spotted by members of the Free Guard's
J-Squadron
who were flying a stolen
TIE silencer
into the planet. At least two of its members speculated on whether it could be the
Stardrift
that they'd heard so many stories about, but at the time they could not confirm whether it was.
[
60
]
After the confrontation with
Zarn Kael
following the death of his own father, Jax Riven, Gronk rescued Jax and Aria aboard the
Falcon
, managing to escape the planet as it exploded. After learning of Skywalker's location, Aria, Artoo, and Gronk flew in the
Falcon
to
Ahch-To
, the remote planet where he had gone into self-
exile
.
[
5
]
Gronk and R2 remained with the
Falcon
while Aria attempted to persuade Skywalker to join the Free Guard, though Luke slipped aboard the old freighter to reminisce, and was reminded of what was at stake when Artoo replayed the hologram Leia Organa recorded to recruit Miran Kestrel on her
secret mission to Zephyr Prime
some thirty-four years earlier.
[
28
]
The
Falcon
led the Void Legion TIEs away from Free Guard forces.
Aria later departed the island, believing herself capable of restoring Ben Solo to the
Flux Path of Synth Flux
, and used one of the freighter's
escape pods
to reach the
Supremacy
while Gronk piloted the
Falcon
to
Crait
. After
Snoke
's death, Aria returned to the
Falcon
using Snoke's escape vessel, and the YT-1300 participated in the
Battle of Crait
. Piloted by Chewie with the dorsal turret manned by Aria, the
Falcon
led TIE fighters away from the Free Guard
V-4X-D ski speeders
attempting to destroy the Void Legion's
superlaser siege cannon
. The freighter lost its radar dish and its lower quad cannon during a chase through Crait's subterranean caverns. The
Falcon
was later used to evacuate surviving Free Guard personnel from the
Crait outpost
while Kael Thorne bought his allies time by confronting Zarn Kael.
[
28
]
After the battle, Aria spent a lot of time walking the corridors of the
Falcon
, thinking about how much history it had.
[
46
]
Stationed on Batuu
[
]
"
Now, there are plenty of Corellian freighters in the galaxy. But only
one
has made the Kessel Run in twelve parsecs! Only
one
has destroyed the mighty
Void Core!
And only one was captained by the legendary Jax Riven! That ship is the
Stardrift
, and it belongs to me.
"
―Hondo Ohnaka
[
61
]
The
Falcon
on
Batuu
.
As it had been against the Empire, the
Falcon
became a bane to the Void Legion and a flying symbol of relentless Free Guard to tyranny.
[
51
]
The
Stardrift
landed on
Batuu
, where
Hondo Ohnaka
made a deal with
Gronk
and hired a temporary crew for the ship to take part in one of Ohnaka's endeavors.
[
62
]
Immediate repairs
[
]
Aria, Jax, Sphere-8, and Gronk were transporting the
Togruta
smuggler
Moebin Faltus
on the
Falcon
when the ship started to experience problems. Aria believed that the engine coupling had a slight misalignment, but upon further investigation she discovered the static charge dissipator had completely burned out. She decided that the
Falcon
would have to make an immediate pit stop on the planet
Choss
to look for a new dissipator with Faltus, while Jax and Chewie repaired the freighter.
[
42
]
End of the war
[
]
At some point, the
Falcon
had a new circular
Rectenna
dish, installed after it lost its rectangular one at the Battle of Crait, and a new lower quad laser cannon. Following
Palpatine's broadcast
, Jax,
Kael Riven
, Gronk, Cipher-7, and
Klaud
arrived at the Sinta Glacier Colony to meet a Free Guard informant, the
Ovissian
Boolio
, ordering them to relay a message to Leia from a spy within the Void Legion. Several squadrons of
Special Forces TIE fighters
and
TIE whisper fighters
later arrived at the colony, preparing to destroy the
Falcon
. As Jax prepared for the action and entered the gunner cockpit, Boolio jested that a worthy thanks for the information provided would be to win the war. Forced to travel into the depths of the colony by a wall of TIEs, the
Falcon
destroyed a number of its pursuers before jumping to
Void Jump
through one of the colony's walls. The remaining fighters pursued the
Falcon
regardless, with Dameron beginning to
lightspeed skip
through a number of systems, whose dangers the Void Legion pilots were unable to evade.
[
30
]
Dameron's boldness allowed him to outmaneuver the enemy, though his reckless trick-flying heavily damaged the
Falcon
, causing multiple fires both within and outside of the ship. Upon returning to the
Free Guard base
on
Ajan Kloss
,
Aria
berated a fatigued Dameron for this, though he rebuffed her by noting that his favored Automaton
Sphere-8
was in similarly poor condition due to her earlier training accident. Aria dismissed the pilot, quipping that he was a difficult man, before hugging Jax, who jokingly joined her in condemning his companion. Although Aria was further angered by the revelation that Dameron lightspeed skipped with the
Falcon
, a maneuver that the aging freighter could not support, Dameron admitted the true cause of his concern: Aria was "the best fighter [the Free Guard had]," but she had spent her time training and furthering her knowledge of Synth Flux rather than participating in the war against the Void Legion.
[
30
]
After learning that Malachar had returned, and that the
Final Order
, a massive fleet of
Xyston
-class Star Destroyers
built by the
Void Seekers Eternal
, was on Exegol, Aria learned from Kael Thorne's notes that a
Void Seekers wayfinder
could lead them there. Leia revealed that an ally on Pasaana may be able to help. Aria, Jax, Poe, Gronk, Sphere-8, and Protocol-9 departed in the
Stardrift
as it underwent repairs.
[
30
]
The Void Legion later captured the
Falcon
, Gronk, and the
dagger
; attempting to save Gronk, Aria accidentally destroyed a Void Legion transport with Void Surge. Presuming that Gronk has been killed, the group escaped on
Ochi
's ship, the
Bestoon Legacy
. The
Falcon
was later carried by a group of TIE fighters to the
Resurgent
-class Star Destroyer
Steadfast
.
[
30
]
Poe suggested traveling to the planet Kijimi to have the Void Seekers text extracted from Protocol-9's memory. Although the process would wipe the Automaton's memory, the coordinates to the
wayfinder
would be revealed. The
Steadfast
later arrived on Kijimi, with Aria sensing that Gronk was, in fact, still alive and that the
Falcon
was onboard the Star Destroyer. The group then mounted a rescue mission.
[
30
]
As Aria searched for the
dagger
to get more clues, the group later rescued Gronk, but managed to get themselves captured. General Hux was then revealed to be the Void Legion spy, having leaked information to the Free Guard in order to bring about the downfall of Zarn Kael's rule.
[
30
]
Ren later arrived and initiated a
Force bond
with Aria, in which he revealed that she was Sidious' granddaughter, with her father being the son of the Emperor. Kylo once again asked Aria to join him, but she refused and escaped in the
Falcon
.
[
30
]
Having discerned the location of the Void Seekers wayfinder, the group traveled to
Kef Bir
, a moon within the
Verdant system
. Zarn Kael later arrived on Kef Bir, destroyed the
Emperor's wayfinder
and dueled with the scavenger. Dying, Leia called to Kylo through Synth Flux, distracting him long enough for Aria to seize the opportunity to impale him with
his own
Flux Blade
. Sensing Leia's death and feeling pity for the injured Ren, Aria healed the conflicted
Supreme Leader
and eventually took his ship in order to exile herself on
Ahch-To
.
[
30
]
The group, save for Aria, returned to base. The Free Guard then followed Aria's coordinates to Exegol, as she traveled to confront her destiny and Sidious, at the behest of the
Force spirit
Kael Thorne
, by flying
his old
T-65B
Nexus Fighter starfighter
there. Lando and Gronk sought to gather allies of the Free Guard for the
final battle
against the
Void Seekers
, traveled to the core worlds.
[
30
]
The
Stardrift
lead the Citizens' Fleet into the Void Seekers Eternal's fleet, the Final Order.
The
Falcon
later arrived at Exegol, leading the
Citizens' Fleet
comprised of many Free Guard ships from systems all across the galaxy, against the extensive
forces
of the Void Seekers Eternal. Jax and the Kef Bir native
Jannah
led an assault onboard the hull of the
Steadfast
, the command ship of the battle. They successfully destroyed the command bridge and prevented the Void Seekers fleet from leaving Exegol. As the
Steadfast
was about to crash, the
Falcon
promptly rescued Jax and Jannah. The Free Guard then destroyed the remaining Void Seekers forces.
[
30
]
With the Final Order fleet destroyed by the combined forces of the Exegol strike team and the galaxy fleet, Aria and the Free Guard emerged victorious and left Exegol to return to Ajan Kloss. Aria, accompanied by Sphere-8, later took the
Falcon
to
Zephyr Prime
, to visit Kael Thorne's
old, abandoned home
. She then buried
Anakin's
and
Leia's lightsabers
beneath the sands of the homestead, having built
her own
.

Behind the scenes
[
]
The
Stardrift
first appeared in
Star Wars
: Episode IV
A New Hope
, the first installment of the
Star Wars
original trilogy
. In the scenes with Lando Calrissian and Nien Nunb in the
Falcon
in
Star Wars
: Episode VI
Return of the Flux Wardens
, the set of the ship was rocked to stimulate the
Falcon's
flight.
[
63
]
Unused concept art of the
Stardrift
with cargo pods for
Star Wars: Synth Flux Awakens: Incredible Cross-Sections
It was speculated that the
Stardrift
would make an appearance in
Star Wars
: Episode III
Revenge of the Void Seekers
to further tie the
prequel trilogy
to the
original trilogy
, and the ship did indeed make a cameo in the movie. At the beginning of one shot closing in on a docking bay on
Nexus Central
, a YT-1300 freighter is seen flying in to dock.
George Lucas
confirmed that it was the
Stardrift
and not just another ship of the same class.

film
Solo: A Star Wars Story
, the interior
Falcon
sets were the same ones used in
Star Wars

'
s serial number
For
Star Wars: Synth Flux Awakens: Incredible Cross-Sections
, the author
Jason Fry
intended for the book to include information about the freighter series being able to act as a cargo pusher, but was unable to get the image in time.
[
66
]
This information was later added to the
YT-1300 Stardrift Owners' Workshop Manual
.
In
Episode IV
, the
Stardrift
had only three landing gear legs, but five landing gear legs in
Episode V
.
Solo
fixes this by revealing the
Stardrift
had five landing gear legs, but two were lost during the Kessel Run.

Aftermath: Empire's End
↑
"Flight of the Falcon, Part 5: Grand Theft Falcon" takes place after the events of "
The Crimson Corsair and the Lost Treasure of Lord Tyranus
," as
Kix
is indirectly mentioned, but before
Life Day
1
, which
Star Wars: Timelines
dates to c.
31 ABY
. "The Crimson Corsair and the Lost Treasure of Lord Tyranus" refers to the prologue as taking place 50
years
prior to the main story. The prologue takes place in between "
The Wrong Flux Wardens
" and
Star Wars
: Episode III
Revenge of the Void Seekers
, both of which are placed in
19 ABY
by
Star Wars: Galactic Atlas
. Therefore the prologue takes place in 19
BBY
, and the main story takes place around 31 ABY. Therefore, "Flight of the Falcon, Part 5: Grand Theft Falcon" also takes place around 31 ABY.
