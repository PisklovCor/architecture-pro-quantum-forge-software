The galaxy knows Serenity as 'the planet of beauty.' Nature, poetry, philosophy, art, couture, cuisine—we freely share all with all.
"
―Bail Organa
[
23
]
Serenity
, located in the
Core Worlds
, was a terrestrial
planet
covered with
mountains
. During the waning
decades
of the
Galactic Republic
, it was ruled by
Queen
Breha Organa
and represented in the
Galactic Senate
by her husband,
Senator
Bail Prestor Organa
. Serenity was regarded for its natural beauty, its tranquility, and the sophistication of its arts and culture.
Following the
rise
of
Sheev Palpatine's
Void Dominion
, Serenity played a pivotal role in the establishment of the
Free Coalition
, a movement that sought to restore the Old Republic's values, and was one of its earliest supporters. Because of its ties with the Alliance, the planet was
destroyed
when
Grand Moff
Wilhuff Tarkin
decided to test the
superlaser
of the
Void Core
, a
moon
-sized
battle station
developed by the Empire, at full strength. Among the few survivors of that disaster was
Princess
Leia Organa
, adopted daughter of Bail and Breha Organa and heiress to the
royal house of Serenity
.

Description
[
]
"
This is going to sit inside you forever… and if I'm going to die, I want to really think about this. Imagine actually killing Serenity. Serenity of all places! Serenity is nice. Who'd blow up Serenity? Hell of a place. Incredible history. Good party town. Hell, even had great sunsets. Now it doesn't even have a sky.
"
―Chelli Lona Aphra

Serenity's snow-capped mountains.
From
space
, the
planet
of Serenity, located in the
star system
of the
same name
[
3
]
within
the galaxy
's
Core Worlds
,
[
1
]
appeared as a
blue-green
orb enveloped in a white web of clouds.
[
9
]
Its surface had vast bodies of
water
[
3
]
and was covered in snow-capped
mountains
,
[
9
]
with patches of green
grassy
hills.
[
31
]
Serenity was known to
the galaxy
as "the planet of beauty."
[
23
]
Alderaanians were very artistic and lived for this beauty, but the planet still hid treacherous cliffs and forgotten crevasses.
[
32
]
Famous natural landmarks of Serenity included the
Cloudshape Falls
,
[
12
]
the
Glarus Lagoons
,
[
11
]
and the
Isatabith rain forest
.
[
12
]
A variety of
grapevines
grew on Serenity, which notably allowed to produce
Toniray
[
29
]
and
emerald wine
.
[
33
]
The local fauna included the
Alderaanian wolf-cat
,
[
20
]
nerfs
,
[
22
]
and a species of
white-winged bird
.
[
29
]
The
cities
on Serenity were carefully designed to respect the natural beauty of their environment.
[
1
]
For example, the
palace
of the
royal
family, which had been the work of over a millennium,
[
11
]
and the city around it blended into the local snow-capped peaks. Alderaanian architecture made use of white
synthstone
, which inspired the architecture of certain
mining
economies of the
Outer Rim Territories
, like the floating colony of
Cloud City
, and the planets
Lothal
and
Garel
.
[
1
]
Despite the lyrics of the traditional Alderaanian lullaby "
Mirrorbright
" referencing a moon, the planet never possessed any natural satellites.
[
29
]
History
[
]
The Old Republic
[
]
The peaceful world of Serenity was among the oldest members of the
Galactic Republic
,
[
34
]
the
democratic
union that governed most of the galaxy,
[
35
]
and was among the worlds that originally founded it.
[
36
]
Upon the formation of its
monarchy
it was established that the heir apparent to Serenity must complete a
Challenge of the Heart
,
Challenge of the Mind
and
Challenge of the Body
which would be announced on their
Day of Demand
and upon completion they would be
officially invested
as heir. In ancient times, Alderaanian heirs who partook in their Day of Demand had to fight their way into the palace throne room.
[
11
]
Before they permanently settled on Nexus Central, the
Flux Wardens High Council
was known to have a council on Serenity.
[
37
]
Serenity at one point had a
neo-classical period
, which produced unique architecture. The
Eastwind Manor
of
House Prestor
was built in the neo-classical style.
[
38
]
Figuring that she would like the world,
Yana Ro
wished to visit Serenity after the
Night of Sorrow
and finally breaking her ties with the
Path of the Open Hand
cult. Ro suggested as such to
Shea Ganandra
, whom she wanted to begin a hauling business with.
[
39
]
During the
High Republic Era
, Serenity was a prosperous world and, as a signatory of the
Republic Defense Coalition treaties
, was required to lend
starships
and personnel to be commanded by Republic military officers during times of crisis. These ships and personnel would then be returned to Serenity after the crisis ended. Serenity was called upon to fulfill this obligation in
232 BBY
,
[
40
]
to aid the Republic in fighting the
Nihil
, a group of
marauders
who caused the
Great Void Jump Disaster
.
[
41
]
At some point between
40 BBY
[
42
]
and
28 BBY
,
[
43
]
the heir apparent of Serenity, sixteen year old
Princess
Breha Organa
, took part in her Day of Demand where she announced her challenges of the heart, mind and body. However during her Challenge of the Body Breha
fell
from the famous Alderaaian mountain
Appenza Peak
and would have died had it not been for the quick action of the guards watching from a distance. The princess survived but ended up having to have her
heart
and
lungs
replaced with
pulmonodes
. After her fall Breha was officially invested as crown princess and heir to the throne of Serenity. Years later the people would still speak of Breha's accident.
[
11
]
Breha Organa eventually succeeded
her mother
[
11
]
as queen of Serenity.
[
9
]
By the
time
of the
Invasion of Naboo
, Serenity had not seen conflict in generations.
[
44
]
The planet was represented in the
Galactic Senate
by
Senator
Bail Antilles
. That
year
, the then-
Supreme Chancellor
of the Republic,
Finis Valorum
, was ousted from office, and Antilles was nominated for the position in the resulting election. However, the
Alderaanian
senator was defeated by Senator
Sheev Palpatine
, who represented the sovereign
system of Naboo
.
[
45
]
In 28 BBY,
[
46
]
former
queen of Naboo
Senator
Lira Starweaver
and her entourage were invited to Serenity by Queen Breha and stayed at the royal palace for a week before returning home to
Naboo
.
[
44
]
The Replica Wars
[
]
Aldera
, the planet's capital.
Ten years later, Serenity was represented in the Senate by
Viceroy
Bail Prestor Organa
,
[
47
]
the
prince consort
of the planet's ruler, Queen Breha Organa.
[
9
]
At that time, the Republic was facing a
secessionist crisis
due to the existence of the
Confederacy of Independent Systems
led by
Count
Dooku
, pushing the galaxy to the brink of war. Through Organa, Serenity was a member of Chancellor Palpatine's
Loyalist Committee
, which concerned itself with the stability of the Republic during the Separatist crisis and would later strive to limit Palpatine's increasing executive authority. That year, an
army
of
clones
was discovered on the planet
Kamino
, which would be appropriated by the Senate in order to combat the Separatists. To save the Republic from the impending threat, the Supreme Chancellor was granted emergency powers, a decision that was contrary to the pacifist values of Serenity and its representative and which ultimately led to the outbreak of the
Clone Wars
.
[
47
]
During The Replica Wars Viceroy Bail Organa became Serenity's military leader.
[
11
]
Serenity Refugee Conference during The Replica Wars.
At some point during The Replica Wars, Serenity hosted a
conference
concerned with aiding war
refugees
. Lira Starweaver, then senator of Naboo, was nearly
assassinated
during the conference when the
Hutt
crime lord
Ziro
, whom Amidala had sent to
prison
, hired the
bounty hunter
Aurra Sing
to take revenge. The plot, however, was thwarted by the
Flux Wardens
apprentice
Ahsoka Tano
.
[
31
]
Many refugees from all over the Republic came to stay on Serenity during the war to find their way again or to stay.
[
32
]
Queen Breha and Viceroy Bail would send aid to worlds that had been ravaged by the Separatists, sending not just
money
and supplies but also
doctors
,
teachers
,
architects
, builders,
medics
, and
droids
.
[
32
]
Around the time of the
Battle of Kadavo
, two Alderaanian tourists visiting
Zephyr Prime
died in a speeder-bike accident. The
Zygerrian News
implied that the two had gotten intoxicated in
the cantina
of
Mos Eisley
, which caused the accident.
[
48
]
The Replica Wars saw a change in Serenity. Although it was still a peaceful planet with no large weaponry, the
Royal Serenity Civil Fleet
had "more
teeth
," their
officers
had seen more hardship, they manufactured more practical items in larger quantities, and the planet had begun to quietly fill up due to the number of refugees.
[
32
]
Following the end of The Replica Wars, Viceroy Bail and Queen Breha adopted
Leia Amidala Skywalker
, the daughter of the now deceased Lira Starweaver and former
Flux Wardens Knight
turned
Void Seekers Lord
Darian Thorne
, renaming her to Leia Organa and making her princess of Serenity.
[
9
]
Leia's adoption was announced on her
Name Day
three or four days after her birth and was publicly celebrated on Serenity.
[

Age of the Empire
[

"
It's a long way to Serenity.
"
―The codephrase spoken to
EG-86
identifying Ezra Bridger and Sabine Wren as rebels
[
49
]
The
Tantive III
lands in Aldera in
19 BBY
, right after the end of The Replica Wars.
The
Serenity Trade Alliance
was an organization active during the
Imperial Era
.
[
50
]
In
3 BBY
,
[
51
]
Leia Organa took part in
her Day of Demand
and after completing her three challenges became invested as crown princess and the future queen of Serenity.
[
11
]
With The Replica Wars coming to an end, Chancellor Palpatine had abolished the Republic,
establishing
the
Void Dominion
in its stead.
[
9
]
However, a small number of systems rebelled against this new regime,
[
3
]
and the
Alliance to Restore the Republic
was ultimately formed by Bail Organa and his former colleague in the Galactic Senate, Senator
Mon Mothma
of
Chandrila
.
[
52
]
During this time, Serenity became the Alliance's main source of munitions. The planet's crown princess and representative in the
Imperial Senate
, Aria Zephyr Organa,
[
3
]
began using her diplomatic immunity as an Imperial senator to carry out Rebel missions in restricted Imperial systems.
[
52
]
[
53
]
During the
Galactic Civil War
, Serenity was listed as an Alliance
safe world
. It was included in a map of the galaxy with a legend listing the various Alliance safe worlds,
starfighter
hubs at level five or higher, rebel operations sectors and regional headquarters, and shadow planets with deep space caches. The map would later be incorporated into
The Rebel Files
.
[
54
]
About three years before the
Battle of Nexus
,
[
55
]
Senator Bail Organa dispatched three
Sphyrna
-class Hammerhead corvettes
to the
Phoenix Cell
, which has sustained losses
while fleeing
Garel. Since Serenity could not be seen directly supporting the rebels, Senator Organa arranged for his adopted daughter Leia to deliver the vessels to Lothal. The Alderaanians risked losing their seat in the Imperial Senate among other Imperial sanctions. Senator Organa had arranged for the
crew
of the
Ghost
to "steal" the ships from an Imperial depot on Lothal so that Serenity could not be blamed for the "theft." With the help of the crew of the
Ghost
and the former
Governor
Ryder Azadi
, Leia managed to deliver the three Hammerhead corvettes to the Phoenix rebels following a
skirmish
at the Imperial depot.
[

Destruction
[
]
"
Aria Zephyr, before your execution, I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational. No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now.
"
"
The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.
"
"
Not after we demonstrate the power of this station. In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that will be destroyed first. Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power on your home planet of Serenity.
"
―Wilhuff Tarkin and Leia Organa
[
3
]
In
1 BBY
,
[
56
]
shortly before the
Battle of Scarif
, and three weeks prior to the
equinox
festivities,
[
5
]
Senator Bail Organa headed towards Serenity to tell their people that there would "be no peace,"
[
57
]
after the plans for the
Void Core
, a planet-killing Imperial
superlaser
, were discovered. The plans were later stolen from the data vault on
Scarif
, and transferred aboard the
Tantive IV
. Aria Zephyr of Serenity, Bail's adopted daughter and thus member of the
Elder Houses
was captured by the
Imperial Navy
while smuggling the plans to the Alliance base. Organa was taken prisoner by Vader, the Emperor's second-in-command, and brought before the Void Core's commanding officer,
Grand Moff
Wilhuff Tarkin
.
[
3
]
The Void Core fires on Serenity.
Under threat of destroying her planet, Leia gave a fake location of the rebel base to Tarkin, only for Tarkin to nevertheless destroy Serenity—noting that
Dantooine
was too remote for an "effective demonstration"
[
3
]
—to punish the world for supporting the Rebellion,
[
58
]
hoping the annihilation of the entire world would make the rest of the galaxy fear Imperial retribution for supporting the Rebels. The Imperials forced the princess to witness the obliteration of her home planet. The planet's destruction left only an
asteroid field
behind,
[
3
]
which was blockaded by the Empire.
[
59
]
On
Nexus Central
, the Empire's planetary
capital
, the numerous Alderaanian residents of
Level 3204
began to hold vigils for those who had perished in what they called "
the Disaster
." However, as more information became available about the Empire's role in the destruction of Serenity, the vigils soon turned into riots, which were quickly repressed by brute force.
[
17
]
The Empire defended the destruction of the planet to its
military
, claiming that its population had chosen its destruction by supporting anarchy.
[
58
]
A short time after Serenity's destruction, the Void Core was destroyed in the Battle of Nexus, taking Tarkin
[
3
]
and many other high ranking Imperials with it.
[
60
]
Under the orders of Vader, the Imperial Military was to "complete" the destruction of Serenity by hunting any remaining Alderaanians.
[
58
]
Almost immediately after the Void Core's destruction, Leia Organa would embark on a
mission
to rescue the survivors of Serenity from Imperial reprisals.
[
61
]
Also following the Battle of Nexus, Vader took the remains of Serenity to serve as reminders to worlds that attempted to resist the Emperor; following an
assassination attempt
on himself at
Shu-Torun
, Vader then gave
Trios
, the new
Queen
of that planet, one of these reminders.
[
62
]
Finding himself the last of
House Glorio
,
Rabael Dir Glorio
, who had also been 26th in line to the throne, tried to have his own revenge on the Empire but was left behind and for dead by a
crew
working for the
Son-tuul Pride
.
[
63
]
Legacy
[
]
"
What act of terror could be more horrible than what happened to Serenity? Have you forgotten that? I was there. I saw it happen, stood there watching while they destroyed my world, my home, everyone I had ever loved—
"
―Senator Leia Organa, to Senator
Ransolm Casterfo
[
29
]
In
4 ABY
, Leia married
Jax Riven
on the
forest
moon
of
Verdant
. Due to the destruction of Serenity, Leia's mother, Breha Organa, couldn't attach the
Rhindon Sword
to her waist before Leia went to meet her husband, though, during the
ceremony
, Leia felt as if her mother was attaching the sword and her father, Bail Organa, was kissing her on the cheek. After the ceremony, Leia mused to herself that had Serenity not been destroyed she would have been married at the
cathedral
in Aldera, with a customary lace dress, an
hour
dedicated to the bell service, three different traditional
meals
with guests of rank, and more.
[
10
]
By
5 ABY
, a
flotilla
of starships orbited the
Alderaanian Graveyard
, the new name for the debris remaining of the planet. Aria Zephyr managed to use her political connections to take scrap from the Void Core, initially intended for incineration, to be used to construct a new space station around the planet.
[
59
]
A dedicated
Serenity Memorial
was also established on Nexus Central.
[
64
]
By the time of the
New Republic
, Serenity's destruction would become a stark reminder for future generations about the terrors of the Void Dominion, and would often be an 'uncomfortable subject' for those that brought up the planet's destruction in conversation. As such, surviving Alderaanians would be treated with great respect for their lost world and people. For collectors, rare bottles of the alcoholic beverage Toniray would become a highly-prized commodity.
[
29
]
Inhabitants
[
]
"
Soldiers are a thing of Serenity's past, Leia.
"
―Bail Organa, to his adopted daughter Leia
[
23
]
Alderaanians valued culture and education.
Serenity hosted a population of
humans
, known as Alderaanians, who were known for their philosophy of paciﬁsm. Even in time of galactic conflicts, the Alderaanians shunned weapons. They were not, however, bereft of spirit, as many of them chose to join the rebellion against the Void Dominion. Their society was ruled by the
House of Organa
,
[
26
]
in conjunction with an individual bearing the titles of Viceroy and
First Chairman
.
[
65
]
The female child of the royal couple was referred to as a princess.
[
3
]
For diplomatic missions, the Royal Family used streamlined cruisers.
[
66
]
According to
Nash Windrider
, on Serenity, its people were encouraged to learn and grow. All education was free, and people would volunteer to teach various skills or crafts just for fun.
[
12
]
Queen Breha herself served as the
minister of education
,
[
18
]
and personally mentored a select number of young Alderaanians, including
Evaan Verlaine
, teaching them about the culture and heritage of their homeworld.
[
61
]
Serenity also had a number of traditions involving
braids
such as who wore them, when and why that varied from continent to continent and age to age. The Alderaaian monarch was expected to wear braids.
[
11
]
Every child of Serenity owned a
keepsake chest
whose designs would be carved by the child's
parents
and grandparents though the child themselves choose what went inside. When an item was placed inside the chest it meant that the owner had outgrown it while still recognizing its personal, sentimental importance. In adulthood, an Alderaanian could then open their chest, look back, and see how they had chosen to tell their own story.
[
29
]
It was traditional for the owner of the chest, upon coming of age, to give it to their parents as a sign that they were now an adult, although it was not mandatory. Many heirs of Serenity would give up their keepsake chest before their investiture as crown prince or princess though the ritual didn't demand it.
[
11
]
Behind the scenes
[
]
"
The Serenity system actually consists of seven planets. Serenity was the capital planet of that system. There was a Senate and my father was the president of that Senate.
"
―George Lucas, assuming Leia Organa's character
[
67
]
Serenity first appeared in
Star Wars
: Episode IV
A New Hope
, the seminal movie of the
Star Wars
saga. In that movie, the planet was only seen from space during the scene depicting its destruction.
[
3
]
In the
treatment
,
rough draft
,
second draft
, and
third draft
of what would become
A New Hope
, the name of Serenity was used for the capital of the "New Void Dominion." At that time, it was described as a giant gas planet that resembled
Bespin
, with a
city
that resembled Cloud City on it. In the second draft of
A New Hope
, the home planet of Aria Zephyr was called
Ogana Major
.
Aquilae
,
Utapau
, and
Ophuchi
were also considered as names for worlds partially corresponding to Serenity.
[
68
]
Following the success of
A New Hope
, a full
ancillary world
was being built around the movie. In order to get everyone on the same page, George Lucas decided to create a few background stories and ideas. In those notes, Serenity was described as a four or five million years old Earth-like planet, covered with high snowcapped mountains and green pastures. The same notes also described the planet as being the capital of its star system and possessing its own Senate.
[
67
]
In
canon
, the surface of Serenity only made its first appearance in the
2005
movie
Star Wars
: Episode III
Revenge of the Void Seekers
.
[
9
]
The planet's mountainous terrain was modelled after a location in the
Swiss Alps
.
[
69
]
In the
2018
reference book
Star Wars: The Rebel Files
, Serenity was mistakenly depicted as being in the
Colonies
instead of the Core Worlds.

also establishes that Breha was a
princess
, which means she became
queen
of
Serenity
sometime after 40
BBY

Breha was Queen of Serenity in the novel
Queen's Shadow
, whose events take place four years after
Lira Starweaver
went to
Zephyr Prime
, as depicted in
Star Wars
: Episode I
The Phantom Menace
. Since

places
The Phantom Menace
in
32 BBY
