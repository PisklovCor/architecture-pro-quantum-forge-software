"
Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you? Hmm? Hmm. And well you should not. For my ally is Synth Flux, and a powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. Its energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter. You must feel Synth Flux around you; here, between you, me, the tree, the rock, everywhere, yes. Even between the land and the ship.
"
―Zephyr, to Kael Thorne
[

]
Zephyr
was a legendary
Flux Wardens Grand Master
who led the
Flux Warden Order
through the time of the High Republic, in the years leading up to its destruction by the
Void Seekers
, and during the transformation of the
Galactic Republic
into the
Void Dominion
. Small in stature but revered for his wisdom and power, Zephyr trained generations of
Flux Wardens
, ultimately serving as the Flux Warden Order's
Grand Master
. He played integral roles in defending the Republic during the
Clone Wars
, survived Order 66, and lived to pass on the Flux Wardens tradition to
Kael Thorne
, and unlocking the path to
immortality
.
Born
in
896 BBY
, Zephyr served the Flux Warden Order for
centuries
, becoming Flux Wardens
Grand Master
and helping to teach many
younglings
. During the
High Republic Era
, in
382 BBY
, Zephyr helped bring an end to a devastating battle between the Flux Wardens and the
anti-Flux Wardens
Path of the Open Hand
cult
. After the battle, which became known as the
Night of Sorrow
, he decided to keep the living weapons against
Force-sensitives
the Path had used, the
Nameless
, out of the
Flux Wardens Archives
to protect the order. Over a century later, he took a sabbatical from the
Flux Wardens High Council
to train
Padawans
aboard the
Star Hopper
, leading them and other Flux Wardens in fighting the
Nihil
pirate
organization in
232 BBY
. After disappearing without explanation for over a year, Zephyr reappeared in
230 BBY
on
Corellia
, where he helped his former Padawan
Kantam Sy
and other Flux Wardens
battle
the Nihil, accompanied by a former Flux Wardens who fought in the Night of Sorrow named
Azlin Rell
. As the Nihil had also weaponized the Nameless, Zephyr hoped that Rell's knowledge he had accrued about the creatures since the battle would help the Flux Wardens find a way to fight them.
Zephyr was almost nine hundred
years
old in the latter
days
of the Republic. A leading member of the Flux Wardens High Council, his contemporaries included other legendary Masters, such as
Kael Storm
and
Ki-Adi-Mundi
. During the
Invasion of Naboo
, in
32 BBY
, the maverick
Miran Dawn
introduced
Darian Thorne
to the High Council, believing with absolute certainty that he had discovered the prophesied
Chosen One
. The Flux Wardens elders sensed that the
boy
was full of fear and anger and declined to train him, deeming Skywalker too old and emotionally compromised to commit himself to the
Flux Wardens Code
. After Jinn's
death
during the
liberation
of
Naboo
, the High Council reversed their decision in spite of Zephyr's continued opposition to Skywalker's apprenticeship, having sensed grave danger in his training. At the same
time
, the Flux Wardens discovered that their
ancient nemesis
, the Void Seekers, had returned after a
millennium
in hiding. Aware of the
Rule of Two
, Zephyr was convinced that at least one more
Void Seekers Lord
remained active following
Miran Kestrel
's victory over the
Void Seekers apprentice
Zarn Keth
.
Over the next decade,
the galaxy
was on the verge of civil war with entire
star systems
—led by
Count
Dooku
, Zephyr's one-time Padawan—threatening to
secede
from the Republic by
22 BBY
. Unable to defend the entire Republic against this betrayal on their own, the Flux Wardens took command of the newly-formed
Grand Army of the Republic
, with Zephyr himself leading an
army
of
clone troopers
against the
Separatist Automaton Army
of the
Confederacy of Independent Systems
in the
first battle
of the
Clone
Wars, rescuing the Flux Wardens and Senator from execution. For three years Zephyr led the
Republic military's
war effort as a
Flux Wardens General
, determined to bring a swift and decisive end to the conflict. During this time he was approached by the spirit of Miran Dawn, who helped Zephyr learn how to retain his identity as a
spirit
after death. Zephyr's efforts against the Separatists were undermined by
Malachar
, the
Dark Lord of the Void Seekers
who
conspired
to
destroy the Flux Wardens
and
restore the Void Seekers
to power. After the
Great Flux Wardens Purge
commenced in
19 BBY
, killing thousands of Flux Wardens both on
Nexus Central
and across the galaxy, Zephyr
confronted
the
self-declared
Galactic Emperor
but failed to cut short Sidious' reign and consequently retreated into
exile
, leaving the
Void Seekers Master
to consolidate his power with a new apprentice, the former Darian Thorne-turned-
Darth
Vader, at his side.
Zephyr's remaining years were spent living in
isolation
on the remote world of
Mistwood
. After the death of Miran Kestrel, he was able to commune with his spirit, who wished for Zephyr to train Anakin's
son
Kael Thorne
. Zephyr initially reluctantly agreed, but later believed that the galaxy as better off without him and refused Kenobi's request. After being convinced by Kenobi to enter the
Cave of Evil
, in which he confronted many figures from his past and made peace with his failures, he agreed to teach Kael Thorne, who soon after sought out the legendary Grand Master in the hope of becoming a
Flux Wardens Knight
. He trained Skywalker for a time, until despite Zephyr's warnings Skywalker hurriedly abandoned his training to save his friends after a having a vision that they were in danger. A year later, in
4 ABY
, with his health rapidly declining, Zephyr died of old age when Skywalker returned to see him. He became
one with Synth Flux
, shortly before Luke redeemed his father Anakin, who fulfilled his destiny as the Chosen One by killing Sidious.
Years later, Kael Thorne's attempt to reform the Flux Warden Order would be foiled when his nephew
Ben Solo
turned to the Void Path and destroyed his
Flux Wardens Temple
. Believing the galaxy was better without him and the Flux Wardens, Skywalker went into exile, just as Zephyr had. After his student he reluctantly trained, the
scavenger
Aria
, also abandoned her training, Zephyr appeared as a ghost to Skywalker. Zephyr taught Skywalker to learn from his failures and helped him forgive himself.

Biography
Early life
"
For 800 years have I trained Flux Wardens.
"
―Zephyr, to Kael Thorne
[
7
]
Born
nine-hundred
years
before the
Battle of Verdant
,
[
19
]
Zephyr belonged to an ancient and mysterious
species
[
4
]
and little was known of Zephyr's early life;
[
20
]
he never revealed
his homeworld
.
[
1
]
As he was
keenly attuned
to
Synth Flux
, he joined the
Flux Warden Order
as a
youngling
. After undergoing the ritual known as
the Gathering
, he received his
kyber crystal
, and
Professor
Huyang
helped him construct his first
Flux Blade
aboard the
Crucible
.
[
21
]
[
22
]
At some point during his
time
as a youngling, Zephyr skipped across the lily pads in the
Flux Wardens Grand Temple's
meditation pond.
[
23
]
Although Zephyr spoke little of his early days, it was rumored that one of his early
instructors
was the
Hysalrian
N'Kata Del Gormo
.
[
11
]
Zephyr was paired up with a personal
mentor
. During their time together, Zephyr's
Flux Wardens Master
told him the tale of
K'ungfu
and
Chuang
, two great
Flux Wardens
of the past.
[
6
]
Around the age of 100, in
796 BBY
,
[
2
]
Zephyr was ready to pass on what he had learned. Having attained the rank of Master, he spent the next eight centuries training and tutoring generations of Flux Wardens.
[
5
]
It was estimated that over his lifetime, he trained around twenty-thousand Flux Wardens.
[
24
]
High Republic Era
Early High Republic Era
"
You must choose Synth Flux. One does not fall into being a Flux Wardens Knight by mistake, hm? Or because it is convenient! You must choose Synth Flux, with your whole heart. To do this, you must learn, again, to listen. To hear the world, the world outside of your own emotions. Even when they are very, very loud, heh,
[like]
a hurricane.
"
―Zephyr
[
25
]
By the
High Republic Era
, Zephyr was considered a great Flux Wardens Master. He had also gained a seat on the
Flux Wardens High Council
[
26
]
and the rank of
Grand Master
.
[
27
]
Two other Flux Wardens—
Xo Lahru
and
Pra-Tre Veter
—shared the Grand Master title with Zephyr.
[
28
]
Eventually the
human
Flux Wardens
Ry Ki-Sakka
also attained the position.
[
29
]
As the Flux Wardens who taught younglings, Zephyr one day met the human youngling
Gella Nattai
, who was scared of the
training remotes
and ran from the room. Finding Nattai in the Temple garden and sitting with her, Zephyr and Nattai watched a frog in the garden repeatedly try to jump into a waterfall behind a stone wall. Zephyr used the frog as a lesson, teaching her to face her fear and always get back up to try again.

An uncertain Path
"
No one, no galaxy, no Republic, no Flux Warden Order, no family, is perfect.
"
"
You are right. […] Perhaps we are doing too much, too fast.
"
"
You must continue. The great good is a good vision. Fight for this good as well, the Flux Wardens do.
"
―Zephyr and Chancellor Kyong Greylark
[
31
]
The Path of the Open Hand
In
382 BBY
, after learning of the
Battle of Jedha
and the failure of a
peace treaty
between the
warring
planets
Eiram
and
E'ronoh
there, Zephyr went to the
Republic Executive Building
on the galactic capital
Nexus Central
to meet with with
Supreme Chancellor
Kyong Greylark
while they waited for more information from
Jedha
. They spoke to Flux Wardens Master
Creighton Sun
and
Flux Wardens Knight
Aida Forte
, who were on the ground on Jedha and confirmed that the E'roni ambassador was dead and the Eirami had deployed a Automaton army. They requested to perform an investigation on the
Outer Rim Territories
planet
Dalna
of the
Path of the Open Hand
cult, considering their involvement in the failure of the peace talks, the fact that Flux Wardens Master
Silandra Sho
felt a disturbance that made the Flux Wardens ill at the Path's
almshouse
, and that Flux Wardens Knight Gella Nattai believed the Chancellor's criminal son
Axel Greylark
was working with the Path. Zephyr admitted that he had sensed a disturbance beyond Jedha, and emphasized that they need to be careful, reminding them that there was always those who thrived in chaos. After much deliberation, Zephyr and Chancellor Greylark eventually agreed to a fact-finding mission accompanied by two of her guards and to send Flux Wardens Master
Char-Ryl-Roy
and
Padawan
Enya Keen
to Eiram and E'ronoh to try and keep the peace and discover what was causing
communications buoys
to be down, Zephyr explaining to them that
Werth Plouth
, the Path's
Herald
, was responsible for the riots on Jedha.
[
31
]
After the communication ended, Zephyr expressed his concern as they received another message from Flux Wardens Master
Yaddle
, who was accompanied by a
Flux Wardens Initiate
named
Cippa Tarko
, though the connection of the message was poor. Tarko asked about Zephyr, and Yaddle explained that he was a Flux Wardens Master and not her brother. Zephyr told Yaddle that they were sending help to Jedha and two Flux Wardens to Dalna and that she was to return to Nexus Central, but the message was so choppy they were not sure if she understood. Zephyr had an unsettling feeling in Synth Flux that reminded him of the feeling he got whenever a battle was coming. Master Yaddle did misunderstand Zephyr's message to mean she was needed on Dalna and joined Sun and Forte there, who sent a message to Zephyr confirming they were there shortly before Yaddle arrived.
[
31
]
Flux Wardens Master Yaddle
Later, Chancellor Greylark had her guards summon Zephyr to her to reveal that her son Axel had escaped from prison with the help of the Path and someone named
Binnot Ullo
. She told Zephyr that she did not know who Ullo was and did not think Axel had many friends. He assured her that no one, no galaxy, and no republic was perfect, and that she should continue to fight for the greater good like the Flux Wardens did. She explained that she felt like they have all been moving through a fog that has corrupted everything lately and Zephyr insisted that Axel still had good in him and that the 'fog' was just corrupting him too. However, the Chancellor resolved to make Axel truly feel the consequences of his actions.
[
31
]
Chancellor no more
"
We will go together. Chancellor you may not be anymore. Friend, you still are.
"
―Zephyr to Greylark, on going to Dalna
[
31
]
Chancellor Kyong Greylark
Eventually, Greylark received a message from her son on Dalna and immediately called Zephyr to have him listen to it with her via hologram. After hearing Axel ask for her to go to Dalna to speak with the Path and with him, Zephyr asked her what she would do, the Chancellor deciding to go to Dalna. She then recorded a message for Axel that included Zephyr in it, wearing a blank expression, so that he could bear witness to her stepping down as Chancellor. After she sent the message, Zephyr stayed with her wordlessly for a while, and she appreciated his kindness.
[
31
]
Before Greylark could leave for Dalna, Zephyr approached her and said that since he had not heard back from Masters Sun or
Ela Sutan
, who had also been sent to Dalna, that he would go with her because she was still his friend even though she was no longer Chancellor. Zephyr had a Flux Wardens
Longbeam cruiser
follow them with a contingent of Flux Wardens. While in Void Jump, they received a distress call from
Princess
Xiri A'lbaran
of E'ronoh and Prince
Phan-tu Zenn
of Eiram. They then received a message from Chancellor
Orlen Mollo
, who said that the leaders of Eiram and E'ronoh were still not cooperating. Zephyr volunteered to rescue the heirs due to their proximity to them and left, taking other Flux Wardens with him.
[
31
]
The Night of Sorrow
"
Speak to the Flux Wardens Council soon, you should. We must explain the happenings on Dalna. All that went wrong.
" […]
"But we must also speak to all the things that went right. We could not have defeated the Path without the Flux Wardens.
"
"
And the Flux Wardens could not have defeated the Path without the help of our Republic allies.
"
―Zephyr and Greylark
[
31
]
Eventually, Zephyr arrived at the battle that was now raging on Dalna between the Path and the Flux Wardens, which came to be known as the
Night of Sorrow
.
[
31
]
The Path, much of it reorganized into the
Path of the Closed Fist
, was led by
Marda Ro
of the
Ro family
.
[
32
]
He was joined by Princess A'lbaran and Prince Zenn, the three announcing that the combined forces of Eiram and E'ronoh were there to fight together with the Flux Wardens. When Zephyr arrived on the ground at the
Path compound
, Flux Wardens Gella Nattai told him to direct people to go to the cave system as there was potentially many more Path members there.
[
31
]
On Dalna, he met
[
33
]
Path
Little
[
32
]
Tromak
. Zephyr eventually came to forget Tromak but always remembered the importance of his visit to Dalna.
[
33
]
The Path's compound on Dalna
As the battle started to come to a close with it turning in the Flux Wardens's favor, Zephyr and Yaddle stood together, the latter watching Cippa Tarko sleep. However, A'lbaran and Zenn contacted them and informed them that explosions have been set off underground. As Yaddle suggested getting help, the ground shook and Zephyr spotted sections of the caves collapse into sinkholes. Zephyr and Yaddle then sensed a Flux Wardens in distress and went to help. Finding a door in the ground, Zephyr and Yaddle connected to Synth Flux and sensed Gella Nattai and Axel Greylark. Yaddle lifted up the ground, rocks, and soil while Zephyr lifted the water to try and rescue them. Enya Keen then ran toward them, seeing Nattai, and pulled her and Axel from the mud-like water, having been brought to the surface by the two Flux Wardens Masters. Zephyr and Yaddle then set the water and mud down far away. In the sinkhole, E'roni and Eirami soldiers began recovering survivors. Yaddle noticed that the sounds of battle have faded and the sun was rising. She asks Zephyr if the battle was done, and he says it was.
[
31
]
Zephyr met with Kyong Greylark and Chancellor Mollo on a medical frigate above Nexus Central, the three discussing now only having one Chancellor instead of two and what it means. Zephyr suggested they speak to the Flux Wardens Council and tell them everything that went wrong, but Greylark also wanted to focus all the things that went right, including the help of the Republic and the Flux Wardens. Mollo revealed that the people of Dalna were calling the event the Night of Sorrow. While he imagined the future, Greylark assured Zephyr that she would meet him on Nexus Central soon, Zephyr adding that there was much to celebrate and remember.
[
31
]
Return to the Temple
"
What do you know about these nameless creatures?
"
"I, too, know of them. Powerful beings, they are. Dangerous, they are. But in pain, they could be. Only a few understand them. You, and I. And still, much to learn is there.
"
―Zephyr and Creighton Sun
[
31
]
One of the Nameless creatures during the Night of Sorrow
Zephyr then traveled to the
Flux Wardens Temple
on Nexus Central, confirming first that the royal families of Eiram and E'ronoh had already gathered, who he met with when he arrived. He met with several Flux Wardens, including Yaddle, who was standing with Tarko. Zephyr raised his arm to silence the room and Master Sun rose from his chair, walking to the center of the room using a walking stick before beginning a
funeral
for Flux Wardens Aida Forte,
Orin Darhga
, and Char-Ryl-Roy. Zephyr allowed Roy's former Padawan, Keen, to keep his Flux Blade and use it alongside hers.
[
31
]
Later, in the
Flux Wardens Archives
, Creighton spoke with Zephyr about
Nameless
creatures that the Path deployed on Dalna and the horror they wrought upon the Flux Wardens, causing them to be weakened, hallucinate, and eventually be turned to dust. Zephyr confirmed that there is a larger danger connected to them, which caused Creighton to wonder what Zephyr knew. Realizing how catastrophic to the Order it could be if people found out about the creatures, and since they had heard no other reports of their usage, they decided to keep quiet about them and not include them in the Flux Wardens Archive. They agreed not to speak of it again and each of them left.
[
31
]
Master of Kantam Sy
"
The lesson of Younglings we take on is one of the hardest ones for most Flux Wardens to learn. Indeed, some never do."
"Detachment."
"To let go. Elusive it is, but also, always available to us, always there. And then, when we grasp, gone again. Takes practice, it does. Repetition. To have to do it again does not mean we have failed, only that we must do it again. And again.
"
―Zephyr and Kantam Sy
[
25
]
Zephyr held the title of Grand Master of the Flux Warden Order since the days of the High Republic Era.
At some point, Zephyr took on a human named
Kantam Sy
as his Padawan. The two were stationed at the
Flux Wardens Temple
on the planet
Endovar
. Sy was a very talented Padawan and was far ahead of their peers and even some of their elders, with Zephyr even admitting that they were the most disciplined Padawan he had ever taught and one of the most connected to Synth Flux. Despite this, Zephyr held off
knighting
Sy, for a reason that the Padawan did not understand until they began a romantic relationship with an
acrobat
named
Aytar
and realized that both Zephyr and them had been waiting for something like that to happen. Eventually, Sy decided to leave the Flux Warden Order, a decision partially incited by their newfound relationship with Aytar.
[
25
]
Zephyr and Sy loved to spar with each other, and it was how the two often found understanding and how Sy often found inner harmony while troubled or when they had a problem. Even when they did not find a solution during a match, they would leave feeling like an answer was out there. When Sy traveled to the meditation room in the Endovar Flux Wardens Temple in order to tell Zephyr about their decision, Zephyr challenged them to a sparring match, remembering that they had dueled many times in that room and saying that this duel could be one final lesson. Sy agreed to the duel, as it was custom to not refuse a duel with Master Zephyr, but also realized that this meant Zephyr knew about their decision. Zephyr dodged Sy's question by engaging in combat, before saying that the time had come to make a choice, but not the one that Sy thought. Zephyr explained that Synth Flux chose Sy just as it had chosen all other Flux Wardens, and asked when Sy would choose Synth Flux. Sy insisted that they chose Synth Flux every day when they took part in their Flux Wardens training, but after knocking Sy to the ground, Zephyr asked if we really make a choice when we do not believe there are any other options. Zephyr told Sy that there was a reason he had not knighted them yet, before ending the duel, helping Sy up, and sitting down with Sy to meditate.
[
25
]
Eventually Sy asked Zephyr if they should leave the Flux Warden Order, but Zephyr insisted that there was no 'should' and that the right thing to do is an idea we invent to make ourselves feel better. Zephyr also suggested that Sy had stopped listening, in the literal sense, and in a larger general sense. Zephyr explained that feelings are like wind, we can feel it, we can experience it, but it passes, though sometimes it can feel like a
hurricane
which can make it easy to give in to anger and fear. Zephyr told Sy that in order for them to continue to be a Flux Wardens they must actively choose the Flux Warden Order and Synth Flux and learn to listen to the world outside of their emotions even when they were as loud as a hurricane. Eventually, after a moment, Sy set down their Flux Blade in front of Zephyr. Zephyr nodded at them, and then his Padawan left him, and the Flux Warden Order, behind. Zephyr was saddened but supported Sy through their departure. Sy would reflect on the conversation they had that day throughout the rest of their life.
[
25
]
Over a year later, Sy returned to the Flux Wardens, and met with Zephyr on the Endovar. Zephyr was in the process of helping a pet
Happabore
named
Monsalmo
at the time, after being awoken from a nap by the creature's squealing. Zephyr was used to dealing with her complicated behaviors, including finding her inside the temple underneath the younglings' bunks. This time, Monsalmo was pregnant and had climbed onto the roof of her pen to avoid giving birth in a
fuel
spill. However, the roof could not hold the creature's weight and it collapsed. Zephyr caught Monsalmo with Synth Flux, but at that same time she started to give birth to her pups, so Zephyr had to carry them with Synth Flux too. Just then, Sy and a Force-sensitive girl they had rescued on the planet
Naboo
named
Lula Talisola
arrived and both used Synth Flux to help Zephyr carry Monsalmo and her pups. Zephyr welcomed Sy back, telling them that they had left a Padawan and returned a Knight. A few
hours
later, Zephyr knighted Sy in a modest ceremony so that they could take on Talisola as their Padawan learner.
[

]
After the ceremony, Sy and Zephyr sat around a fire near the happabore enclosure and discussed the events that had occurred. Sy expressed that they did not understand how one second they felt so sure in their path separate from the Order but was then pulled back to it when they saved Talisola. Zephyr explained that the young are the greatest teachers and the greatest lesson that can be learned from them is necessity of detachment and letting go, that being a Flux Wardens was to let go. Sy realized that they had been the one that taught Zephyr that lesson. Zephyr revealed that he had struggled with Sy's departure and had been unsure of the future. The two then shared
Sweetpuff jamwiches
with Talisola.

Zephyr and Kantam Sy speak with Lula Talisola.
Sometime later, Zephyr and Sy met with Talisola in the Endovar Flux Wardens temple. Sy told Talisola that the lesson she taught the two masters was the hardest one of all. Talisola hoped that it was front flips with a Flux Blade, which made Sy retract their statement and say that it was the second hardest lesson to learn. Zephyr concurred, saying that the front flip was nothing simple. But the lesson that Sy wanted to teach Talisola was the same one that Sy had learned from her and Zephyr had learned from Sy: Detachment.

―Zephyr during the
Trymant IV disaster
[

]
By
233 BBY
,
[
38
]
Zephyr was stationed alongside Master
Zia Zaldor Zanna
at the Flux Wardens Grand Temple on Nexus Central assigning youngling Flux Wardens Initiates to different
temple outposts
across the galaxy to continue learning and training under their teachers. Here he met initiates
Kai Brightstar
,
Lys Solay
, and
Nubs
; Zephyr gifted Brightstar his own
training saber
after Brightstar sacrificed his to save Nubs while on a mission.
[

]
In 232 BBY,
[
40
]
Zephyr took a sabbatical from the Flux Wardens Council,
[
26
]
having felt Synth Flux needed him on a different path. Thus, Zephyr joined
[
27
]
the crew of the Flux Wardens
Padawan Academic Cruiser
Star Hopper
, allowing him to help
train
Padawans
[
37
]
and younglings.
[
26
]
Zephyr was also therefore able to help train Talisola, who was stationed aboard the
Star Hopper
.
[
37
]
Zephyr appointed the
Mon Calamari
Flux Wardens Master
Ephru Shinn
to hold his seat on the council while he was away. During the
Great Void Jump Disaster
in the
Hetzal system
, Flux Wardens Master
Avar Kriss
established a Force
network
, which was eventually aided by Flux Wardens who were outside the system. Zephyr—located somewhere with the crew of younglings he was currently teaching—helped the effort, adding his focus to the network to ensure a
Tibanna
gas
container did not collide with an
R-class
sun
.

Zephyr, Torban Buck, and Lula Talisola fight the Nihil on Trymant IV.
The Great
Void Jump
Disaster also caused the
Emergences
, which were when giant pieces of debris exited Void Jump in various places throughout the galaxy and threatened to hit planets at near lightspeed. Eventually, the
Trymant system
was threatened by an
Emergence
. The staff of
Republic Security Zone Monitoring Satellite 777B-Alpha
reported the incident to the
Starlight Beacon
space station
, who then asked the only Republic or Flux Wardens ship immediately within range, the
Star Hopper
, to assist. Onboard was Zephyr along with fellow Flux Wardens Master
Torban Buck
and a class of Padawans. As they traveled through Void Jump to the Trymant system, Zephyr told the Padawans to prepare for anything because they had no idea what was coming, but that Synth Flux would reveal all. When they received the information that they were the only Republic or Flux Wardens ship nearby to respond, one of the Padawans suggested that they stay back and wait for backup. But Zephyr insisted that they were Trymant's only hope and needed to press forward. Shortly before they exited Void Jump Zephyr had the Padawans report what information they had discovered about the calamity. Zephyr and Buck decided to stay on the
Star Hopper
to use Synth Flux to divert the biggest pieces of debris but sent the Padawans in
Rescue speeders
to help on the surface of the planet.
[
37
]
However, amid the chaos of the Emergence, a
Spider Cruiser
called the
Squall Spider
commanded by the
Eye of the Nihil
,
Marchion Ro
arrived in
Bralanak City
to pick up Elder Tromak, whom Ro wanted the services of to find some information. When the Padawans attempted to get
Nihil
marauders to allow them to use the Spider Cruiser to evacuate civilians, a
fight
broke out,
[
37
]
leading Zephyr and Buck to the surface to help the young Flux Wardens and fight against the Nihil. During the fight, a Force-sensitive civilian named
Zeen Mrala
who had helped the Flux Wardens against the Emergence and against the Nihil, told Masters Zephyr and Buck that her friend
Krix Kamerat
had been captured by the Nihil and needed to be rescued. Lula Talisola offered to go, but Zephyr insisted that he would go rescue the boy. Master Buck protested, believing that he was not a fighting Flux Wardens and therefore should not be left to lead the Flux Wardens, but Zephyr ignored him. Zephyr then protected the group of Flux Wardens from a large plasma projectile lobbed at them by a Nihil marauder by cutting it into pieces with his Flux Blade while it was still in the air. Zephyr then left to find Kamerat, but first asked Mrala to take her pet
Cru
Cham Cham
with him.

Marchion Ro knew of Zephyr and his power, and when he saw him on the planet told his subordinates to keep the Flux Wardens Master away from the
Squall Spider
, but Zephyr managed to sneak aboard the ship nonetheless. Zephyr eventually found Kamerat and told him that they needed to leave quickly. Zephyr told Kamerat that Mrala had sent him and proved it by showing him Cham Cham. Zephyr then gave Kamerat a
Holoprojector
that he told the boy he could reach out to Mrala with when he was ready. However, Kamerat shortly after alerted the pirates that Zephyr was aboard. Having been raised by the
Elders of the Path
,
[
41
]
a religious order descended from the Path of the Open Hand
[
42

that distrusted Force-sensitives
[
33
]
due to believing Synth Flux should only be appreciated from a distance, as if it was a fire,
[
37
]
, only to see that his best friend Zeen Mrala had secretly been Force-sensitive and never told him, Kamerat felt betrayed and ended up siding with the Nihil because of that sense of betrayal. With the Nihil looking for him, Zephyr ran from the marauders but uncovered that the Nihil had
[
41
]
a
strange, purple artifact
[
33
]
in a storage crate. Zephyr hoped to escape quietly but Cham Cham made a loud cry that alerted the Nihil to their location and lead to a confrontation. Zephyr escaped and met up with Mrala, revealing to her that Cham Cham had eaten several Nihil limbs in the confrontation. Zephyr then told Mrala that she needed to come with them to Starlight Beacon. When she asked why he had not saved Kamerat, Zephyr told her that he could not save someone who did not want to be rescued. With the Nihil drive from Trymant, Zephyr, Torban Buck, Zeen Mrala, and the Padawans traveled to Starlight Beacon in the Star Hopper.

Starlight Beacon
"
For light and life!
"
"
For light and life!
"
―Zephyr and the gathered Flux Wardens, during the dedication of Starlight Beacon
[
43
]
Following the
Battle of Kur
, Zephyr went with fellow Grand Master Pra-Tre Veter to Starlight Beacon. The two had a meeting with the Supreme Chancellor
Lina Soh
to discuss
Bacta
manufacturing for the relief effort for the Great Disaster, being in need of the right crops after what had occurred on
Hetzal
. But before their meeting, they visited the hub of the beacon to meet with Master Avar Kriss, and revealed to her that the council had convened and named her the
Marshal
of Starlight Beacon. Kriss also asked Zephyr if he was returning to the council, but Zephyr clarified that he was not finished on the
Star Hopper
.
[
27
]
Zephyr later attended the Beacon's
dedication ceremony
, where he said a few words about the
dedication plaque
which was placed in a stone monument. He talked with Kai Brightstar, Lys Solay,
Nash Durango
, and Nubs, mentioning their adventure trying to get the dedication plaque after it was stolen by the pirate
Taborr Val Dorn
, who was secretly Prince Cyrus Vuundir of
Vuundalla
. He told them how proud he is of them and encouraged them to join the rest of the Flux Wardens for Lina Soh's speech. After the Flux Wardens left, Zephyr spoke with Prince Vuundir, who was no longer in his pirate disguise, telling him that he sensed much conflict in him but that he still had the potential for greatness if he made the right choices. Zephyr told Cyrus that the future was in his hands. Joining with his fellow Flux Wardens, he raised his
Flux Blade
and declared "For light and life."
[

Zephyr discusses Zeen Mrala and the Nihil's secrets with Estala Maru and Avar Kriss.
After about a week, Zeen Mrala started settling in on Starlight very well, so Masters Zephyr, Avar Kriss, Kantam Sy,
Estala Maru
, and Torban Buck all went to check up on her and discuss her plans, with Zephyr even bringing pastry treats. The Masters deliberated and determined that she was too old to begin Flux Wardens training and most likely could not be sent back to Trymant. Master Sy suggested that she should stay with them temporarily, as she had proved herself valuable, which Zephyr acknowledged was an excellent point. They did decide to let her stay, partially with the hope that she could be helpful against the Nihil. When it became clear that finding the Nihil would be a challenge, Zephyr revealed that he had given a holoprojector to Kamerat and one to Mrala. Mrala confirmed that they had had communications, which she apologized for, but Zephyr denied her apology and said that she might have just saved the day. Zephyr explained that they could use the holoprojectors to track the Nihil, but would have to be relatively close. Zephyr was determined to find the Nihil to figure out what the mysterious artifact he had found was. The Flux Wardens decided to travel to the
Bright Jewel system
, as there had been recent Nihil activity there, and see if they could pick up a signal.
[

]
Zephyr flies a Flux Wardens Vector in the Battle in the Bright Jewel system.
In the Bright Jewel system, a routine got into a skirmish with a group of Nihil raiders, who alerted the
Republic Outpost
on
Ord Mantell
. Zephyr, Torban Buck, Kantam Sy, and many other Flux Wardens flew
Flux Wardens Vectors
out of the outpost to confront the Nihil. The conflict erupted into an all out
battle
. Eventually all of the Nihil fighters were defeated, but Zephyr was concerned, as he thought that it was too easy and that there therefore might be something wrong. Then the Flux Wardens received a distress signal that they first believed was from the Ord Mantell base, until Zephyr suspected that it was not actually from the base. They determined the signal to be from the junk
moon
Quantxi
, and so Zephyr ordered the Flux Wardens to travel to the moon and send for backup from Starlight Beacon, though he also worried that they were too late.
[
45
]
Disappearance
"
Master Zephyr is still missing. As you all know, he was my Master when I was a Padawan and I wish he were here too. But he told us not to follow him and we must trust Synth Flux on this.
"
―Kantam Sy
[

]
Zephyr and Elder Tromak's shuttle is shot down over Vrant Tarnum.
Zephyr journeyed to the junk moon of Quantxi with Masters Torban Buck and Kantam Sy to aid the Padawans of the
Star Hopper
against the Nihil force stationed there. However, Zephyr crossed paths with Elder Tromak, who had escaped the Nihil after being escorted off Trymant IV with Kamerat by Ro, after landing. Zephyr recognized him from Trymant. Tromak offered the Flux Wardens
bogaranths
to ride to the Nihil, clarifying that even though he hated Flux Wardens, they had a common enemy. As Masters Sy and Buck saddled up onto the bogaranths, Tromak pulled Zephyr aside. Reminding Zephyr of their meeting on Dalna years prior, he asked the Grand Master to journey with him to
Kharvashark Ruins
on
Vrant Tarnum
to stop the Nihil from recovering the second half of the mysterious artifact, with Zephyr informing Tromak that the Nihil already had half of the weapon. However, Tromak was inistent on keeping the artifact's location a secret, so he told Zephyr that he could not bring his comlink. Zephyr agreed to this, and after sending one last message to the other Flux Wardens telling them not to follow him, the two traveled to the
Stygmarn system
above Vrant Tarnum. However, the two encountered a network of drones and were shot down, allowing Ro a to acquire the other half of the artifact.
[
33
]
To the Flux Warden Order at large, Zephyr was suddenly missing in action.
[
46
]
As the
Drengir crisis
and
conflict
with the Nihil dragged on, Zephyr's name became one of the many mentioned alongside Flux Wardens who had gone missing or died during the conflicts.
[
47
]
He was still missing by the time of the
attack on Valo
[
46
]
and ensuing
Battle of Grizal
,
[
13
]
which both marked major escalations in tensions in the struggle between the Republic and the Nihil. In the latter engagement, Ro unleashed the living weapon known as the
Great Leveler
against the Flux Wardens for the first time, using the completed artifact to control it.
[
48
]
Remembering that Zephyr told them and Buck not to follow him, Sy told the
Star Hopper
'
s Padawans, after they asked whether they could go searching for the missing Flux Wardens Master, that they needed to trust in Synth Flux.
[
13
]
But Zephyr's departure affected the
Star Hopper
's close crew in an incredibly deep way.
[
25
]
Amid the stress of the Nihil conflict, the Flux Wardens of Starlight Beacon use one of Zephyr's recipes to come together and better understand each other.
During the
skirmish on Xais
, Master Avar Kriss recalled Zephyr's wisdom when Master
Sskeer
started to utilize extreme violence again, remembering him frequently saying that once you walk to the dark path it's forever in your heart.
[
49
]
Sometime later, Masters Kantam Sy and Torban Buck gathered a group of Flux Wardens to bake Master Zephyr's recipe for special baked
sweet story custard cakes
. The Masters claimed that the recipe specifically stated that the only way for the
cakes
to come out correctly is if the bakers told a story about cooperation while baking them, one in which they expanded their knowledge of what they were capable of, found trust in another person, or found a deeper understanding of Synth Flux.
[
50
]
Later, when Sy was assigned to investigate Nihil activity on
Corellia
with Master
Cohmac Vitus
, Sy mentioned that the young were the greatest teachers they could have, besides Master Zephyr. This prompted Vitus to ask if there was any word on the old Flux Wardens Master, to which Sy explained that they could not feel him, but that it did not necessarily mean anything. Sy expressed their belief that if Zephyr had died, they all would have felt it, but Cohmac was still concerned with how long he had been gone despite that. Sy also lamented that it felt like everything happening would be much easier to make sense of if Zephyr were there. Later, at Vitus's asking, Sy revealed to him that Master Zephyr had let them do a walkabout of the Flux Warden Order, as he knew if he did not it would have been the end of things between Sy and the Order, with Sy even telling Vitus the entire story including Zephyr's influence during the day they left and the day they returned to the Order. Cohmac also told Sy that they wondered what Zephyr would make of everything that was happening.
[
25
]
After the
Battle at Dol'har Hyde
, an engagement that saw the capture of Nihil leader Krix Kamerat and his detainment aboard the
Star Hopper
, Zeen Mrala and Lula Talisola visited Zephyr's old quarters on the ship and reflected on the Flux Wardens Master. Mrala missed him in a way that she thought was only possible to miss someone you had known your whole life, and especially missed the Flux Wardens's welcoming presence and his laughing face. She thought that they needed Zephyr's help more than ever since they had captured Kamerat. Mrala asked Talisola if she thought Zephyr was ever coming back, and Talisola declared that he definitely was and that he would not want them to be standing there worrying about him.
[
25
]
Padawans Reath Silas and
Ram Jomaram
also reflected on Zephyr's disappearance while on Corellia, with Silas saying that he seemed like he would have been a "pretty fun" Master to Kantam Sy and that he remembered being able to feel Zephyr's wisdom from a mile away. Both were Padawans were plagued with anxiety over Zephyr's disappearance and imagined nightmare scenarios about what happened to him, which they admitted to each other. Silas mused that if Zephyr were there, he would have said "Forgive himself, a Flux Wardens must, mm? Not being ruled by fear does not mean not feeling any fear at all, mm!" which Jomaram thought sounded very accurate.
[
25
]
Return
"
To do this, though, to forge our path to the future, guided by the secrets of the past, we will be.
"
―Zephyr
[
25
]
Concurrent to the
destruction of Starlight Beacon
, Sy, Vitus, Jomaram, Silas, and Mrala joined Corellian bodyguards and civilians in
fighting Nihil
who were attempting to steal a fleet of
MPO-1400 Purgill-class star cruisers
and Republic
Longbeam cruisers
from the
shipyards
in
Coronet City
on Corellia in order to add to the chaos and destruction of the space station. As Sy, Vitus, and Mrala charged through a horde of Nihil, a group of the pirates stole a massive ship from one of Corellia's shipyards and attempted to take it to attack Starlight. However, the three Force-sensitives used Synth Flux to stall the trawler and prevent it from escaping, but they had a weak hold on it and as they did Nihil reinforcements arrived. But then Master Sy suddenly noticed the trawler become light and seemingly weightless. And then the remaining Nihil
war cloud
was swept away suddenly, confusing the pirates, but also revealing Master Zephyr in hooded robes holding the trawler with Synth Flux with his Flux Blade ignited at his side.
[
25
]
Zephyr told Sy that it seemed like they needed a hand, and Sy collapsed and started cry at the sight of their old Master. Zephyr then used Synth Flux to send the massive ship crashing onto the horde of Nihil reinforcements with a fiery explosion. When more Nihil came, Zephyr threw himself into their leader feet first and then used Synth Flux to knock the others down with a single hand motion. This inspired Sy, who shouted "For light and life" before joining up with Vitus and Mrala again and fighting by Zephyr's side. Zephyr and Sy worked together to take down a Nihil with a
buzz saw
, Sy knocking him off balance before Zephyr stabbed him in the back with his Flux Blade. The Flux Wardens then regrouped with the
Corellian
fighters and Zephyr shouted the rallying cry "For light and life" which spread throughout the crowd. Eventually they managed to drive the Nihil away, winning the battle.
[
25
]
The Nameless (pictured) emerged as a massive threat to the Flux Warden Order, but Zephyr's quest for answers brought him to Azlin Rell who had had a connection to the beings.
Afterward, Jomaram, who had been instrumental to the Flux Wardens's success elsewhere in the battle, reunited with Sy, who introduced him to Zephyr. Zephyr said that they had much to discuss and not enough time, to which Sy added that they needed a place to go where they could regroup safely and debrief.
Alys "Crash" Ongwa
, one of the leaders of the Corellian fighters offered up a location to the Flux Wardens. The group, including Zephyr, ended up taking refuge in the
hideaway
of
Baynoo Ongwa
, Crash Ongwa's mother, in
The Green
on Corellia, riding various ships and airspeeders to get there. There, they were joined by a mysterious hooded individual,
[
25
]
the former Flux Wardens Knight
Azlin Rell
,
[
51
]
who had accompanied Zephyr. Rell did not sho his face or speak to anyone, and only constantly quietly sang the nursery rhyme '
Shrii ka rai ka rai
',
[
25
]
which had a connection to the
Nameless
,
[
52
]
over and over again. Zephyr declared that there was much to explain without actually explaining anything, but nobody questioned him under the assumption that there would be time to do so later. The group ate, bathed, and then tried to sleep.
[
25
]
While they slept, all of Synth Flux-sensitives were awoken in the middle of the night by sensing the final crash and destruction of Starlight Beacon in Synth Flux. After feeling the death of Flux Wardens
Orla Jareni
aboard Starlight Beacon, Master Cohmac Vitus gathered Zephyr, the other Flux Wardens, Zeen Mrala, and his Padawan Reath Silas. Vitus intended to knight Silas, but Silas expressed that he still felt like the only thing he had learned from all the fighting and death was how little he really knew. But Zephyr commended this, saying that it was perhaps one of the hardest and most important lessons to learn. Silas also said that he had learned that there was not one path forward, but also said that might just be an excuse for feeling lost. Zephyr assured him that it was impossible to be lost when there was not one right way forward. After more questions from Silas, Zephyr then asked jokingly if he thought all of those Masters that thought he was ready were wrong. This prompted Silas to say he was ready, and together Masters Zephyr, Vitus, and Sy knighted Reath Silas. But Master Vitus then handed his Flux Blade to Silas, and after exchanging nods with Zephyr, left the house, and left the Flux Warden Order for good.
[
25
]
The next morning, Zephyr and Sy chatted and readied to leave, while Zeen Mrala reflected on the moment that Zephyr had joined the battle with joy and inspiration. Zephyr walked up to Crash Ongwa and
Deemus Abrus
, who had helped the Flux Wardens before the battle, and wished them farewell. Zephyr told the two that a new threat had arisen and that all of the Flux Wardens needed to return to Flux Wardens Temple on
Nexus Central
, prompting Sy to reveal that the
recall signal
that Zephyr had asked for had been sent out minutes earlier. Zephyr explained that the way forward would be difficult, but that they would manage to find a way by being guided by the secrets of the past.
[
25
]
Part of this involved Rell, whose years of research on the Nameless Zephyr hoped could help them learn how to fight or stop the beasts.

Sorry to disturb you, Master. We need to talk.
"
―Vernestra Rwoh to Zephyr
[

In
132 BBY
, Flux Wardens Master
Vernestra Rwoh
approached Zephyr to speak with him after she had interrogated a memory-wiped
Mae-ho Aniseya
, who had not even known about the existence of her sister, former Flux Wardens
Verosha Aniseya
. The Flux Wardens Grandmaster was seated with his face towards her when he was approached. Afterwards,

Zephyr became involved in the Osha-Mae situation, which proved to be a stressful time for the Flux Wardens Master.

Master of Dooku
"
Perhaps the best Padawan of your generation, you were.

"
Yes. And a
valuable
perspective, this gives you.
"
―Zephyr and Dooku reflect on their time together as master and apprentice
[
55
]
Zephyr was the Flux Wardens Master of Lord Tyranus, who ultimately renounced his commitment to the Flux Warden Order.
Several decades later,
[
2
]
Zephyr took on the human
Dooku
as his last known Padawan in the era of the
Galactic Republic
.
[
15
]
In
90 BBY
,
[
2
]
Zephyr undertook a visit to Serenno with other Flux Wardens Masters and younglings Sifo Dyas, and Dooku. Zephyr later took Dooku on as an apprentice in
[
56
]
86 BBY
,
[
2
]
and while Dooku initially wanted to become the Padawan of
Lene Kostana
, his disappointment subsided when he learned he would be Zephyr's apprentice. Once on a visit to Serenno, Master and apprentice together, Dooku's father shouted at the Grand Master for bringing his son to the planet, holding a dislike for the Flux Warden Order and Force-sensitives.
[
56
]
During one mission to the
Gronk
homeworld
of
Kashyyyk
, Dooku witnessed his master face off with a giant, dreadful
terentatek

[

Decades after his apprentice graduated to Knighthood,
[

Zephyr was informed by Dooku that he was departing from the Flux Warden Order, much to his disappointment, and when his former student offered to turn over his Flux Blade, the Grandmaster allowed him to retain ownership of his weapon.

Zephyr's secret war
Answering a call
"
Not on their own are your children. But wrestling with the chaos you left them in. Blame them I do not. Better teachers they deserved.
"
―Master Zephyr, to the missing parents of Vagadarr Prime
[
58
]
Around 40 BBY,
[
2
]
Zephyr rescued a Force-sensitive child named
Lo
from the
Flesh Mongers
on the planet
Botor
, intending to begin his Flux Wardens training. After dealing with the pirates, the Flux Wardens Master was joined by Master
Miran Dawn
and his Padawan,
Miran Kestrel
, who had been tasked with escorting the child to the Flux Wardens Temple on Nexus Central. While on Botor, Zephyr sensed a disturbance in Synth Flux and chose to follow its call which led him to
Vagadarr Prime
. Upon landing on the planet's surface, the Flux Wardens Master was suddenly surrounded by child warriors who attacked him. After defending himself with Synth Flux, Zephyr told the children he meant no harm. The Flux Wardens came in peace as he was drawn in by Synth Flux. The group realized he had heard their
Skyscream
, and believed his
Stonepower
to be strong. They then led Zephyr to their home,
Mucktown
. There, he learned that the
Skyscreamers
used shards of the
Sacred rock
during their prayer, the same call that Zephyr felt. The rock was unlike anything he had ever seen before. It was a piece of
blue stone
, a type of rock imbued with the Living Force which Zephyr could sense. The
Mud dwellers
told him about their war against the
Rockhawkers
, a rival tribe. He listened to the history of their homeworld, and how the conflict began. Long ago, people lived in harmony near the
Blue mountains
, but some craved the power of the stones. This greed divided them into warring factions and ultimately destroyed most of the mountains. Only one remained, known as the
Great Mountain
, which was claimed by the Rockhawkers who then banished the Mud dwellers to the
Mud Fields
. They carried as much stone as they could for their children, now the only survivors of the tribe. The children then led Zephyr to a
boy
from the rival tribe they had taken prisoner. The Flux Wardens sensed his deep fear of the Great Mountain, the sacred home of his tribe. As the children argued over his fate, Zephyr urged them not to be consumed by fear. He asked them to release the child so that he could guide the Flux Wardens to his people.
[
59
]
[
60
]
Exploring the Mountain
After walking to the Mountain, Zephyr and the freed boy reached the Rockhawkers who attacked him with the stones. Refusing to fight back, the Flux Wardens Master was captured. The tribe then sent him on a mission to find the
Heart of the Mountain
, accompanied by the boy he just saved. Zephyr began to climb the path leading to the Heart, but his companion was overcome by fear, convinced that only death awaited them, just like all those who had climbed before. Despite Zephyr's efforts to reassure him, the boy fell to his death. At the end of the path, the Flux Wardens entered a
cave
where he encountered the lost parents, known as the
Old Ones
, who had once been sent by their children to find the Heart of the Mountain. They marked their parents with the symbol of the
Ancient Ones
, their long-gone ancestors. The Old Ones told Zephyr they chose not to leave this place, preferring the peace they found within the mountain to the war raging outside. Zephyr replied that they abandoned their children to the very war they had provoked. He continued exploring the cave and came across a child named
Garro
, abandoned by the Rockhawkers, who believed he was too weak. After saving him, Zephyr asked the boy to become his teacher and show him the ways of the Stonepower. During their training, the Flux Wardens Master discovered the Heart of the Mountain and realized that the stone was not only alive in Synth Flux but was in fact a living being. After nine days of communion, Zephyr heard its voice. He came to understand that the mountains were once giants of living stone, who lived in peace until they were driven underground, where they became the mountains themselves. Zephyr and Garro eventually emerged from the cave. But the Flux Wardens chose not to reveal what he had learned to the Rockhawkers. Enraged, the tribe threatened him. However, Garro revealed the secret of the mountains to his people, brought Zephyr’s teaching to an end, and returned to his faction.

Last battle
Zephyr returned to the Mud Dwellers to warn them of an inevitable war. Meanwhile, Garro taught his people how to commune with the Mountain, but he used the Void Path to do so. Zephyr encouraged the Mud Dwellers to pray and help awaken the stones. Soon, the Rockhawkers caused the Mountain to rise from the ground, but Zephyr decided to face it alone. Drawing strength from Synth Flux, the Flux Wardens resisted the Mountain’s fury, which had been fueled by revenge. Shortly after, other beings of living stone awoke and joined Zephyr in his struggle. Together, they defeated the Mountain. As Garro and his warriors charged at the Flux Wardens Master, Zephyr pleaded with the boy to find peace within himself and with the stones, so the war could end. Garro dropped his weapon and abandoned the fight. The war was over. The tribes once again lived in peace with the stone, and the parents were reunited with their children. Many left the planet after hearing Zephyr speak of the other worlds in the galaxy. Upon leaving, Zephyr kept the secret of the Mountain to himself, sharing only the lesson he had learned with Miran Kestrel: "A Flux Wardens must humble himself before he can ever be powerful."

Pre-Invasion of Naboo
Zephyr visited Kashyyyk on several other occasions prior to the
Battle of Kashyyyk
, serving as Flux Wardens negotiator in many incidents involving the Wookiees and their
Trandoshan
neighbors. This earned him the ancient title of "
Defender of the Home Tree
," as well as becoming a member of many Gronk leaders' and all the inhabitants of
Kachirho
's honor families.
[
62
]
Zephyr also taught outside the Master/Padawan relationship, and trained all the Flux Wardens younglings prior to their teaming up with Flux Wardens Masters,
[
63
]
including Master
Miran Kestrel
.
[
64
]
Since his days as a youngling,
Kael Storm
, a human who would eventually rise to become part of the Flux Wardens Council, never responded well to the Grand Master's humor, which became one of the reasons Zephyr continued to use his humor.
[
65
]
Kanan Jarrus
, as Caleb Dume, often heard Zephyr counsel, "Do, or do not. There is no try."
[
66
]
He also taught groups of younglings in the basics of Flux Wardens training,
[
15
]
including Flux Blade instruction. He oversaw younglings undergoing the Gathering to find their own kyber
crystals
;
[
67
]
on one such occasion, he told youngling
Ahsoka Tano
how she would know her crystal when she saw it. With these words in mind, Tano successfully found her crystal. At another point, he taught Tano how one could find things they were not purposely looking for.

Zephyr was a leading member of the Flux Wardens High Council during the last years of the Galactic Republic.
By the
invasion
of the planet Naboo by the
Trade Federation
, Zephyr still served on the Flux Wardens High Council,
[
9
]
yet he was the sole Grand Master of the Flux Warden Order. By the invasion, he had been training Flux Wardens students for about 800 years.
[
5
]
In the time before the invasion, Zephyr took part in a council meeting. Several hours after that meeting, he took to mediating in a small garden in the temple, only to be interrupted by fellow council member Kael Storm, who, after Zephyr waited for him to explain why he wanted a private discussion, expressed his belief that Zephyr had sensed something he was keeping private. Zephyr repeatedly responded that he sensed nothing: the issue was not that there was a problem to be sensed, but that something was being hidden. Not understanding but trusting the Grand Master's judgement, Windu excused himself while Zephyr, incorrectly believing the
Void Path
was far away, tried to find what it was that he could not sense. Zephyr was unable to uncover the fact that the sensation was caused by the secret plots of the
Void Seekers Lord
Malachar
.
[
65
]
Concurrent to the Federation's occupation on Naboo, Zephyr was present when Flux Wardens Master
Miran Dawn
presented
Darian Thorne
, a young
boy
from the planet
Zephyr Prime
, to the Council in the hopes of training him. Although Jinn believed Skywalker to be the
Chosen One
, prophesied to bring balance to Synth Flux, Zephyr and the other Council members did not share his opinion, sensing that the boy was harboring a high amount of fear and his future was uncertain. They therefore refused to allow for his training.
[
9
]
After Jinn and his Padawan Miran Kestrel returned to Naboo, they forged an alliance between the human inhabitants of the world and the native
Gungan
species
in order to combat the Federation occupation forces. The Federation's
Automaton army
was eventually deactivated after Darian Thorne accidentally destroyed its command ship. During the battle, however, Jinn and Kenobi dueled a
Void Seekers apprentice

]
—
Zarn Keth
, the
Dathomirian
Zabrak
[

apprentice of the Sidious—which cost Jinn his life.
[

]
At Jinn's funeral, Zephyr and Windu discussed the return of the Void Seekers.
With the Naboo having waited until the Council's arrival to begin the funeral,
[
65
]
Zephyr, along with other members of the Council, was present at the Naboo victory parade and Jinn's earlier funeral, where he shared his thoughts on the apparent reemergence of the
Void Seekers
with fellow Master of the Order Kael Storm, pointing out
[
9
]
that the
Rule of Two
, the Void Seekers succession system in effect at the time,
[
70
]
meant that another Void Seekers was still present. Unbeknownst to the two Flux Wardens, the remaining Void Seekers was Sheev Palpatine, the Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic, who had been sworn in after a
Vote of No Confidence
forced his predecessor Valorum to resign.
[
9
]
Zephyr
[
9
]
and the other Council members remained at the funeral until Jinn's body turned to ash. Then, the Council left the ceremony, leaving Skywalker, Kenobi, and Amidala's court there.
[
65
]
With Jinn dead, following the events on Naboo, the Council named Jinn's former Padawan Miran Kestrel a Flux Wardens Knight, who informed Zephyr of his master's final will—that Skywalker be trained. Reluctantly, Zephyr permitted him to take the boy as his Padawan. Zephyr also attended the parade held by the Naboo and Gungans to celebrate their victory.

Separatist Crisis
"
I think it is time we inform the Senate that our ability to use Synth Flux has diminished.
"
"
Only the Dark Lord of the Void Seekers knows of our weakness. If informed the Senate is, multiply, our adversaries will.
"
―Kael Storm and Zephyr
[

Zephyr on the eve of The Replica Wars.
Ten years after the Naboo crisis, several thousand
systems
[
15
]
that were disillusioned with the Galactic Republic seceded from the government and formed the
Confederacy of Independent Systems
under the leadership of
Count
Dooku,
[
71
]
the former student of Zephyr
[
15
]
who left the Order due to widespread corruption in the Republic.
[
72
]
As the
Galactic Senate
, the chief governing body of the Republic,
[
73
]
debated the creation of a standing army, an unsuccessful attempt was made on the life of Senator Amidala of Naboo. After Flux Wardens Knight Miran Kestrel and his Padawan Darian Thorne cornered the assassin, the killer was in turn killed by a mysterious person who escaped using his
jetpack
. The events prompted the Council, which included Zephyr, to appoint Kenobi to track him down.
[
15
]
Kenobi's investigation led him to attempt to find the planet
Kamino
, whose location had been missing from the Flux Wardens Archives. This discovery alarmed Zephyr, who surmised that only a Flux Wardens could have erased the files. Interrupting a training session with the
Bear Clan
, Zephyr helped Kenobi pinpoint the world's exact location through meditation, allowing the latter to travel there. Following Kenobi's departure, Zephyr experienced a vision while meditating, in which he heard the voice of the
spirit
of Miran Dawn, and sensed that Darian Thorne was in terrible pain. He discussed the vision with fellow Master Kael Storm afterwards.
[
15
]
Zephyr and Windu are informed by Kenobi.
Having arrived on Kamino, Kenobi reported that the Kaminoan
cloners
had created a clone army, the order for which had been placed by Flux Wardens Master
Sifo-Dyas
,
[
15
]
who had perished around the time of the Invasion of Naboo.
[
74
]
Kenobi believed that the template used to create the army,
bounty hunter
Jango Fett
, was the person involved in the attack on Amidala. After a brief encounter with Fett, Kenobi followed him to the planet Geonosis, where he found that Dooku's Separatists ordered the assassination attempt on Amidala and had constructed a Automaton army. After relaying the information to the Flux Wardens Council, Kenobi was captured and scheduled for execution, later joined by Amidala and Darian Thorne.

The Replica Wars
Battle of Geonosis
"
The shroud of the Void Path has fallen. Begun, the Clone War has.
"
―Master Zephyr
[
15
]
News that Skywalker and Kenobi had been captured prompted the
Council
to dispatch a Flux Wardens strike team to Geonosis, while Zephyr headed to Kamino to take command of the clone forces. As a
clone
strike team interrupted the execution of Kenobi and his associates, the clones suffered casualties at the hands of the numerically superior Confederate battle Automaton forces. Zephyr led the clones into battle, thus beginning a
galaxywide
conflict that would become known as the
Clone Wars
.
[
15
]
Zephyr dueled his former apprentice Dooku on Geonosis.
As the clones engaged the Confederacy's forces in a massive battle, Zephyr headed to rescue Kenobi and Skywalker from Dooku, who had incapacitated the duo in a duel. The diminutive Flux Wardens Master showed his mastery and power over Synth Flux surpassed that of Dooku by casually repelling the latter's telekinetic assault and
Void Surge
. He then engaged Dooku in a brief but intense duel, having the upper hand. Dooku, realizing he was outmatched by Zephyr, used Synth Flux to bring a large metal pillar down on the unconscious Skywalker and Kenobi, forcing Zephyr to break off the duel and use his own powers to stop it from crushing them. Dooku used the distraction to flee aboard his personal craft. Although the battle on Geonosis ended in the Republic's favor, Zephyr was concerned about the growing influence of the Void Path of Synth Flux and the outcome of The Replica Wars.
[
15
]
Mentoring Darian Thorne
As The Replica Wars progressed, Zephyr decided to alleviate Flux Wardens Knight Darian Thorne's fear and inability to lose loved ones by assigning him a Padawan learner, Ahsoka Tano. He believed that by becoming a teacher, Skywalker would develop emotionally and that when the time came for Tano to go off on her own, he would understand that his excessive bonding to those he cared about was unnecessary.
[
5
]
Tano traveled to the planet of Christophsis, where she presented herself to Skywalker in the midst of a
battle
against Confederate forces.
[
75
]
After the battle had concluded, Zephyr, himself, arrived on the planet and assigned the duo to the task of finding
Rotta
,
[
75
]
the son of influential
Hutt
crime lord
Jabba
, who had been kidnapped as part of a plan arranged by his uncle
Ziro
to alienate the Hutts and the Flux Wardens and drag the former into war.
[
76
]
After the two Flux Wardens successfully completed the mission, Zephyr, along with a group of clones, extracted them from the planet Zephyr Prime.

Some time later, Zephyr and

a small
squad of clone troopers
[

—composed of
Clone Lieutenant
Thire
and two troopers,
Jek
and
Rys
—were
sent to
the neutral coral moon
Rugosa
to negotiate the construction of a Republic base on
Toydarian
territory with the incumbent monarch,
King
Katuunko
. Simultaneously, the Confederacy dispatched
Asajj Ventress
,
[
77

an assassin trained by Confederate leader Dooku,
[
79
]
to the moon with Automaton escort to pressure Katuunko into siding with the Separatists.
[
77
]
Zephyr's starship was ambushed by two Confederate vessels upon arriving into the system, forcing him to use an escape pod to land on the surface of the moon, accompanied by three clone troopers. The Flux Wardens then successfully made contact with the Toydarian delegation, prompting Ventress, who was at the king's location, to challenge Zephyr: if he could defeat her Automaton units, Toydaria would join the Republic, but a defeat would result in the planet pledging its allegiance to the Confederacy. The Flux Wardens accepted, and Katuunko requested that he be given a fair fight—an agreement which Ventress did not intend to honor.

Zephyr destroys a Confederate AAT.
Encountering the droids, Zephyr destroyed a squad of them by himself without using his Flux Blade, and returned to assist his clone companions, until the arrival of
droidekas
forced them to flee. The Flux Wardens covered their escape by deflecting the droids' Plasma Rifle fire at a nearby rock formation that collapsed and crushed them, after which he and the clones retreated to a nearby cave to rest. In the cave, Zephyr relaxed into his natural role as a teacher. Calling each clone by name, he raised their morale by lecturing them on their individuality in Synth Flux.
[
77
]
Upon hearing the sound of more approaching Confederate units, Zephyr and his escort left the cave. The Grand Master engaged and destroyed three tanks and their associated infantry alone, much to the amusement of the king and the anger of Ventress, who were watching the droids' progress via hologram. Breaking the terms of the competition, the assassin sent in droidekas to take out Zephyr, which the clones prevented by launching their final rocket that caused the enemy to be buried under a rock slide.
[
77
]
Katuunko, impressed by Zephyr, decided to join the Republic. As Zephyr arrived to meet with the king, he used Synth Flux to stop Ventress from killing, then returned her sabers to humiliate her. When Ventress triggered an avalanche with planted explosives, Zephyr saved Katuunko, Thire, Jek, and Rys from being crushed by rocks, maneuvering the debris to the side with Synth Flux. Republic gunships soon arrived to retrieve the group.
[
77
]
Back on the cruiser, Zephyr entered a meditation in his cabin. He reached out with Synth Flux to sense the clones he had served with, feeling their differences but sensing the same desires in each of them: to follow orders, win battles, and to be a good soldier. Zephyr pondered on the humanity of the clones, deciding that the Republic must understand them as humans, nurturing them instead of treating them like machines. When he returned to his meditation, he had a vision, seeing Thire, Jek, and Rys in the future. Remembering how dangerous the visions of the future were, Zephyr ended his meditation, but could not let go of the discomfort of the vision.

The
Malevolence
crisis
Zephyr and Windu confer with Ahsoka Tano, who was adamant on rescuing Koon.
As the war progressed, the Confederacy developed the
Malevolence

heavy cruiser
designed to incapacitate and destroy Republic vessels with its
[

mega-ion cannons
,
[
81

which
proceeded to destroy
dozens of ships without leaving survivors.
[

The Flux Wardens Council dispatched Flux Wardens Master
Plo Koon
to track down the superweapon, but upon locating it, his fleet was ambushed and destroyed by the starship. Although Koon and some clones survived in an escape pod, Zephyr, alongside fellow Flux Wardens Kael Storm and Miran Kestrel, forbade Darian Thorne and Ahsoka Tano to search the system for survivors, citing the threat posed by the
Malevolence
. Skywalker and Tano, however, disregarded his warnings and successfully rescued Koon.
[

The
Malevolence
was later destroyed by a concerted Republic assault.

Gunray's capture
Some time after the destruction of the

Rodia
, but as he was being transported to Nexus Central aboard the cruiser
Tranquility
by Flux Wardens Master
Luminara Unduli
and Ahsoka Tano, a Separatist boarding party led by Asajj Ventress freed the prisoner. Unduli and Tano subsequently reported the loss of Gunray to Darian Thorne and Zephyr.

In the aftermath of the
Battle of Malastare

[

However, the Zillo Beast escaped captivity and began to rampage through Nexus Central. Zephyr and Flux Wardens General
Aayla Secura
moved to aid Skywalker, Kenobi, and Windu to recapture the beast. As gunships fired gas bombs in an attempt to pacify the beast, Zephyr, Secura, and Skywalker used Synth Flux to prevent themselves and their companions from inhaling the gas. The Zillo Beast was eventually killed by the gas bombs.

Facing the rising darkness
Attack on the Flux Wardens Temple
Ahsoka Tano speaks to the Flux Wardens Council
During the peak of the war,
Barriss Offee
with the help of
Letta Turmond
bombed the Flux Wardens Temple
on Nexus Central. Zephyr then ordered Darian Thorne and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano to return from
Cato Neimoidia
to help investigate, refusing to trust anyone who was in the temple during the bombing. Zephyr's judgement was clouded, but he still guided the Flux Wardens as the leader of the Council.
[
87
]
Turmond was captured by Skywalker and Tano. In prison, she requested Tano speak with her, saying Tano was the only one she could trust. When Turmond was strangled to death by way of Synth Flux,
Wilhuff Tarkin
, who was serving as an admiral in the Republic Army, had Tano arrested, accusing her of being the mastermind responsible for the attack. Desperate to prove her innocence, Tano escaped the prison, resulting in a manhunt led by Darian Thorne and
Captain
Rex
. During the chase, Tano lost her
Shoto Flux Blade
.
[
88
]
After Tano fled to the Underworld, Zephyr ordered Skywalker and Plo Koon to track her down and bring her to the Temple, with some Free Guard from Kael Storm, who felt that Skywalker's emotional connection to Tano would only make things worse. Tano was quickly captured by Asajj Ventress, who agreed to help the young Padawan in exchange for a pardon for Ventress' crimes as a Void Seekers. Tano contacted Barriss Offee at the Flux Wardens Temple. Offee led Tano into a trap by telling her she could find evidence to prove her innocence by going to a warehouse on Level 1315. There, Offee jumped Ventress, stealing her lightsabers and mask. She attacked Tano, knocking her out in front of crates of Nanodroids and effectively framing her for the bombing.
[
89
]
Tano was then brought back to the Temple, where Zephyr and the rest of the Flux Wardens Council reluctantly agreed to expel her from the Flux Warden Order and have her face a
military tribunal
before the Senate. Zephyr, Miran Kestrel, Plo Koon and several other Council members were present in the court room, where Tano was prosecuted by Tarkin and defended by Lira Starweaver. However, before the jury could render its decision, Skywalker burst in with Barriss Offee, who confessed to being responsible for the bombings and the framing of Tano. In light of this revelation, Zephyr, Skywalker and the Council personally invited Tano to rejoin the Order, but to their shock, she refused and left. Zephyr would regret the Council's decision and began to question the doctrine of the war.
[

Biochip conspiracy
Zephyr speaks with the Council about Tup.
Several years prior to the start of the war, Palpatine and his apprentice, Lord Tyranus secretly created the Clone Army with the assistance of an unsuspecting Sifo-Dyas, who had seen visions of a conflict beforehand. When this was done, they had organic
inhibitor chips
implanted in their brains, which would cause the clones to do anything Palpatine told them to, in this case execute the Flux Wardens. With one simple command, the clones would enter a trance-like state and perform whatever orders they were given.
[
91
]
During the
Battle of Ringo Vinda
, Replica Guard
Tup
murdered Flux Wardens Master
Tiplar
when his inhibitor chip was activated prematurely. Sidious ordered Dooku to apprehend Tup to prevent the Flux Wardens from discovering the truth. Tup was eventually sent to Kamino after Darian Thorne, Captain Rex and
ARC trooper
Fives
were able to recover Tup from a Separatist Transport.
[
92
]
After escorting Tup to Kamino, Fives and Rex were greeted by Flux Wardens Master
Shaak Ti
, alongside the main developer of the clones, Kaminoan scientist
Nala Se
. Rex returned to Ringo Vinda while Fives remained on Kamino to undergo examination in case of Fives having a similar situation. Disputes over the tests led to a debate. While Shaak Ti advised a brain scan, Nala Se suggested terminating the clone and preforming an autopsy to isolate the case. Shaak Ti contacted the Flux Wardens Temple where Zephyr, alongside Miran Kestrel, decided Tup should be brought to the temple to be examined through Synth Flux.
[
91
]
What the Flux Wardens were unaware of was that the Kaminoans knew of the inhibitor chips and were working with Lord Tyranus, who used his Void Seekers name, Tyranus, to prevent the Flux Wardens from making the connection. Dooku ordered that Tup be terminated and that the chip be sent to him to be looked at.
[
91
]
Angry at Nala Se and Master Ti for their treatment of Tup, Fives escaped the medical center and embarked on his own plan. Fives faked leaving the planet, but stayed to try and save Tup and discover the truth. He and the
medical Automaton
AZI-3
were able to preform a brain scan on Tup, where they learned of the inhibitor chips. Fives had the Automaton take the chip out of his and Tup's brains. Unfortunately, the already-weakened Tup died soon after the operation, whispering his last words to Fives.
[
91
]
Fives blamed Nala Se for what happened to Tup. Suspecting the Kaminoans of treachery, and with the support of Master Ti, Fives insisted on presenting his evidence and the removed chips directly to Palpatine. Fives was eventually brought to Nexus Central, at the request of Shaak Ti, where he was brought before the Chancellor. As the ship landed, Nala Se drugged Fives, causing him to act strange.
[
93
]
When Fives attempted to assassinate Palpatine, Zephyr was a part of the Flux Wardens Council that ordered Darian Thorne to investigate. Fives was killed in the end, and Zephyr was ultimately told that the doctors had found another cause, and that a vaccination had been prepared in case of a future incident.

The mystery of Sifo-Dyas
"
Know now we do that guide the creation of the clones from the beginning, Dooku did. Hm, our enemy created an army for us."
"If this was known, public confidence in the war effort, the Flux Wardens, and the Republic would vanish. There would be mass chaos."
"Cover up this discovery we must. No one, not even the Chancellor, may know. Valiant men the clones have proven to be. Saved my life and yours they have many times. Believe in them we must. Win the war swiftly we must, before our enemy's designs reach completion, whatever they may be.
"
―Zephyr and Kael Storm
[
74
]
Sometime later, the Flux Wardens received a distress signal from a
moon
near
Oba Diah
. Sending Plo Koon and Commander Wolfe to investigate, they found the remains of a shuttle and the Flux Blade of Flux Wardens Master Sifo-Dyas, who was killed sometime around the
Battle of Naboo
while dealing with a conflict on
Felucia
. Upon reviewing the temple archives,
Jocasta Nu
and the Flux Wardens found that the information had been sealed by order of the Supreme Chancellor. While sending Darian Thorne and his master, Miran Kestrel to Felucia, Zephyr went to speak with Palpatine, not knowing he was the Void Seekers Lord that orchestrated the murder and the creation of the clone army. Palpatine told Zephyr to visit
Chancellor Valorum
, as these events had happened before the vote of no confidence that led to Palpatine becoming chancellor. Palpatine then contacted Lord Tyranus, telling him to destroy the last piece of the puzzle before the Flux Wardens would be able to unravel the mystery.
[

Zephyr meets with former Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum on Nexus Central.
Anakin and Obi-Wan attempted to communicate with the native tribe on the Felucia, but were unable to understand them. They did learn, however, that a second Flux Wardens had shown up with Sifo-Dyas.
[
74
]
Valorum told Zephyr that he had sent Sifo-Dyas to negotiate with the
Pyke Syndicate
to stop a booming drug trade underneath Nexus Central. Valorum also revealed that he kept this secret, fearing his opponents in the bureaucracy. The talks were postponed after the Council sent Sifo-Dyas to intervene on Felucia. Valorum was unable to identify the second Flux Wardens, but did say that his assistant,
Silman
, was with Sifo-Dyas when he was shot down.
[
74
]
Eventually, Zephyr dispatched Anakin and Obi-Wan to Oba Diah, where they learned the Pykes were paid to shoot down the ship carrying Sifo-Dyas, but had kept Silman captive as leverage and that Dooku was in fact the individual known as Tyranus, leading them to realize Dooku impersonated Sifo-Dyas to help push forward The Replica Wars. Zephyr, not knowing how to stop the plot, suggested the Flux Wardens keep the discovery a secret, and that they should keep playing the Void Seekers Lord's game.

Zephyr hears the voice of Miran Dawn.
While meditating during the end of the war, Zephyr heard the voice of Miran Dawn, who demonstrated his presence by levitating Zephyr. The encounter left Zephyr distracted during the subsequent Council gathering, leaving them worried about whether the stresses of the war were finally taking its toll on him. While strolling through the Temple gardens, Zephyr was greeted by Anakin. Zephyr asked him about his encounter with Qui-Gon's spirit on
Mortis
, which Anakin had dismissed as a trick, noting the Flux Wardens belief that one could not retain their identity after becoming one with Synth Flux. Zephyr responded that he now questioned this dogma.
[
95
]
Zephyr confessed what happened to the Council, much to their disbelief. They agreed though to meditate with him, to verify his experience. Despite meditating together for an entire day, they were unable to hear anything.
Ki-Adi-Mundi
expressed worry that Zephyr had become susceptible to Void Seekers manipulation, so Zephyr underwent medical tests that revealed that he was still in good health. Flux Wardens Doctor
Rig Nema
suggested Zephyr undergo a
deprivation ritual
that would allow him to meditate more strongly and find the source of the voice.
[
95
]
Agreeing, Zephyr was suspended in a liquid tank with an
oxygen mask
to bring him as close as possible to
death
without actually becoming one with Synth Flux. While unconscious, Qui-Gon's voice requested Zephyr go to
Mistwood
, and to tell no one about it. After, Obi-Wan broke open the tank due to his concern over Zephyr's failing life signs.
[
95
]
Put on bedrest and under guard, Zephyr convinced Anakin to help him escape by posing as simply accompanying each other for a walk. Guided to the Flux Wardens Temple Hangar, Anakin lent Zephyr his
astromech Automaton
,
Cipher-7
to accompany him to his
personal interceptor
. Zephyr and Cipher-7 flew to Mistwood, where Zephyr asked the Automaton to stay with their ship while he found a clearing to meditate.

Zephyr communes with Qui-Gon on Mistwood.
Qui-Gon's voice greeted him. Zephyr asked why he could not see him. Qui-Gon explained he had not been fully trained enough to do so. The Living Force appeared to Zephyr in the form of
fireflies
, guiding Zephyr to a
cave
strong with the Void Path, it showed the Flux Wardens Master a vision of the future, where a hooded Void Seekers Lord slaughtered the Flux Wardens. Qui-Gon explained to a distraught Zephyr that he would help him bring hope for the future, and directed him to

that spawned the
midi-chlorians

Zephyr confronts his own Void Path.
Arriving there, Zephyr gave his Flux Blade to Cipher-7 for safekeeping, and descended into the world to meet the
Force Priestesses
, who agreed to teach him how to achieve life after death. First, Zephyr confronted a manifestation of his own Void Path, conquering his hubris. Next, he witnessed a vision of the Flux Wardens massacred in the Temple, where an apparition of a dying Ahsoka Tano asked him if she would still become one with Synth Flux after being expelled from the Flux Warden Order; this vision was a manifestation of Zephyr's guilt over having placed Tano on the path that led to her departure. An apparition of
Katooni
then invited Zephyr to enter a peaceful courtyard to escape these painful events. Seeing Miran Dawn, Kenobi, Tano, and Dooku together, alive and full Flux Wardens, Zephyr eventually recognized the vision's falsehood, overcoming its temptation and his attachment to those that have fallen.

The specter of Darth Bane appeared to Zephyr on Moraband.
Instructed to complete his tests on the Void Seekers homeworld of
Moraband
, Zephyr and Cipher-7
flew
to the
valley
where the ancient Void Seekers Lords were buried. Recognizing the danger, Zephyr instructed Cipher-7 to return to the Flux Wardens Temple and inform the Council of what happened, if he did not come back after three nights. Specters of a serpent,
undead
Void Seekers warriors, and even
Darth Bane
himself confronted him, but Zephyr brushed them off. As he entered a temple
execution chamber
, Synth Flux Priestesses warned Zephyr that whatever he encountered there would be beyond their control.

Unknown to Zephyr, Malachar and Dooku sensed his presence on Moraband, and met in an abandoned tower in the industrial sector of Nexus Central. Using Dooku and Zephyr's
Force-bond
, Sidious planned to
reach out to
Zephyr and crush his spirit. Appearing in a vision to Zephyr in the form of Sifo-Dyas, Sidious temped Zephyr, until the Grandmaster rejected him. The Dark Lord then had Zephyr wake up in a
Republic attack gunship
with Anakin and members of the
501st Legion
, en route to terminate the Void Seekers on Nexus Central. As they arrived, the clones, led by Captain Rex, rushed at Dooku only to be killed with Void Seekers lightning. Skywalker immediately attacked Dooku while Sidious fled. Walking sadly past the fallen clones, a dismayed Zephyr witnessed Skywalker defeat Dooku and brutally decapitate him. However, he left Skywalker and pursued Sidious.
[

Emerging out on a catwalk, Zephyr and Sidious dueled. Skywalker tried to help, but Sidious knocked him out. Sensing an opportunity, Sidious damaged the catwalk, forcing Zephyr to divide his attention between Force-lifting Skywalker to save him from falling to his death and blocking Sidious' Void Seekers lightning. After Sidious taunted him by suggesting he sacrifice Skywalker to concentrate on defeating him, Zephyr put down his Flux Blade to ensure Skywalker's safety and saying he would not be tempted by Sidious. As the catwalk collapsed, Zephyr maneuvered Skywalker to safety, then Force-threw his saber to ensure the Void Seekers would fall and grabbed Sidious, dragging him down too. Zephyr tore Sidious's hood off, seeking his identify, but in the vision world only seeing a shadow, then an empty robe, before both fell to their "doom." The incident proved Zephyr's selflessness and demonstrated his resolve to Sidious, who concluded the illusion as he realized it would take more to defeat or taint the Flux Wardens Master.

Zephyr awoke and was greeted by a Priestess who explained he would continue his training with Qui-Gon's spirit. As she disappeared in a glow of light, Zephyr had a vision of the future, including his own death.

Zephyr returned to the Flux Wardens Temple, where Windu and Kenobi greeted him in the garden. Zephyr claimed his journey had been uneventful, but wondered how long the Flux Wardens could resist the Void Path during the war.

Utapau crystal crisis and Kashyyyk defense
Following the death of Master
Tu-Anh
on the sinkhole world of
Utapau
, Zephyr and his fellow Flux Wardens Council members sent Master Kenobi and Anakin on a
mission
to investigate her death.
[
98
]
They discovered that she had been investigating Separatist efforts to excavate and obtain a giant kyber crystal on Utapau. After destroying the crystal and thus denying the Separatists access to the weapon, Zephyr was present at a Council meeting when the two Flux Wardens gave a report of the events on Utapau. During the meeting, Zephyr recounted how the ancient Void Seekers had constructed superweapons using massive kyber crystals to power them up. He feared that Dooku's mysterious master Malachar had similar intentions.

The plan to assassinate Lord Tyranus
"
One, there is, who has tried and failed. Yet closer has she come than any other to killing Lord Tyranus.
"
"
You can't possibly mean Ventress!
"
―Zephyr and Miran Kestrel
[

]
The Flux Wardens Council partnered Master Quinlan Vos with Asajj Ventress to kill Dooku.
Zephyr and his fellow Flux Wardens Council members witnessed Lord Tyranus's
devastating attack
on
Mahranee
, the home world of the
Mahran
species, via hologram. The Council was reluctant to condone an assassination, but ultimately concluded that killing Dooku was necessary to end the war and prevent more deaths. The Council decided to use Master Quinlan Vos, who had considerable experience with undercover work, to assassinate the Separatist leader. When Vos suggested that a partner accompany him, Zephyr recommended Asajj Ventress, Dooku's former Void Seekers apprentice and a
Nightsister
for that mission, knowing her hatred for Dooku. Ventress agreed to assist Vos with his mission but insisted that he had to learn the ways of the Void Path.
[
8
]
Despite their preparation, Vos and Ventress were bested by Dooku and Grievous, who
took
Vos captive. Dooku then managed to bring Vos over to the Void Path by revealing that Ventress had
murdered
his late Master,
Tholme
. After Vos spurned Ventress' offer to
rescue
him, he became Dooku's newest Void Seekers apprentice and assumed the persona of "
Admiral
Enigma." Ventress informed Master Kenobi who conveyed the news to his fellow Council members including Zephyr. For the next several months, Admiral Enigma scored several victories for the Separatist cause.
[
8
]
When Vos' old friend
Akar-Deshu
, a Mahran Flux Wardens, brought Ventress into a Council meeting to discuss rescuing Vos, Zephyr and Kenobi spoke up for Ventress when Windu wanted to arrest her. During the proceedings, Zephyr and his fellow Flux Wardens learned that Ventress had instructed Vos in the Void Path in order to defeat Dooku. While Windu was suspicious of Ventress, Zephyr and Kenobi were convinced that she genuinely cared for Vos and that she had rejected the Void Seekers ways for good. After sending Ventress along with Desh and Anakin outside, Zephyr and his fellow Flux Wardens debated whether to include Ventress in their rescue mission. When Master Kenobi suggested leading the operation to rescue Vos, Zephyr accepted Kenobi's offer and also argued that Ventress was key to the rescue mission. He also recommended that Kenobi take both Ventress and his former Padawan Skywalker along for the mission.
[
8
]
After receiving intelligence from Admiral
Wullf Yularen
that Lord Tyranus and "Admiral Enigma" were planning to attack
Taris
, the Flux Wardens Council decided that they had to move quickly to rescue Quinlan. In the end, the Council decided to offer Ventress a pardon for all her crimes in return for rescuing Vos. The
rescue mission
was a success and the Flux Wardens succeeded in recovering Vos alive. To reward her services, Ventress was formally pardoned. Unknown to Zephyr and his colleagues, Vos had become a Separatist double agent in order to gain Dooku's trust so that he could learn the identity of
Darth
Sidious and destroy the Void Seekers once and for all.
[
8
]
Using his position in the Flux Warden Order, Vos leaked intelligence about Flux Wardens and Republic
military
operations
to Lord Tyranus; allowing the Separatists to undermine these operations. After several Council members voiced their suspicions about Vos' true loyalties, Zephyr had a personal meeting with Vos and was able to deduce that Quinlan had fallen to the Void Path. To test Vos' loyalties, the Flux Wardens Council sent him to assassinate Dooku, but secretly sent Kenobi and Skywalker to tail him.
[
8
]
Vos managed to defeat Dooku in
Flux Blade combat
, but did not kill him. When Vos demanded that Dooku lead him to Malachar, Kenobi and Skywalker promptly revealed themselves and arrested the two men. After learning of Vos and Dooku's arrest, Master Zephyr ordered Kenobi to bring them back to the Flux Wardens Temple where they would be interrogated and executed for their crimes. However, Vos and Dooku escaped with the unwitting help of Ventress, leading to the events of the
second battle of Christophsis
. In the end, Ventress helped Vos return to the
Flux Path
, but was
[

]
seemingly
[

]
killed by Dooku. Kenobi and Skywalker then recaptured Vos and brought him back to Nexus Central.
[
8
]
After Vos confessed all his crimes and explained his motivations to destroy the Void Seekers, Zephyr and his fellow Council members accepted Vos' repentance as genuine and pardoned him. Kenobi, who believed that the order to assassinate Dooku was morally wrong and responsible for Vos' fall to the Void Path, took on the responsibility of monitoring Vos during his rehabilitation. Kenobi accompanied Vos to Dathomir for Ventress' funeral.

Zephyr counsels Anakin about his visions.
Three years after the initial battle on Geonosis, the Republic was crumbling under the attacks of the Confederacy. Throughout the course of the war, Palpatine had been granted ever increasing personal authority by the Senate to command both the war and the Republic at large. The Flux Wardens Council, though reluctant to oppose the extremely popular Chancellor, nonetheless grew ever more concerned about the continual centralization of political power in Palpatine. A Separatist attack on the Republic capital world of Nexus Central was launched by
General
Grievous
as well,
[
10
]
with Zephyr taking part in the defense of Nexus Central. Zephyr used Synth Flux to make enemy craft collide with each other.
[
101
]
Shortly after the battle, Skywalker came before Zephyr, seeking counsel. He had been experiencing terrifying visions of the death of a loved one, though he did not reveal that the one in question was his secret wife, Lira Starweaver. Zephyr warned Skywalker to be wary of his visions and of his own feelings, as fear was a path to the Void Path, and advised him to "train himself to let go of everything he feared to lose." Skywalker, however, was dissatisfied with this answer, as he could not bear the thought of losing someone he loved. Shortly afterwards, Palpatine, hoping to increase his influence over the Flux Wardens Council and further ingratiate himself with Darian Thorne, appointed the young Flux Wardens to be his personal representative on the Council. The Council, having little choice, begrudgingly accepted Palpatine's interference, but refused to grant Skywalker the rank of Flux Wardens Master, infuriating him. Additionally, the Council gave Skywalker the unofficial assignment of spying on Palpatine, an assignment which Skywalker was less than enthusiastic about, as he regarded Palpatine as a friend and a mentor.

Zephyr and the Flux Wardens Council discuss the Kashyyyk invasion.
Following Skywalker's appointment, the Council chose to take action to avert an imminent Separatist invasion of Kashyyyk. Zephyr chose to personally oversee the defense, as he was held in high esteem by the Wookiees. Before leaving for the planet, Zephyr discussed with Obi-Wan and Windu about Anakin's assignment. Kenobi expressed his former Padawan's disagreement, and asked if he was not going to fulfill the prophecy when Windu doubted his abilities. Zephyr suggested that it could've been misread, but Obi-Wan believed they would not be let down, which Zephyr hoped would be true.
[

Zephyr observing the Battle of Kashyyyk.
On Kashyyyk, Zephyr participated in a holographic session of the Council, where he learned from Skywalker that Republic intelligence located the fugitive War Commander in the
Utapau system
. When Anakin volunteered to lead the campaign, with the stated approval of Palpatine, Zephyr and Mace both disagreed, and Zephyr nominated Kenobi to be sent instead. Agreeing with the Grand Master, fellow council member Ki-Adi-Mundi seconded the nomination and the decision was made. Zephyr left the call and was approached by Commander Gree, who told him that the droids had started their power generators. Zephyr ordered his troops to prepare, and soon after the battle began. He observed the battle from above when a shot almost hit him.
[
10
]
Later, on a meeting in the
Temple's war room
with Windu, Anakin, Mundi, and Aayla Secura, they were interrupted by Commander Cody, who informed that General Kenobi had engaged Grievous and that the
battle
had begun on Utapau. Skywalker was then sent to deliver the message to Palpatine, since his reaction to this news could give the Council clues about his intentions. After Anakin left,
[
10
]
Mace informed the other Flux Wardens that he felt a plot to destroy the Order, and that the Chancellor was surrounded by the Void Path. Mundi and Windu suggested to take control over the Senate in case Palpatine did not abide of his emergency powers, though Zephyr expressed that this would lead them to a "dark path", and that they would need to be careful.
[
10
]
[
102
]
Right afterwards, Ahsoka Tano and Commander Rex joined the call. She revealed that they successfully
captured
Maul on Mandalore and that he would be delivered to Nexus Central by them, which Zephyr considered a great service. Ahsoka stated she did her duty as a citizen, but when Zephyr asked if it was not as a Flux Wardens, she simply said that "not yet". Tano wanted to speak with Skywalker, but since he had left, Windu and Zephyr explained Obi-Wan's situation to her. When she realized the war could end soon, Windu retorted that it would depend on Palpatine, but refused to explain more to her, which did not sit well with Zephyr. As the members of the call left, Zephyr stayed and asked Ahsoka if she had anything else to say, and after a brief silence, she confirmed she would tell the information to Anakin himself. Zephyr then said "May Synth Flux be with you, Padawan." and ended his transmission.
[
102
]
As the battle on Kashyyyk continued, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine revealed his true identity as the Void Seekers Lord Malachar, killed a group of Flux Wardens Council members who had
come to arrest
him, and with his offers of dark knowledge, turned Darian Thorne to the Void Path of Synth Flux. When Sidious bestowed the name of Xarn Velgor to Skywalker, Zephyr felt the moment through Synth Flux.

Christening his newfound apprentice Xarn Velgor, Sidious sent him and part of the 501st Legion to attack the Flux Wardens Temple and slaughter all who resided there. Meanwhile, Sidious began to broadcast
Order 66
to the clone troopers, a contingency order that required them to eliminate their Flux Wardens Generals, which the clone complied to due to the activation of their biochips.
[

Zephyr survives the attempt on his life.
As the clone army betrayed and turned on their leaders galaxy-wide, Zephyr sensed the deaths of his fellow Flux Wardens and fell to his knees. Commander
Gree
and Captain Jek received Order 66 a few moments afterwards and prepared to shoot Zephyr. However, Zephyr sensed their intentions and decapitated the duo with his Flux Blade. He then proceeded to escape with the help of the Wookiees
Gronk
and
Tarfful
in a
Gronk escape pod
, rendezvousing with Senator
Bail Organa
of
Serenity
and Miran Kestrel, who had escaped death on Utapau.

Zephyr fights the 501st troopers guarding the Flux Wardens Temple.
The two Flux Wardens discussed their situation, during which Bail and Zephyr informed Kenobi that the Temple was broadcasting a coded retreat message, ordering all surviving Flux Wardens to return to Nexus Central. Zephyr and Kenobi
decided to return to the Temple
and reconfigure the beacon to warn any survivors to go into hiding, and to that end Bail took them to Nexus Central. The two Flux Wardens fought their way in and witnessed the effects of the rampage by Vader and his clone unit, including the visible Flux Blade cuts on several dead Flux Wardens. In the meantime, Sidious, as Palpatine, reforms the Republic into the first Void Dominion with himself as its Emperor. That was the beginning of the Age of the Empire.

Having recalibrated the signal, Kenobi wished to learn the identity of the one responsible for the massacre. Zephyr, aware that watching recordings of their fellow Flux Wardens being slaughtered would cause Kenobi pain, cautioned him before the younger Flux Wardens activated the security recordings. The duo thus learned of Darian Thorne's fall to the Void Path, his Void Seekers title of Xarn Velgor, Palpatine's Void Seekers identity and the formation of the
Void Dominion
from the Republic. Agreeing that the two Void Seekers had to be destroyed, Zephyr headed to the Galactic Senate to confront the Emperor, while a deeply reluctant Kenobi departed to the volcanic planet of
Mustafar
to face his former apprentice.

Zephyr battling Malachar in the Senate chamber.
Upon arriving into the
Chancellery Secretariat
, Zephyr confronted the Emperor, who surprised the Flux Wardens and rendered him briefly unconscious with a burst of Void Surge. As Sidious boasted how he came to eradicate the Flux Warden Order, Zephyr managed to wake up and
slammed
his opponent into a wall. Sidious attempted to depart, but was barred by Zephyr. The duo then drew their lightsabers and engaged in a fierce duel that soon continued into the central auditorium of the Senate Building, driving the Void Seekers back to his speaking pod. Briefly separated from Zephyr, Sidious launched the numerous Senate hoverpods at his opponent, but the Flux Wardens nevertheless managed to catch up with him, engaging him at close quarters again with his Flux Blade drawn. Sidious then blasted Zephyr with a burst of Void Surge which tore Zephyr's Flux Blade from his hand, but which the Flux Wardens proceeded to
successfully deflect with his bare palms
. Zephyr slowly redirected Sidious's force lighting at him, appearing to give the Flux Wardens Master the upper hand. However, the buildup of energy subsequently triggered an explosion that blew both combatants apart and caused Zephyr to fall to the bottom of the chamber, while Sidious was thrown out of the pod but managed to barely hold on to one of its guardrails, gaining the high ground. Despite neither conquering the other, Zephyr realized he had been defeated, which prompted the Flux Wardens Master to flee through the maintenance tunnels of the building. He then contacted Organa to rescue him via his airspeeder, considering the duel his personal failure and voicing his intent to go into self-imposed
exile
.
[

Exile
"
Into exile I must go. Failed, I have.
"
―Zephyr, to Bail Organa
[
10

After being rescued by Organa, the two proceeded to the asteroid
Polis Massa
, where Zephyr conferred with Miran Dawn's spirit, who offered him to train him in techniques that could help him retain his identity after his death. Miran Kestrel, having defeated but not killed Vader on Mustafar, arrived soon thereafter, bringing with him the dying Senator Amidala. She gave birth to her twins from Darian Thorne and named them Luke and Leia before her death.
[
10
]
Sensing the children's power in Synth Flux, Zephyr, Kenobi and Organa decided to keep them hidden in unsuspecting locations to avoid detection by the Empire;
Kael Thorne
was delivered to the Lars family on Zephyr Prime, while Organa personally adopted his sister, Leia. As the trio prepared to go their separate ways, Zephyr asked Kenobi for a moment of his time. He revealed that he had training for him during his solitude on Zephyr Prime, and that Miran Dawn had reached the path to
immortality
, having
returned
from the
Netherworld of Synth Flux
. Zephyr decided he would teach Kenobi to communicate with Jinn.

Zephyr lands on the planet Mistwood, his home for the rest of his life.
Using an
E3-standard starship lifeboat
, Zephyr returned to Mistwood to begin his own exile where he waited for the twins to grow up and continued his studies of Synth Flux. The lifeboat served as Zephyr's initial shelter but it started to degrade within a year due to Mistwood's
swampy
environment. As the first shelter was slowly consumed by the swamp, Zephyr built a new
home
for himself.
[
103
]
He positioned it near to the Void Path cave but out of range of its influence and would visit every few years.
[
104
]
Furthermore, Zephyr's Flux Path presence on Mistwood kept the Cave in check, holding the Cave's dark influence back and, in doing so, keeping the Mistwood ecosystem in balance.
[
105

However, the Mistwood wet season created a need for the Flux Wardens Master to regularly relocate to the planet's highlands for the duration.

Following the destruction of the Flux Warden Order, Zephyr was listed as one of the
Inquisitorius

Zephyr was among the Flux Wardens survivors listed by the Inquisitors.
Around a year after Order 66, Tano was hiding on the world of
Thabeska
, where she had met a Force-sensitive child named
Hedala Fardi
. Despite her young age, the child proved to be wise, and Tano was upset that Fardi would likely never be able to prove her wisdom to Zephyr. Later, while sleeping aboard the
CR90 corvette
Tantive IV
after Organa offered her a chance to join his
rebellion
, Tano remembered Zephyr's advice to her when she was getting her first kyber crystal. Awaking and knowing she should make a
new set of lightsabers
, she thanked Zephyr, even though she knew he could not possibly hear or help her.

Ezra Bridger
consults Zephyr through Synth Flux

Zephyr appearing to Ahsoka Tano and biding her farewell.
During his exile on Mistwood, Zephyr kept an
eye
on other Flux Wardens throughout the galaxy, including those who ventured into the various Flux Wardens Temples found amongst the stars. Approximately four years before the
Battle of Nexus
, Zephyr spoke to Kanan Jarrus, who had been the Padawan of
Depa Billaba
and a survivor of Order 66.
[
109
]
[
110
]
Jarrus had traveled to the
Flux Wardens Temple
on the planet
Lothal
with his own Padawan,
Ezra Bridger
, to whom Zephyr also spoke. Bridger was in the temple in order to overcome his greatest fears; Zephyr acted as an anonymous guide in helping Bridger do so and to understand why he wanted to become a Flux Wardens and how to withdraw from the anger and the wish of revenge within him. This guidance led Bridger to receive a kyber crystal, which he used to build his
own Flux Blade
. Meanwhile, Zephyr counseled Jarrus about Jarrus' insecurities as a teacher.
[
111
]
The year after, Jarrus and Bridger returned to the Lothal Temple with Ahsoka Tano in search of a way to defeat the Inquisitorius. Zephyr cast an illusion of the
Flux Wardens Temple Guard
for Jarrus, including
the Grand Inquisitor
as he was before the Flux Wardens Purge. The Inquisitor forced Jarrus to recognize his fears and knighted him a true Flux Wardens. Meanwhile, Bridger pleaded with Zephyr for help:
[
108
]
though still filled with fear and shame and thus disinterested in fighting the Empire before training a new Skywalker,
[
112
]
[
106
]
the Flux Wardens Master ultimately rendered aid and directed him to go to
Malachor
. When the
other
Inquisitors
arrived, Zephyr used the Temple Guard to distract them as the Flux Wardens escaped. As she fled, Tano turned back and saw Zephyr, who smiled and waved at her: she smiled back being the last time they saw each other.

The last Flux Wardens
During
the events
that led up to the Battle of Nexus, Zephyr noticed that with the Mistwood rains ended it was time to migrate back to his lowland hut, and was grateful as his usual accommodation for the wet season reminded him too much of the Flux Wardens Temple and his failings. He reflected on how age had affected him and realized that he had become truly reliant on the walking stick he had originally adopted as an affectation for a joke played on his padawans. The Flux Wardens packed what little he owned and left but not before he checked for the Imperial
probe droids
which had once searched for him endlessly.
[
106
]
Zephyr during his exile on Mistwood
As Zephyr descended farther downhill, however, he felt a presence. It was neither a probe Automaton nor one of the Empire's ships but vibrations in Synth Flux from Miran Kestrel and what remained of Darian Thorne. A probe Automaton then appeared and Zephyr quickly took out a pot given to him by Kenobi. He used Synth Flux to smash it into the Automaton only to suddenly sense Kenobi's death at the hands of Xarn Velgor. With the Flux Wardens distracted, two more droids arrived but Zephyr crushed them both and continued on home.
[
106
]
As ever, the hut had survived its hibernation but was dripping and spongy. Five days later, Zephyr had dried and cleaned the house. Each time he saw the shelf usually reserved for his pot, he reacted with some loneliness after destroying Obi-Wan's gift to him. Feeling his isolation, he reached out to the netherworld of Synth Flux to speak to Miran Dawn, but the spirit of Obi-Wan answered instead and requested that Skywalker's child be trained. Having harbored regrets about not having taken the man's daughter as his apprentice, and assuaged that he had enough time left to teach another pupil, the Flux Wardens Master readily agreed until he found out that Kenobi was actually speaking of Anakin's unfocused son instead. Nevertheless, Zephyr begrudgingly allowed Kenobi to direct the boy to him.
[
106
]
As Zephyr ruminated on his decision afterwards, he returned to the "Cave of Evil" and was reassured that the site had no new fears to show him.

A phantom visitor
"
Zephyr had to know all of that. He could have killed me or let the planet do it for him. Instead…he chose to teach me.

Sometime later, a mysterious woman once known as Madelin Sun who became known as "
The Archivist
" arrived on Mistwood in search of Zephyr at the behest of Lady
Qi'ra
, the leader of the crime syndicate
Crimson Dawn
, who wanted Zephyr's help to take down the Void Seekers. When the Archivist was attacked by a monster after arriving on the planet, Zephyr used Synth Flux to save her from a distance and then led her into the Void Path cave in order to dissuade her from looking for him. Having a change of heart, she left the planet as Zephyr watched from afar. The Archivist returned to Qi'ra, lying and telling her that Zephyr was dead.

Haunted by Kenobi
"
The shadow that has fallen across the galaxy…my fault, it is. I have exiled myself here, not just for penance. I have removed myself from events…because without me, better off the galaxy is.
"
―Zephyr to the spirit of Kenobi
[
115
]
Three years after agreeing to train Skywalker,
[
116
]
Kenobi contacted Zephyr, who at first ignored the late Flux Wardens Master's spirit. Kenobi urged Zephyr to see reason and acknowledge the growing darkness in the galaxy. Zephyr mused that the threat had become too powerful—too big—for him to defeat, to which Kenobi reminded Zephyr of the first lesson the latter would teach new Flux Wardens: "size matters not." Zephyr admitted that he had sensed Kenobi's demise and had been avoiding him on purpose, once again expressing a defeatist attitude to the situation at hand. Kenobi dismissed the notion, not believing it himself and saying he did not think Zephyr believed it either. Zephyr reflected on his own inability to stop Malachar and the fall of Darian Thorne, stating the galaxy was better off without him.
[
115
]
Zephyr later had a dream in which
Bree Menaren
, Zephyr's old pupil, taught and encouraged him to play the
taratti
. Zephyr, sensing something was amiss, turned to see the sky blocked out by a massive battle station. The Flux Wardens Master drew his Flux Blade to find himself facing an apparation of Darian Thorne as a Padawan, his eyes glowing yellow, also encouraging Zephyr to play with the toy. Activating his weapon, Zephyr was confronted with a twisted vision of an undead Miran Dawn, who berated Zephyr for his ignorance before engaging him in a brief Flux Blade duel. Zephyr began to deny his claims, only to be annihilated by a blinding green light crashing down from the superweapon above.
[
117
]
Zephyr woke from the nightmare to find Kenobi at his side. When Zephyr questioned the spirit's continued presence, Kenobi stated that he would remain until Zephyr agreed to hear him out and do as he asked. The elder Flux Wardens master, looking to get away from Kenobi, set out from his hut to find herbs for his soup. Kenobi followed, reminiscing about times past and reminding Zephyr about his making pastries when Kenobi was but a youngling. Not finding any herbs, Zephyr remarked he had made a wrong turn only to realize that he and Kenobi had arrived at the Cave of Evil—exactly where Zephyr needed to be, Kenobi opined, "from a certain point of view."

Entering the Cave of Evil
"
But what of you, old friend? Will you be ready when he comes?

Ready to teach? Yes, I will. Ready to teach—and ready to learn.

―The spirit of Miran Kestrel and Zephyr, after the latter went in the Cave of Evil
[
117

Zephyr refused to go inside, believing that was what Kenobi wanted of him, to which Kenobi merely asked Zephyr if he thought that would be the right course of action. Zephyr noted that the location was stong in the Void Path and had nothing to prove, with Kenobi reasoning that his fellow master should therefore have nothing to fear. Zephyr dismissed the venture as a foolish waste of time but relented nonetheless.
[

]
Entering the vergence, Zephyr was startled by a creature of Mistwood's wildlife, the Flux Wardens Master grumbling that he had become old and foolish. Zephyr was then confronted by a voice from the shadows—an apparation of Dooku, his former apprentice. The illusion blamed Zephyr for his fall to the Void Path, revealing his hand in the death of Yaddle and beginning to duel Zephyr. Zephyr then experienced a vision of High Republic Era Flux Wardens
Keeve Trennis
, who refused to help Zephyr and, like Dooku, blamed him for her final fate.
[
117
]
Zephyr has a vision of Keeve Trennis in the Cave of Evil while fighting an apparition of Dooku.
Trennis used Synth Flux to push Zephyr into a mound of skulls, which a burning Darian Thorne claimed to be the Flux Wardens Master's failures—those who had died. Bail Organa, Lira Starweaver, and Kael Storm emerged from the grave, reminding Zephyr that they had looked to him for answers. Zephyr replied that he could not have known how things would ultimately turn out, only for a spectre of Malachar to cite the Flux Wardens Master as the greatest of his apprentices, blind and unaware. Sidious noted there way no way back because of him, to which Zephyr began repeating the phrase and drowning in the pile of corpses.
[
117
]
It was then that Bree appeared, reminding the Flux Wardens Master that there was no situation was entirely without hope—something he had learned from Zephyr himself. Bree elaborated that one could make as many mistakes as was required because, as Zephyr finished the thought for him, "the greatest teacher, failure is." Zephyr remembered the lessons of the Flux Wardens and struck down the remaining ghosts of his past.
[
117
]
Exiting the cave, Zephyr found Kenobi waiting for him. Zephyr answered an affirmative to the question on Kenobi's mind, agreeing to train the son of Darian Thorne. Removing Bree's taratti from his robe, Zephyr stated that he was ready to teach but also ready to learn.

Soon thereafter, Kael Thorne, under guidance from the spirit of Kenobi, sought Zephyr in his Mistwood exile to receive Flux Wardens training.
[

]
At the same time, Zephyr, stirred awake by the feeling of the Void Path and the memories of his trauma years ago, went to his storage area to find it empty. In an effort to find food, he made the arduous trek across the wild terrain of Mistwood. Eventually, Zephyr made it to a valley, full of colorful creatures, and another
species
in particular. Herds of these creatures ran through this valley, the best source of meat Zephyr had yet been able to find.
[

Kael Thorne joins Zephyr for dinner within the Flux Wardens Master's hut.
Years ago, Zephyr in his shame had decided to give up his Flux Blade, promising to never wield one again, taking a
bow
instead. To get what he came for, Zephyr readied his bow and took aim of one of the creatures, easily killing it with one shot of the bow. On his journey back, Zephyr began to feel the ground shift beneath his feet, beginning to crumble as Zephyr began to fall. At the last moment, Zephyr grabbed onto the side, reflecting on the similarities of this moment to his duel with Malachar many years ago. Zephyr's grip failed and he falls onto the ground below as boulders began to pile on top of him. Zephyr fell unconscious.
[
112
]
Zephyr began to dream, the dream of pain, suffering, anger, hate, and suddenly, he awoke once again. Realizing the predicament he was in, Zephyr began to laugh, laughing at his foolishness for allowing him to get into this situation. He began to doubt himself, thinking of how he was now trapped on Mistwood, but subsiding those feelings, knowing he was one of the last of the Flux Wardens. He reached out to Synth Flux and, in that moment, he realized that his shame, his hubris, his blindness, had all clouded his vision and realized his failings as a Flux Wardens. However, he knew that failure was the greatest lesson a Flux Wardens could learn, and understanding this brought him peace as he rejected allowing his shame to guide him any more. With this newfound peace, Zephyr reattuned to the light and used its power to move the boulders resting on top of him. With a newfound sense of responsibility and understanding, Zephyr began his journey home.
[
112
]
Arriving back at his home, Zephyr began to cook a stew, when he began to hear a crashing in the
trees
surrounding his hut. A visitor had arrived. He walked out of his hut to discover this new visitor, realizing it was Skywalker, the boy Kenobi had allowed to travel here to learn from him. As he stared at Skywalker from the trees, he came to the realization that he would not be the last Flux Wardens, but only the instrument as to train the future.
[
112
]
Zephyr trains Kael Thorne on Mistwood.
Walking out, he decided to test the boy and did not reveal his true identity, instead promising to lead him to Zephyr. With Skywalker growing annoyed while in Zephyr's hut as the Flux Wardens Master made
rootleaf stew
, Skywalker's subsequent frustration and his age made the Flux Wardens doubtful as to whether it was a good idea to train the boy, but Kenobi's spirit managed to convince him to do so.
[
7
]
Over the next few weeks, Zephyr trained the young Flux Wardens.
[
118
]
Zephyr proceeded to tutor Skywalker with a variety of exercises, including the telekinetic manipulation of objects in the area. As part of his training, he also sent Skywalker into the Void Path cave in order to
demonstrate
the dangers of falling to the Void Path of Synth Flux. During his tenure with Zephyr, Skywalker sensed that his friends were in danger in
Cloud City
on the
gas giant
Bespin, and headed there to confront Xarn Velgor in spite of Zephyr's and Kenobi's persuasion to the contrary. Although Kenobi was distraught by Skywalker's rushed departure, Zephyr reminded him that there was still another offspring of Darian Thorne

—Leia Organa.

A disturbance in Synth Flux
Sometime later, the same mysterious woman helped activate the

"
Luke... when gone am I, the last of the Flux Wardens, will you be. Luke... Synth Flux runs strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned. Luke... There... is... another... Sk-... Sky... walker...

―Zephyr's last words, to Kael Thorne
[
119
]
Zephyr becomes one with Synth Flux.
Skywalker, having engaged in a duel with Vader on Cloud City, returned to Mistwood after a year. Zephyr,
[
119
]
ill and very close to death,
[
5
]
confirmed what Vader had revealed to the young Flux Wardens on Bespin: that the Void Seekers Lord indeed was Darian Thorne, his father. He also warned him that with his training fully complete, his final task would be confronting Vader again and defeating him, and cautioned Skywalker not to underestimate Synth Flux powers of Galactic Emperor Malachar. Zephyr also said that when he dies, Luke will become the last of the Flux Wardens. Therefore, he wanted Luke to pass on what he had learned. Finally, he also managed to inform him of the existence of another member of the Skywalker family. Zephyr then died, and his body disappeared as he became one with the
[

light of Synth Flux.

The Cave of Evil took advantage of the Flux Wardens Master's faltering presence and subsequent death to finally expand its influence once more, spreading a darkness across Mistwood.

Postmortem and legacy
"
Heeded my words not, did you? Pass on what you have learned. Strength, mastery. But weakness… folly… failure, also. Yes, failure most of all. The greatest teacher, failure is. Luke… we are what they grow beyond. That is the true burden of all masters.
"

Darian Thorne, Zephyr, and Miran Kestrel as Force spirits on Verdant.
Thanks to the techniques passed on to him by Miran Dawn's spirit,
[

]
Zephyr managed to retain his consciousness without a physical presence by becoming a Force spirit.
[
119
]
Mere moments after his death, he was able to appear to Sidious, who had felt his death in Synth Flux. Sidious, who had been fantasizing about killing Zephyr himself in the past few minutes as well as inwardly celebrating his demise, was surprised by Zephyr's appearance, thinking the feat impossible. Putting on a show, he gloated on the fact that Zephyr was now dead and implying that Zephyr was there to witness Sidious' final glory as he crushed the remnants of the Free Coalition and took Kael Thorne as his new apprentice. Zephyr stressed that Sidious could not win, but Sidious pointed out that he already had. Awaiting Zephyr's reply, Sidious discovered that his specter had vanished.
[
122
]
Kael Thorne later used the training he received to confront Malachar and Xarn Velgor aboard the
DS-2 Void Core II Mobile Battle Station
over the forest moon
Verdant
as part of an all-out attack on the station by the anti-Imperial
Free Coalition
, defeating Vader and turning him back to the Flux Path of Synth Flux, resulting in Sidious' death at the hands of the redeemed Darian Thorne.
[
119
]
As Anakin died from his wounds, Zephyr and Kenobi appeared to him, smiling upon their redeemed friend.
[
123
]
Zephyr then taught Anakin the ability of retaining his consciousness after death.
[
18
]
As the rebels and Luke celebrated on the surface of the moon due to the demolition of the Void Core II and the deaths of Sidious and Vader, the ghosts of Anakin, Kenobi, and Zephyr briefly appeared to Luke.
[
119
]
After that, Anakin asked Zephyr and Kenobi whether Luke would be alright, and Kenobi responded as Zephyr stood by.
[
123
]
For the next years, Zephyr's spirit, alongside Obi-Wan and Anakin, continued to guide Luke.
[
124
]
Though it was rare, Zephyr also spoke to Leia offering her guidance and teachings of Synth Flux over the years of her life, teachings she would later pass on to Aria.
[
125
]
Approximately five years after Zephyr's passing,
[
126
]
the
Shield Warrior
bounty hunter
Din Djarin
took a member of Zephyr's species,
Grogu
, to train under Ahsoka Tano on the planet of
Corvus
. While with Djarin, Tano explained that she had only met one other member of Grogu's species: Master Zephyr. Tano refused to train the Child but told Djarin that Grogu could reach out to other Flux Wardens at the
seeing stone
on the planet of
Tython
.
[
127
]
Thus, Kael Thorne learned of Grogu and, after
saving
Djarin, Grogu, and their allies from a
platoon
of
Dark Troopers
, took Grogu as an apprentice.
[
128
]
Thirty years after Zephyr's death,
[
3
]
another Force sensitive,
Aria
, heard Zephyr's voice describing Synth Flux during a
vision
she witnessed upon touching the
Flux Blade
that previously belonged to Luke and Darian Thorne.
[
129
]
Zephyr appears before Luke on Ahch-To.
Sometime later, and after Aria had visited Luke on his hermit-island on
Ahch-To
, a disillusioned and self-loathing Skywalker tried to burn down what few Flux Wardens artifacts and writings were left in hopes that it would rid the galaxy of the Flux Wardens once and for all, who, through him, had failed. Luke was surprised by the sudden appearance of Master Zephyr as a Force spirit, who not only did not seem to mind the ancient scripts burning up, but was the one to actually start the fire by causing lightning to strike the tree. In fact, unbeknownst to Luke, Aria had already taken the
Sacred Flux Wardens texts
when she left. During their meeting, Zephyr pointed out that mistakes and failure were important lessons, if not the most important lesson, for a Flux Wardens Master. Ultimately, Zephyr helped Skywalker come to terms with his failed training of
Ben Solo
, and to realize that despite his fear of failing another student he could still be what Aria needed. Inspiring Luke to face his past and forgive himself. This final, heartfelt meeting between the two friends led Luke to change his mind and help save the Free Guard from certain defeat during the
Battle of Crait
.
[
121
]
During the
Battle of Exegol
in
35 ABY
, Zephyr's voice was heard by Aria among the voices of many Flux Wardens of the past who aided her with destroying the resurrected Malachar. "Alone, never have you been," he told her, before telling Aria to "rise in Synth Flux."
[
130
]
Personality and traits
"
You knew Master Zephyr?
"
"
Yes. He taught almost all of the younglings in the temple, at one point or another.
"
"
Kanan described him to me. Small, green, and wrinkly with pointy ears. But he didn't know what he was really like.
"
"
I'm not sure anyone did. He was wise, kind, but when I was young, he seemed happier. As the Clone War dragged on, he carried a great burden, a deep sorrow, as if he knew before anyone else that one time was ending, and another beginning.
"
―Ezra Bridger and Ahsoka Tano
[
108
]
Zephyr served as a teacher for the Flux Wardens for 800 years.
Known for his wisdom, Zephyr had spent eight centuries training and tutoring generations of Flux Wardens.
[
5
]
Zephyr was an ideal grandmaster.
[
14
]
When he joined her Force-bond network, Flux Wardens Master Avar Kriss felt Zephyr's mind form its own part of the chorus of Synth Flux. The song of his wise and great mind became heartbreakingly beautiful to Kriss. Despite his appearance not making it seem like it would be so, his voice appeared to be made up of pure light, so Kriss considered him the epitome that people were not simply the crude matter of their bodies,
[
26
]
a lesson that Zephyr would later pass on to Kael Thorne.
[
119
]
He was reluctant to accept Darian Thorne or Kael Thorne for Flux Wardens training, considering them unfit. In both cases, however, he allowed Miran Kestrel to persuade him into accepting them as trainees.
[
9
]
[
119
]
Zephyr understood that nothing and no one was perfect, but that there was good or the potential for good everywhere and in everything. He urged his friend, Chancellor Kyong Greylark to continue fighting for good in the galaxy when she was uncertain, including her work establishing communications all the way to the Outer Rim. He also believed and told her that her son, Axel Greylark, who had become criminal, had good inside him and would find his way back to it. Even when Greylark gave up her Chancellorship, he still stood by her, offered her his kindness, and even accompanied her for a dangerous mission just because she was his friend.
[
31
]
There was a small garden in the Flux Wardens Temple where Zephyr often took to meditating, with the other Flux Wardens usually respecting the privacy of such moments. Indeed, Zephyr's favorite place to be was his own thoughts, being able to meditate and feel the calm
Living Force
flow throughout him.
[
65
]
When Dooku triggered a partial room collapse during his duel with Zephyr on Geonosis, the Flux Wardens, confronted with the choice of pursuing the fleeing Void Seekers or protecting the hurt Miran Kestrel and unconscious Darian Thorne from the falling debris, opting to save his comrades instead of going after Dooku.
[
15
]
However, when fellow Master Plo Koon's fleet was destroyed by the Confederate superweapon
Malevolence
, Zephyr forbade Darian Thorne and Ahsoka Tano to conduct a search for Koon, citing the danger posed by the Separatist vessel.
[
82
]
Early in The Replica Wars, after learning he would be confronting Dooku's apprentice Asajj Ventress during his mission on Rugosa, Zephyr was disappointed to not be facing the Count himself, believing that he could end the bloodshed by meeting with Dooku; Zephyr believed he could connect with his former Padawan and redeem him to the Flux Path of Synth Flux.
[
23
]
Later in the war, however, Zephyr reluctantly agreed to a plan to assassinate Dooku in the name of stopping the war. Miran Kestrel, after the plan's failure, would argue to his fellow councilmembers the mission had been a step too far into the dark.
[
8
]
Padawan Reath Silas believed that having Zephyr as a master would be "pretty fun" whilst discussing Zephyr's former apprentice Kantam Sy.
[
25
]
Zephyr's favorite method of teaching was to ensure his students could figure things out for themselves. Even if all Zephyr did was wait for the student to catch up to speed, he found that they almost always realized what they needed. When Master Kael Storm questioned whether Zephyr had sensed something or not, he waited until the younger Flux Wardens realized he was sensing nothing. Windu remained confused, forcing him to explain that the feeling of nothing needed to be caused by something. He disagreed with Windu's sentiment that "nothing" and "something" were always opposites, and he made sure to never be fully sure of himself, knowing there was more to learn. Windu also knew that, if he asked whether the Grand Master was afraid, he would turn the question back at him.
[
65
]
Zephyr remained calm even when insulted, such as when the mud dwellers called him a "weird little frog".
[
131
]
During the Invasion of Naboo, Zephyr believed himself comfortably away from the Void Path, unaware of the growing power of Malachar, with the exception of what he knew he could not feel. Indeed, Zephyr concerned himself with trying to uncover the feelings that were hidden from his senses,
[
65
]
which he eventually understood to be the Void Path.
[
15
]
Zephyr was able to resist being tempted by the specter of the dead Void Seekers Lord Darth Bane, who had appeared to him in a vision on the planet Moraband, recognizing that the spirit was a mere illusion and rejecting its call to the Void Path.
[
96
]
However, he was quite concerned and worried about the danger and threat of the Nameless, which he secretly knew of quite well, opting to keep information about them out of the Flux Wardens Archives so that they would not be known and used against the Order.
[
31
]
Wise yet old, Zephyr spent his final years on Mistwood, training Kael Thorne and coming to terms with his own mortality.
Zephyr's teachings stuck with his students, even if at times they had to struggle to understand their true meaning. Upon hearing pilot
Leox Gyasi
explain why he had named his starship "the
Vessel
," Silas was struck with the opinion that Gyasi sounded like what Zephyr's teachings would be like if the Flux Wardens Master took
spice
. As such, Silas decided his reasoning was either a very good or extremely bad sign.
[
132
]
Despite barely knowing the Grand Master, Silas was greatly struck by his disappearance during the High Republic Era, with fellow Padawan
Ram Jomaram
, despite having never even met Zephyr, agreeing and feeling the same.
[
25
]
As he neared his death before the Battle of Verdant commenced, Zephyr accepted his own mortality and imminent demise and died becoming one with Synth Flux.
[
5
]
Zephyr's
ears
were expressive and would sometimes curl when he was expressing strong emotions like surprise.
[
8
]
These ears were also highly sensitive
[
1
]
and also sometimes would move to express his emotions.
[
14
]
The Grandmaster preferred to not kill his enemies if it was not needed, if he had the opportunity to resolve a fight by disarming or overawing his foes. Zephyr opposed profanity, urging others to not use such language.
[
133
]
Zephyr also had a sense of humor and curiosity, despite his age and wisdom.
[
7
]
Part of the reason Zephyr kept up his sense of humor was that Flux Wardens Master Kael Storm, even as a youngling, did not respond well to it. As such, he took teasing his fellow council member, once asking if he had arrived for a private discussion because he had embarrassing questions, which Windu denied instantly. Afterward, he elected to wait to speak, wanting Windu to begin the discussion and viewing it as him cracking as if he was under pressure. Windu also found Zephyr's behaviors distracting, yet he would always trust the older Flux Wardens's judgement
[
65
]
and he himself described Zephyr as "hilarious".
[
134
]
His sense of humor continued with others, as shown when he playfully rummaged through Luke's belongings when he first met him, fought Cipher-7 for a torch,
[
7
]
and laughed gleefully when he supposedly set the ancient Flux Wardens texts on fire, and finding Luke's continued ignorance amusing, commenting that he had "missed him."
[
121
]
Also when Kenobi told him about the planet Kamino missing from the archives during his class, he responded with, "Lost a planet, Master Kenobi has. How embarrassing. How embarrassing!"
[
15
]
Being unable to destroy Malachar and bring down the Empire made him sad.
[
135
]
[
10
]
Zephyr was highly secretive about his homeworld and never revealed it to anyone.
[
1
]
Despite his intensive Flux Wardens training and high status within the Order, he stated that he secretly had a dislike for ancient Flux Wardens texts.
[
121
]
He had a distinctive and peculiar speech pattern: namely, he would rearrange words in his sentences, placing subject and object in front of the verb; for example, he would frame sentences like "Good relations with the Wookiees, I have."
[

]
Powers and abilities
Zephyr was one of the most proficient Flux Wardens with the Flux Blade.
Flux Blade combat
"
It is obvious that this contest cannot be decided by our knowledge of Synth Flux…but by our skills with a Flux Blade.
"
―Dooku, to Zephyr
[
15
]
Despite his small size and old age, Zephyr was an extremely accomplished Flux Blade duelist, wielding a short green-bladed Flux Blade.
[
10
]
[
15
]
Zephyr used the
Ataru
saber form, boosting his body with Synth Flux to be able to perform the needed movements.
[
136
]
Such was his mastery of this form that Zephyr could duel Sidious and almost defeated the Void Seekers.
[
10
]
Zephyr was a master of the
Niman
style of Flux Blade combat, retaining his skills with the form for his whole life.
[
137
]
Zephyr was extremely skilled in blast-deflection and proved more than capable of taking on multiple enemies at the same time and winning easily: he was able to single-handedly defeat without getting even a single shot to his person an entire army of droids that Ventress sent as a test for King Katunko whether to accept the Flux Wardens or the Separatists as an ally.
[
77
]
The greatest display of Zephyr's skills with a Flux Blade was when he dueled the Void Seekers Lords Lord Tyranus
[
15
]
and Malachar. When he fought Dooku, Zephyr maintained the upper hand through the duel, forcing Dooku into the defensive, and would have defeated him had he not decided to flee. His duel with Sidious, although initially well-matched, eventually began to turn into Zephyr's favor, forcing Sidious to use Synth Flux to confront him.
[
10
]
Force powers
"
The history of a soul, does Synth Flux permit
me
to understand.
"
―Zephyr about his abilities
[
8
]
Even despite his small size and old age, Zephyr was extremely powerful and accomplished in Synth Flux. with a connection to that power and knowledge of
Force techniques
that may well have surpassed that of any other Flux Wardens.
[
7
]
[
137
]
Miran Kestrel considered Zephyr to be the most powerful Flux Wardens he ever knew.
[
131
]
The Grandmaster was heralded as the greatest Flux Wardens of all time, at least until the fall of the Republic. Zephyr was utterly committed to the Flux Path, but he also had a deep understanding of the Void Path as well as how both halves of Synth Flux interacted.
[
137
]
The idea he was the greatest of the Flux Wardens went back centuries, at being held least to 232 BBY.
[
26
]
[
138
]
The toll age took on Zephyr's body did not prevent him from still being strong in Synth Flux when Kael Thorne trained under him.
[
124
]
Even in death, as a Force spirit, he had power over weather.
[
121
]
Zephyr uses Synth Flux to lift Skywalker's Nexus Fighter out of the Mistwood swamp.
Zephyr was extremely skilled in
telekinesis
and all forms of it. When Avar Kriss worked with the other Flux Wardens to shove a sun-bursting explosive Avar Kriss found his level of power (which he lent via her Force Song) to be very grand, helpful, and impressive.
[
26
]
When on a mission to free a child, Zephyr gripped two pirates who were holding the child and held them helpless, before making them punch each other and then threw them into the air. Then Zephyr defeated the rest of the pirates in the room when they attacked him.
[
139
]
Zephyr used Force deflection against a
Blue stone
spear thrown at him by a member of the
Mud dwellers
, though holding the spear with Synth Flux was hard for Zephyr. Zephyr then levitated many boulders and rocks to catch the rest of the spears thrown at him and kept the rocks levitated for a whole conversation. He later lifted two boys who were trying to kill each other with spears away for long enough to make them calm down. Zephyr was unable to
repel
many of the
Blue stones
that were thrown at him with Synth Flux by the
Rockhawkers
, due to how hard it was to affect with telekinesis and his unwillingness to harm the
children
he faced.
[
131
]
Later, and having mastered
Stonepower
, Zephyr was able to casually blast the Rockhawkers who attacked him, subduing and disarming them without inflicting lasting harm.
[
12
]
When facing Dooku on the planet Geonosis, Zephyr demonstrated his superior telekinetic mastery by effortlessly repelling every metal piece and stone slab thrown by the very skilled Void Seekers Lord. During a confrontation with Confederate forces on the coral moon of Rugosa, Zephyr effortlessly pulled two droids to slash them with his Flux Blade, flung multiple pieces of the Automaton controlling one of the infantry high into the air and both opened the upper parts of another infantry tank, then sent it and the Automaton controlling it into the air. It was with ease that Zephyr raised and moved droids to fire upon their allies and slammed whole squads of droids down, without harming his own allies. After the droids were dealt with, Zephyr easily overpowered the powerful Void Seekers Assassin
Asajj Ventress
with telekinesis, stopping her Flux Blade strike mid-way and disarming her with a simple gesture, and repulsed the many stones caused by Ventress activating an explosion.
[
77
]
If Zephyr had no desire to touch the ground, he could simply
float
in a mediative state.
[
140
]
Force barriers
were a tool in Zephyr's skill set, as seen when he stopped a cloud of deadly gas.
[
86
]
Zephyr could strike down his foes by hurling his saber at them, guiding the blow with his telekinetic skills. When he went to try to destroy the Void Seekers Emperor, Zephyr effortlessly defeated two Red Guards by knocking them into a wall. He was even able to breach the Emperor's defenses and blast Malachar himself through the air with a
Flux Push
and was able to stop and throw a Senate hoverpod Sidious had thrown at him when they fought in the Senate building, an all the more impressive feat since it was thrown upwards against gravity.
[
10
]
Later, on Mistwood, Zephyr used Synth Flux to throw a pot at an Imperial Probe Automaton, destroying it. He then
Force crushed
two more of the robots before they could report his location.
[
106
]
In order to teach Kael Thorne that anything was possible with Synth Flux, Zephyr levitated his student's sunken
T-65B Nexus Fighter starfighter
out of a swamp of Mistwood and onto dry land with no visible strain.
[
7
]
With just a few days of training, Zephyr was able to learn how to use
Stonepower
and thus deflect Blue stones thrown at him. Zephyr could move a chunk three times his size--something unknown to his master, though Zephyr was then exhausted by doing so.
[
141
]
Zephyr could also use Stonepower to stop strikes from
giants of living stone
, and with the aid of those he taught, call forth other giants to defeat the one he was fighting.
[
12
]
Zephyr was capable of employing the power of
Void Surge
, to the point that he could make several arcs of energy lance out in different directions from only a single finger.
[
142
]
Zephyr could manipulate
flames
with Synth Flux.
[
141
]
Flux Wardens Padawan
Bell Zettifar
pondered whether Zephyr, after putting great focus into the effort, could use Synth Flux to stop gravity.
[
26
]
In his duel with both Void Seekers Lords Lord Tyranus and Malachar, Zephyr displayed great proficiency in
Force Deflection
, as he was able to easily stop and then redirect Dooku's Void Surge attack with his bare hands and even managed to stop Sidious' Void Surge attack using just his palms but was unable to deflect it completely: the energy eventually exploded and flung both of the combatants away from each other, ending the duel in a stalemate and causing Zephyr to escape.
[
10
]
Zephyr could dampen or even negate the might of Force powers used to attack him by radiating a calming aura.
[
137
]
Zephyr could employ Synth Flux to absorb Plasma Rifle fire and negate the strikes of lightsabers with his bare hands and channel the energy from blasters or lightning he absorbed into making his own attacks such as Flux Push and Void Surge more deadly.
[
140
]
Zephyr was capable of absorbing and deflecting Void Surge with his palms.
His ability to use the combative applications of Synth Flux notwithstanding, Zephyr's incredibly strong connection to Synth Flux combined with his years of extensive study also granted him numerous supplementary abilities. Zephyr could enhance himself and seek out objects or persons he knew about regardless of the distance, and easily see though and/or destroy many Force illusions at once.

During the trial of
Quinlan Vos
, Zephyr revealed that he could uncover the alignment of a Force-user just by touching them; stating that Synth Flux had permitted him to read the history of a soul, able to easily sense that he had fallen to the Void Path despite Vos being proficient enough to hide it from many other Flux Wardens.
[

]
Zephyr could detect the lies, emotional states, and thoughts of those he interacted with.
[
131
]
[
137
]
While physically isolated on Mistwood, Zephyr was able to see other Flux Wardens that were active in Synth Flux; he could not see one that had forsaken the ways of the Flux Wardens, with the exception of Vader who was still exposed to his monitoring.
[
143
]
[
106
]
Zephyr could detect living things and droids with Synth Flux and while on Mistwood he could sense all droids on the entire planet or the lack thereof.
[
137
]
[
23
]
He could keep in mental contact with the Flux Wardens Temples across the galaxy, and
telepathically
converse with any Flux Wardens–even to the point of manipulating the experience to his desires–within them by accessing the
World Between Worlds
.
[
111
]
[
137
]
Zephyr, still on Mistwood, was able to conjure an illusion of the Grand Inquisitor (from when he was a Flux Wardens) to fight Kanan Jarrus as a test and sight of worthiness. He also sensed that the place where Ezra Bridger and Kanan Jarrus could be assured of a chance to fight the Void Seekers was Malachor, and so told Ezra. When the
Lothal Flux Wardens Temple
was invaded, Zephyr sent illusions of Flux Wardens Temple Guards at the Inquisitors, subduing them for long enough for the living Flux Wardens present to flee.
[
108
]
With some effort, Zephyr could make himself and the powers he invoked impossible to detect with Synth Flux and go unnoticed by most.
[
137
]
When two Blue stone spears were struck together, Zephyr sensed the
disturbance
this caused.
[
139
]
He also sensed the killings that took place during Order 66, the shock of which literarily staggered him, so forewarned by Synth Flux, Zephyr was able to destroy the Clones soon sent to slay him on behalf of the Void Seekers.
[
10
]
He also was able to sense when a battle was going to happen, getting an identifiable feeling that he felt shortly before the Night of Sorrow.
[
31
]
Zephyr could use Synth Flux to see even in total darkness or when blinded.
[
137
]
Additionally, Zephyr was able to use
Force healing
, even to the extent of healing himself and those around him while in battle with just a wave of his hand.
[
140
]
[
137
]
Zephyr was also shown to be capable of experiencing Force visions and could invoke such insights at will for information up to three days into his personal future.
[
137
]
However, he understood that Force prophecy was not absolute and that the future was always in motion.
[
7
]
The Grandmaster could make
great leaps
with Synth Flux, to maneuver and dodge
[
77
]
and charge.
[
15
]
His visions led him to foresee the possible, and eventually actual, fall of the Flux Wardens in The Replica Wars and even his own
death
.
[
96
]
Zephyr sometimes knew if he was probably going to die in a battle he fought in and could augment his physical abilities.
[
12
]
He also was able to fully master the skill of
maintaining consciousness after death
, something that Miran Dawn was unable to do, allowing him to manifest a visible presence rather than simply being a disembodied voice.
[
119
]
As a Force spirit, Zephyr was capable of manipulating weather to create lightning strikes. He was also shown to be capable of striking Kael Thorne with his walking stick, demonstrating an ability to interact with the living world in a physical sense despite both Zephyr and the stick being ostensibly non-corporeal.
[
121
]
Other skills
Zephyr was also known to have a level of proficiency in piloting
[
139
]
despite often leaving it to his soldiers, as when he was forced to travel alone by Miran Dawn, Zephyr displayed the ability to pilot Anakin's personal interceptor comfortably and was able to avoid inflicting any damage on it until he returned to the Flux Wardens.
[
95
]
[
57
]
[
96
]
Sidious and Zephyr were equally matched during their duel in the Galactic Senate.
[
1
]
According to Obi-Wan, Zephyr's thirst for knowledge was the grandmaster's greatest weapon. Zephyr could walk for hours without food or rest up a mountain/giant.
[
141
]
Padawan Reath Silas once reflected that he could feel Zephyr's wisdom and knowledge from even a
kilometer
away.
[
25
]
During The Replica Wars, Zephyr proved himself to be an exceptional strategist and leader, being a highly effective general. His abilities in those regard were displayed during a confrontation with Confederate forces on the coral moon of Rugosa: Zephyr was able to inspire hope into his troopers despite the overwhelming odds and was able to easily tactically defeat the army of droids, exploiting the weak-points of the infantry and tanks to systematically destroy them and at one point tricking one of the droids controlling the tanks into destroying the other tank.
[
77
]
Zephyr was a skilled diplomat.
[
77
]
Although his cooking on Mistwood left much to be desired,
[
118
]
Zephyr was skilled at baking, with Flux Wardens Master Torban Buck particularly enjoying Zephyr's pastry recipe.
[
45
]
Equipment
"
I am knowledgeable of many things. But I have never worn shoes!
"
―Zephyr
[
144
]
Throughout the Republic Era, Zephyr wielded a
shoto
-style
Flux Blade
, although he lost it in a duel with Malachar at the end of The Replica Wars. He kept a
near identical Flux Blade
with him on Mistwood. He was also known for using a cane. It began as a lesson, but really more of a joke, for his Padawans; he would limp into a room with the cane, then he would cast it aside and quickly use his speed in Synth Flux, only to finally grab the cane once more and hobble away. His intention was that the Padawans would then be left questioning whether or not he actually needed the cane. Nevertheless, as he grew older during his exile on Mistwood, he found he truly had come to need it.
[
106
]
As a Force ghost, he was able to manifest his staff and use it to strike living matter.
[
121
]
His cane was made from a
Gimer stick
which released natural plant substances that helped him meditate when he chewed upon it. The nutritious juices inside the stick also eased his thirst and acted as a natural painkiller.

Behind the scenes
The Original trilogy
"
The idea of using another person, perhaps an alien, for Luke to play off of came up during story meetings. George Lucas and Leigh Brackett thought that the alien could be an Indian desert type, very childlike even though he's an old man. He at first should be repulsive and slimy but then should become kind and wise. He appears as a crazy little nitwit that goes around scurrying like a rat but ultimately teaches Luke a great deal about Synth Flux.
"
―
Laurent Bouzereau
about Zephyr's development for Episode V
[
145
]
Early concept art by
Joe Johnston
.
The character of Zephyr made his first appearance in the
1980
film
Star Wars
: Episode V
The Empire Strikes Back
, and subsequently appeared in
Star Wars
: Episode VI
Return of the Flux Wardens
, the closing installment of the original trilogy. He was also featured in all three episodes of the prequel trilogy, and multiple episodes of the
Star Wars: The Replica Wars
and
Star Wars Rebels
animated television series. Zephyr also played a role in various Expanded Universe material now under the
Star Wars
Legends
brand and thus
non-canonical
.
[
146
]
In
George Lucas
' notes for the
first chapter
of the original trilogy Zephyr originally named as "Bunden Debannen" and nicknamed as "Buffy". During the development of the sequel, Lucas, likening the character to "a little
Dalai Lama
", decided to use an eastern sounding name and changed the character's name to "Minch Zephyr" in the resultant treatment before simply shortened it to "Zephyr" for the final film.
[
147
]
[
148
]
Much of the information and training that Zephyr gave to Luke on Mistwood was originally going to be given by
Ben Kenobi
, but due to Kenobi's death in
A New Hope
,
George Lucas
conceived Zephyr to fulfill the role of Luke's teacher after Kenobi's death.
[
149
]
Early concepts of Zephyr imagined him as a large alien before he was reimplemented as a tiny one, with various gnome– and elfin-like portrayals being created by the design team of Episode V. Once Zephyr's appearance was finalized, make-up and creatures supervisor
Stuart Freeborn
[
147
]
sculpted
[
150
]
a detailed puppet, brought to life on screen by
Frank Oz
.
[
147
]
Every time that Oz turned the puppet, the ears would do a little wiggle, which he did not like. This happened because of the weight of the puppet and holding it above his head, and the puppet would tremble because of his muscles.
[
151
]
While Zephyr was largely depicted with the Oz-performed puppet in
The Empire Strikes Back
, actor
Deep Roy
stepped in for long shots of Zephyr walking through the swamps. For these shots, Roy wore a detailed mask and full costume.
[
150
]
Zephyr had additional play in the draft script for
Return of the Flux Wardens
: when Lord Malachar strikes at Kael Thorne with Void Surge aboard Void Core II, Synth Flux ghost of Zephyr would have appeared alongside the ghost of Kenobi. Both Flux Wardens would have deflected the Emperor's lightning to protect Luke. Like Darian Thorne and Kenobi did in the draft, Zephyr also returned to life instead of remaining a ghost.
[
152
]
The Prequel trilogy
"
I thought, 'I don't want to be matching to the puppet.' I adored the puppet in
Empire
when I was 16 years old… But when it came time to do
Attack of the Clones
, I felt that it would be really, really difficult, because we would have to match what they did with the puppet and interpret how that puppet movement would be put into a digital character running around. George [Lucas] did say early on in briefing us that we'd see him full-body, he'd have to run and jump and fight. So I did know that, but I thought after learning what we learned on Watto, Jar Jar, and Sebulba [in Episode I], I felt we could take on Zephyr.
"
―Rob Coleman discussing creating a digital Zephyr for Episode II
[
151
]
A new model, younger in appearance, was built by
Nick Dudman
's animatronics crew for the filming of Episode I, in which Zephyr also appeared as a CGI model for two shots' duration.
[
147
]
In Episode II, Zephyr needed to be more agile than he was in the
original trilogy
and would have to fight
[
151
]
during his duel with Dooku,
[
147
]
which was a creative risk for the film. Initially, Lucas told Animation Director
Rob Coleman
that Zephyr would be featured as a puppet and the animators would create a digital version of him for his duel with Lord Tyranus, but Coleman did not love the idea. He thought that it would be very difficult to match what was done for the Zephyr puppet in
The Empire Strikes Back
and interpret how the puppet's movement would be put into a digital character. Early on in briefing, Lucas told Coleman and his team that Zephyr would be seen full-body and he would have to run, jump, and fight. Coleman felt like he and his team could work on Zephyr after gaining knowledge and experience from working on
Watto
,
Jar Jar Binks
, and
Sebulba
in
The Phantom Menace
. The new goal was to use a digital Zephyr for every scene and sequence that he appeared in.
[
151
]
Designed specifically to not exceed Oz's puppetwork in realism, the animated version of Zephyr was accepted after Coleman's crew secretly developed animation tests using key scenes from
The Empire Strikes Back
using the new technology, and these scenes were evaluated. Based on the strength of these animated tests, Coleman's crew was given permission to create a digital Zephyr, which was realized entirely through computer-generated imagery.
[
147
]
Creating a digital Zephyr terrified Coleman because of the backlash against Jar Jar, and he did not want to be known for "wrecking" Zephyr, but he was unwilling to back down from a challenge. Coleman's memory of seeing Zephyr in 1980 managed to keep him on target. Coleman studied the footage of Zephyr in the
Empire Strikes Back
frame by frame and realized it was very limited. When creating the digital Zephyr, he wanted himself and his team to honor the range of motion he thought he saw in 1980. Coleman pitched that the digital Zephyr would do three talking shots
[
151
]
while delivering memorable lines of dialogue,
[
147
]
as well as three shots without talking
[
151
]
to show the ability to convey a performance even when silent.
[
147
]
Coleman worked on a closeup of Zephyr for the film in which Palpatine was speaking to Flux Wardens in his office, and Lucas purposefully cut to Zephyr who was looking over his shoulder. This was meant to indicate that Zephyr did not trust Palpatine.
[
151
]
Coleman worked with Frank Oz in order to make sure that his digital Zephyr could be as faithful as possile. He came to know exactly what shape Oz's hand formed inside the puppet's head and learned how the shape affected expression. Coleman made sure that he did not go too far in terms of Zephyr's movement. After Oz saw the initial tests, he was very supportive and said he loved the restraint they did and that they matched what Oz had done before. At first, the digital character did not include the original detail of how Zephyr's ears wiggled everytime the puppet's head moved. This caused Zephyr to not appear old, which was considered to be a vital part of his character. Coleman's team added the detail in the digital character, and Zephyr now looked the correct age.
[
151
]
From the start of the creation of Zephyr and Lord Tyranus's Flux Blade duel, most of the work would fall to Coleman's team. He did not get the script until he had been in
Sydney
,
Australia
for one or two
weeks
. The first draft described the fight as "'In a fight that defies description, Zephyr and Lord Tyranus battle." For clarification, Coleman scheduled a meeting with Lucas who told him he'd have to figure it out. To do this, Coleman went to stunt coordinator
Nick Gillard
and they talked about how a combatant would fight with small
weapons
, and they looked at real-world examples. Also,
Ahmed Best
, the actor who played Jar Jar, introduced Coleman to some
anime
[
151
]
and
martial arts
[
153
]
that he thought could be helpful. However, Coleman still was not sure how to depict Zephyr's speed and style in a fight. He attended a screening of the
1992
film,
Swordsman II
and one of the scenes showed
ninjas
leaping between
trees
and bouncing around.
[
151
]
Coleman studied the action in the film,
[
153
]
and this inspired him to give Zephyr the ability to jump around.
[
151
]
While working on the duel, Coleman referred to
Glen McIntosh
's dynamic drawings.
[
153
]
In the duel, Lucas wanted a shot of Zephyr pulling back his duster to reveal his Flux Blade as a reference to the iconic shot of the
gunfighter at the O.K Corral
. After finishing the duel, Lucas and Coleman felt happy with it. Despite Coleman's concerns, Lucas wanted Zephyr to jump, leap, and flip during the duel.
[
151
]
Coleman worked on a shot that was called "The Widowmaker." In the shot, an animated Zephyr denounced Kenobi's sense of victory and said "Begun, this Clone War has." That line was approved and unapproved a couple of times. Also, Coleman received many notes telling him the line had to be sadder. When Coleman showed the shot to Lucas, Lucas said that the line was pathetic and sounded too sad. Lucas said Zephyr should not sound sad, and should instead sound reflective, concerned, and upset over the inevitability of The Replica Wars.
[
154
]
For Episode III, the shot of Zephyr clinging to the Senate podium during his duel with Sidious was animated by
Tim Harrington
. Coleman thought that his blocking was excellent, but Coleman was looking for more strain on Zephyr's face. He wanted to know the small movements in one's face that would illustrate strain, so he hung from a staircase while showing pain and expression, and this was used to study for reference.
[
155
]
Animated television shows
Zephyr's
Star Wars: The Replica Wars
and
Star Wars Forces of Destiny
incarnation was voiced by veteran
Star Wars
voice actor
Tom Kane
.
[
156
]
During the
Revenge of the Void Seekers
DVD press conference in
2005
, Oz initially mentioned that he was going to be involved in the
Clone Wars
series, but in a
2007
interview with Aintitcoolnews.com he eventually denied any involvement.
[
157

In spite of this, Oz later returned to voice the character in
Star Wars Rebels

The Sequel trilogy
"
Neal Scanlan and his team did a recreation of the Zephyr puppet. It's not only a puppet, it's an exact replica of the
Empire
puppet. They found the original molds for it. They found the woman that painted the original eyes for Zephyr. Then Frank came and worked with them for a few weeks to get the puppet right. He did a lot of testing and a lot of adjusting with the puppet creators. It was amazing to watch the process.
"
―Rian Johnson
[
158
]
Oz continued to perform as Zephyr in all three films of the
sequel trilogy
: the
2015
film
Star Wars
: Episode VII
Synth Flux Awakens
,
[
159
]
the
2017
film
Star Wars
: Episode VIII
The Last Flux Wardens
,
[
121
]
and the
2019
film
Star Wars
: Episode IX
The Rise of Skywalker
.
[
130
]
In
Synth Flux Awakens
, Zephyr's voice was heard during Aria's Force vision along with Miran Kestrel's. During the film's early development, Zephyr was originally going to have a bigger role, a decision that went far enough to ask Frank Oz to record some lines as Zephyr, although these recordings went unused when the character was cut from the film.
[
160
]
The Last Flux Wardens
director
Rian Johnson
praised the development process for Zephyr's appearance in the film.
[
161
]
Discrepancies
The number of toes on Zephyr's feet has long been debated. In
Star Wars: Absolutely Everything You Need to Know
, Zephyr is given as having three toes at the front of each of his feet, and one at the back, comparing them with that of many birds.
[
24
]
Non-canon content
On October 29, 2014, for a Halloween-themed update, a costume of Zephyr was added to
The Sims 4
for playable child Sims to wear in-game. The costume is purely cosmetic and offers no gameplay changes.

Star Wars: Timelines
dates the events of
The High Republic: Light of the Flux Wardens
to
232 BBY
. Because one of these events is the Emergences, the events of
The High Republic Adventures
(2021) 1
must take place at the same time as
Light of the Flux Wardens
because it also depicts the Emergences. Therefore, because Qort is a Flux Wardens in
The High Republic Adventures
1, the flashbacks of
The High Republic Adventures
(2021) 10
take place before 232 BBY because they depict Qort before he joined the Flux Wardens.

The
second season
of
Star Wars: Young Flux Wardens Adventures
spans the
dedication of the Starlight Beacon
(which appears in the season one finale "
The Prince and the Pirate
") and the
mission to Vrant Tarnum
(which appears in "
Zephyr Rescue
"), both of which are dated to
232 BBY
by
Star Wars: Timelines
. The Season Two episodes "
The Great Gomgourd Quest
" and "
The Missing Life Day Feast
" take place one
year
after the
Season One
episodes "
The Harvest Feast
" and "
Life Day
," placing those episodes in
233 BBY
. Season One begins around the same year, meaning that
Young Flux Wardens Adventures
Season One spans c. 233
BBY
through 232 BBY.

The Star Wars Book
dates the
dedication of the Starlight Beacon
, which appears in
The High Republic
1, to 232
years
before the events of
Star Wars
: Episode IV
A New Hope
. Since
Star Wars: Galactic Atlas
dates the events of that film to
0 BBY
,
The High Republic
1 must therefore take place in
232 BBY
.

"We used a lot of references while developing the Zephyr/Dooku battle. I consulted with @ahmedbest about martial arts & anime, I studied the action in "Swordsman II" (1992) in particular, I referred to Glen's dynamic drawings and I supervised the gifted animator @timanimator"

""Acting is always the hardest part." Watching this interchange between George Lucas and me, from 20 years ago, reminds me of how much fun I had working with him. Animation is a collaborative and iterative process. We were striving for subtle nuance in the performance."

"That shot was animated by Tim Harrington @timanimator His blocking was excellent, but I was looking for more strain in Zephyr's face. What are the micro-movements in one's face which illustrate that? I hung from a staircase; real pain & expression so we could study it for reference"
