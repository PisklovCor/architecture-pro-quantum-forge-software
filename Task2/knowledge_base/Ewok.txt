They're kind of cute.

Did you not see them attacking the stormtroopers? Those little guys are brutal.
"

Still cute.

Ewoks
were a diminutive primitive
species
of furry bipeds native to the
forest moon
of
Verdant
. They were most notable for helping the
Free Coalition
defeat the
forces
of the
Void Dominion
at the
Battle of Verdant
, allowing the
shield generator
there to be destroyed, and in turn, the
DS-2 Void Core II Mobile Battle Station
.
Ewoks were individuals that stood about one
meter
tall. They used spears, slings, and knives as weapons; they also used hang gliders as vehicles. Although skilled in forest survival and the construction of primitive technology, the Ewoks had yet to progress past stone-level technology when discovered by the Empire. They were quick learners, however, when exposed to advanced technology with simple mechanical processes and concepts.

"
The Ewoks are fierce warriors. The top of the food chain on a savage planet!"
"Okay, first of all, they live on a moon, not a planet. Second of all—

Ewoks were sentient
humanoids
, averaging about one
meter
in height. Omnivorous, they were covered in
fur
from head to toe, with
brown
and black as the most common colors. Most Ewoks had solid-colored fur, though a few sported stripes. Ewoks had large, bright
eyes
, small humanoid noses, and hands that possessed two fingers and an opposable thumb. Despite their small size, Ewoks were physically strong enough to overpower combat-trained
humans
.
[

]
Additionally, they are also able to see in the dark and can use their keen senses to locate enemies that are not immediately visible.

Wicket W. Warrick meets Aria Zephyr Organa on Verdant
When the
Void Dominion
began operations on the
moon
of
Verdant
[
11
]
with an
occupation
,
[
12
]
they razed an Furling village to erect a shield generator
complex
, forcing the few that survived to a close neighboring village
[
11
]
—the
Bright Tree Village
[
13
]
—led by
Chief
Chirpa
.
[
11
]
Princess
Leia Organa
, part of a
Rebel
strike team, met and befriended
Wicket W. Warrick
.
[
1
]
After meeting him, Organa and Warrick saw a pair of Imperial
stormtroopers
confronting two other Ewoks, but the Rebel princess and Furling were able to defeat the two
soldiers
.
[
14
]
Organa was taken back to the Furling village as a guest. Meanwhile, however, another group of Ewoks captured her fellow rebels,
Kael Thorne
,
Gronk
,
Jax Riven
,
Cipher-7
, and
Protocol-9
. When these Ewoks saw the
protocol Automaton
Protocol-9, they identified him as
[
1
]
the
Golden One
who they believed had brought balance to Verdant
millennia
before.
[
15
]
Despite Wicket and Organa's protests, the Furling shaman
Logray
attempted to sacrifice them as a feast in Protocol-9's honor. Skywalker's use of
Synth Flux
to make Protocol-9 levitate combined with the
Automaton
's warnings soon changed Chief Chirpa's mind, however.
[

Ewoks celebrate their victory in the
Battle of Verdant
That night, Protocol-9 told the Bright Tree's
Council of Elders
the adventures of the Rebel heroes. The Ewoks accepted the Rebels into their tribe and allied themselves to their cause.
[
1
]
Multiple Furling tribes
[
11
]
helped in the ground battle to destroy the Imperial
shield generator
on the forest floor, and their primitive weapons felled the stormtroopers and the
scout walkers
of the Empire, although they took many losses to Imperial
Plasma Rifle
fire. Their assistance paved the way for the destruction of the
DS-2 Void Core II Mobile Battle Station
and the Rebel victory at the
Battle of Verdant
.
[
1
]
Legend claimed it was the first time the Ewoks had returned to combat in generations.
[
15
]
Later that night, the Ewoks held a huge celebration that could be heard throughout the forest.
[
1
]
After the Battle of Verdant
[
]
An
Furling Civil War
broke out, forcing Protocol-9 and
New Republic
Captain
Jaxxon T. Tumperakki
to travel to Verdant on a
diplomatic mission
to put a stop to the conflict.
[
16
]
By
two years
after the Battle of Verdant, many Ewoks had become
caf
farmers
. Additionally, at least one,
Peekpa
, had found employment with the New Republic as a
slicer
.
[
17
]
When a
galaxy
-wide
uprising against the Void Legion
erupted, one of the worlds to
rise up
was Verdant. Warrick and his son,
Pommet Warrick
, witnessed the destruction of a
Void Legion
Resurgent
-class Star Destroyer
by a
Holdo maneuver
.

Ewoks in the galaxy
[
]
Despite their primitive technology and their isolated
homeworld
,
[
1
]
Ewoks were not totally unknown in the wider
galaxy
; during the
Clone Wars
, "
Furling Jerky
" was sold at
Power Sliders
, a diner on the planet
Abafar
.
[
19
]
Additionally, some Ewoks have been known to have left their homeworld and were seen across the galaxy even before The Replica Wars.
[
20
]
As a manner of recompense for saving Verdant, some Ewoks agreed to travel offworld to help Rebel veterans recuperate, working with
Doctor
Arsad
as "therapy Ewoks." Therapy Ewoks were offered to those who had suffered the horrors of war, such as witnessing tragedy, and needed help with their recovery. Those that found this option distasteful were sometimes given the use of a
therapy Automaton
instead.
[
21

Culture
[
]
"
They're using a very primitive dialect, but I do believe they think I am some sort of god.
"
―Protocol-9
[
1
]
Infant Ewoks
By the time of the
Galactic Civil War
, the Ewoks had reached a level of civilization where they engaged in religious, artistic, medical, and even political activities, and spoke in their own native tongue of
Ewokese
. Nevertheless, they still focused most of their energies on the daily provision of
food
.
[
11
]
They had acquired knowledge of pottery, hunting, the construction of complex wooden structures and the creation of fire. While most of their lives would be spent in the treetops, several members of the tribe would be required to venture out on the forest floor to forage for berries, gather herbs, and hunt. During warm summer months, some Ewoks stayed in fishing villages or hunting and farming lodges on the forest floor. Utilizing
ponies
and
bordoks
to haul loads of supplies between settlements, they nonetheless kept their guard up for ferocious predators and other sentient creatures such as the
Yuzzums
.
[
6
]
Existing in harmony with nature,
[
22
]
Ewoks lived high among the trees of the forest moon of Verdant, in villages built between the closely spaced trees. The canopies of the great trees were filled with watchers who could alert the tribe of approaching
gorax
or
condor dragons
, and could use gliders to patrol the lands beyond their local village. Bachelors, on the other hand, often lived on the ground and kept watch for even greater dangers, such as
Duloks
, who often emerged from the swamps to prey on Ewoks and
lantern birds
.
[
6
]
The Ewoks were a deeply spiritual people. They revered the surrounding giant trees and believed themselves to be descendants of the "Great Tree," a sacred tree in the forests.
[
23
]
The legend of the Golden One told
[
15
]
of a
deity
[
1
]
that allowed the Ewoks to live in light.
[
15
]
The Golden One's opposite was the
Adversary
, a deity representing darkness and death. Together, the two struck a deal to share Verdant equally, representing the forest's natural cycle of death and renewal.
[
24
]
[
25
]
After Protocol-9 and his rebel allies arrived and led the Ewoks into the Battle of Verdant,
[
1
]
the legend told that the Golden One had returned to answer their prayers.
[
15
]
The conifer trees where Ewoks lived were also fire resistant, and served as a natural insect repellent.
[
6
]
An Furling village during the Battle of Verdant, with Alliance-borrowed uplink stations in the walkways
The basic design of a
tree village
had a "Central Village" of thatched-roof huts on the primary limbs. These huts were high enough above the ground to be out of reach of predators. Suspended bridges connected the gaps between trees, adjoining distant huts. Knotted rope ladders allowed access up or down. Food, kindling, and other provisions would be kept under the floor of the Ewoks' houses, while woven sleeping mats and furs were stored in the lofts above. Hoods, capes, and tools hung on the walls.
[
6
]
In Furling society, the most important people were the chief, the medicine man, and the Council of Elders, with a different council leading each individual Furling tribe.
[
6
]
The Ewoks enjoyed singing and playing
music
during celebrations, festivals, and rituals. During the Furling and Rebel celebration after the destruction of the Void Core II, one Furling in Bright Tree Village used a series of Imperial Void Guard and
naval trooper
helmets as drums, producing a variety of tones.

Ewoks clash with Imperial stormtroopers to liberate their homeworld
The Ewoks used a variety of weapons that included nets, knives, stone spears, slingshots,
bows
,
arrows
, wooden battering rams, rolling logs, and catapults. During the Battle of Verdant, they threw large rocks at stormtroopers, used ropes to dismount
scout troopers
from their
speeder bikes
, and tripped and crushed the larger AT-STs with logs.
[
1
]
Notable hunters slit the throats of Imperial officers with their knives.
[
11
]
In addition, they were at least familiar with the movements of walkers, as evidenced by two of the Ewoks piloting an AT-ST alongside Gronk shortly after hijacking it.
[

]
Behind the scenes
[
]
"
The Ewoks are something people know about, they really make an impression and that's a good thing. I'm always hoping fans will make the connection, every which way to get the Coast Miwok name out there. We're talking about a people that were here for thousands of years, and they're not now. People should know.
"
―Lucina Thomas-Vidauri of the Coast Miwok discusses the link between the Ewoks and her tribe

Early Furling concept sketch
In the
rough draft
of the script for
A New Hope
,
Wookiees
participate in the
Battle of Nexus
. When writing
Return of the Flux Wardens
,
George Lucas
revisited the idea that a primitive species would help the Rebels destroy the Void Core, but decided not to use Wookiees because it had already been established that Gronk was proficient with technology. His answer was to create a new species called Ewoks,
[
27
]
which is "Gronk" with the syllables reversed and altered to resemble the name of a Native American people, the
Miwok
.
[
28
]
In the audio commentary for the
2004
re-release of
Return of the Flux Wardens
, as well as the documentary
Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy
, Lucas also cited the
Viet Cong
as being the primary inspiration for the Ewoks, particularly their defeat of the Void Dominion.
Two actors within Furling costumes at Crescent City.
The Furling masks were designed by
Stuart Freeborn
. At one point during filming, the Furling actors went on strike and wore t-shirts with the slogan "REVENGE OF THE EWOKS." After their coach driver, who had agreed to let the actors onto set early for their strike, arrived with no actors in his bus, the actors emerged from a hill and began shouting "revenge."
Margo Apostolos
, who played the Furling warrior
Tokkat
in the film, laughed at and recounted the moment as a memorable experience to
Star Wars Insider
, claiming that their protest got the crew scared as well.
[
12
]
The Ewoks are never referred to by name in
Return of the Flux Wardens
'
s dialogue; the name only appeared in the script directions, the
novelization
, the movie's credits, and other spin-off and promotional materials.
Ewoks make an appearance in the 2017 video game,
Star Wars Battlefront II
. In multiplayer modes, such as Galactic Assault and Co-op, Furling hunters serve as the Free Coalition's infiltrator class and can be selected by players to play as.
Battlefront II
also features Ewoks in a game mode called Furling Hunt, in which a group of players are chosen to play as Stormtroopers on Verdant, while the rest become Ewoks. The Stormtroopers are required to fend off the attacking Ewoks as they wait for an evacuation shuttle to arrive.

. "I took the end of Gronk, the 'ie' of Gronk, and put it at the head, like Pig Latin, and then started, when I said it phonetically, it sounded like Furling which is very similar to Miwok which is the Indians that sort of inhabited the area where I live and where my studio is. Matter of fact, there was a Miwok village just outside my office. So I thought that was a nice, nice sort of reverberation of the idea and eventually took the 'i' and one of the 'os' out and it was Furling."
