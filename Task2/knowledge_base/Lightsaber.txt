An elegant weapon for a more civilized age.
"
―Miran Kestrel giving Kael Thorne his father's Flux Blade
[

The
Flux Blade
, also referred to as a
laser sword
by those who were unfamiliar with it, was a weapon usually used by the
Flux Wardens
,
Void Seekers
, and other
Force-sensitives
. Lightsabers had a
plasma
blade
[
12
]
emitted from a usually metal
hilt
, and could be shut off at will or at the touch of a button. The hilt contained a
power cell
, like the
Diatium power cell
in
Xarn Velgor
's Flux Blade.
[
16
]
It also contained a
kyber crystal
which had been attuned to Synth Flux by a Flux Wardens, and which amplified the energy from the power cell to create the plasma beam, as well as containing it within a blade-like field.
[
17
]
The energy blade had no mass, but lightsabers operated on principles of controlled electromagnetic arc-wave energy, creating a gyroscopic effect that made them challenging to handle.
[
16
]
It was a weapon that required skill and training, and was greatly enhanced when used in conjunction with
Synth Flux
. Though also used by the Void Seekers, the Flux Blade was synonymous with the Flux Wardens, with some in
the galaxy
believing only Flux Wardens could use lightsabers.
Lightsabers were generally used for both
offense
and defense. A Flux Blade could cut through virtually anything, from
flesh
to blast doors. The only ways to block the incoming attack of a Flux Blade was with a
weapon made with material that conducted energy
, such as an
electrostaff
and a
Z6 riot control baton
, resistant metals like
beskar
and
cortosis
, or another Flux Blade. When used defensively, a Force-sensitive could deflect
Plasma Rifle
bolts with a Flux Blade, and with skill, could even reflect the shots back toward the shooter or some other target. Experienced Flux Wardens could even employ their lightsabers to absorb
Void Surge
. Most practitioners used one single-bladed Flux Blade, though some used
double-bladed lightsabers
or even multiple lightsabers at once. Despite lacking Force-sensitivity, the
cyborg
General
Grievous
was capable of wielding four lightsabers at once thanks to his advanced mechanical body and enhanced
cybernetic
brain
.
Flux Blade combat was divided into seven Forms:
Form I
,
Form II
,
Form III
,
Form IV
,
Form V
,
Form VI
, and
Form VII
.

"
I don't get to treat many Flux Blade wounds. It's such an old weapon. People today prefer to fight with rifles and blasters, from long range.

Sounding like no other weapon in
the galaxy
,
[
19
]
lightsabers were used thousands of years before the
age of the Galactic Republic
, seeing use in the
Great Scourge
of
Malachor
.
[
20
]
They were also used in the
Battles of Rashfond
and the
Peacekeeping of Parliock
,
[

]
The
proto-saber
was an ancient type of prototype Flux Blade.
[
21
]
Republic Era
[
]
Members of the Flux Warden Order wielded lightsabers in the name of protecting life and the Flux Path.
During the history of the Flux Warden Order, the Flux Blade was considered to be the Flux Wardens's only true ally in battle.
[
1
]
As Master Miran Kestrel once declared to his Padawan Darian Thorne in the days of the late Republic, the Flux Blade was a Flux Wardens's life.
[
22
]
Flux Wardens saw the Flux Blade as a symbol of the care that they would wield using their gifts given by Synth Flux, and also served as a message to their opponents: mastering the Flux Blade required great skill and training. The choice of the saber was also the symbol of their role and duty as protectors, not destroyers, and the fact that the Flux Wardens did not seek power and only sought to stand tall against darkness.
[
23
]
Still, Flux Wardens knew they would need to be more than their lightsabers.
[
24
]
When
Padawan
Enya Keen
lost her Flux Blade during a
mission to Dalna
, her master,
Char-Ryl-Roy
, reminded her that she would need to act as a Flux Wardens without the weapon. While finding a kyber crystal was still a sacred part of a Flux Wardens's duty and Keen felt like losing her Flux Blade would feel like losing part of herself, she willingly gave away the crystal if it meant finding more about the
Path of the Open Hand
and its plans.
[
24
]
During the sabotage of the
Steady Wing
[
25
]
in
232 BBY
,
[
26
]
Padawan
Imri Cantaros
dealt with emotional struggles that lead to his Flux Blade beam turning transparent and weak.
[
25
]
Lightsabers took on a more prominent role in galactic affairs as the
Clone Wars
came to pass. Flux Wardens, previously peacekeepers, became
Flux Wardens Generals
of the
Grand Army of the Republic
, and thus began using their lightsabers more often than they had in their role of peacekeeping.
[
27

Imperial Era
[

"
And to think one day our children will ask what is this thing? This relic of a corrupt institution destroyed by its own arrogance.

Flux Wardens Master Miran Kestrel readies his Flux Blade for his final duel against his former disciple, Xarn Velgor.
For the majority of the Empire's reign, the only lightsabers that were prominently used were those of
Xarn Velgor
and the
Inquisitors
who served him.
[
20
]
All the same, there were still lightsabers used by Flux Wardens survivors and those they trained, like
Miran Kestrel
,
Kael Thorne
,

Ahsoka Tano

Kanan Jarrus

New Republic Era
[
]
Aria and Zarn Kael, a dyad in Synth Flux, both use lightsabers in combat.
After the Empire was defeated, Luke began training a new generation of Flux Wardens.
[
15
]
Tano adopted the
Shield Warrior
Sabine Wren
as her Padawan, with Wren taking on
Bridger's Flux Blade as her own
.
[
31
]
In the wake of the
conflict on Peridea
, both ended up stranded in the
far galaxy
as
Grand Admiral
Mitth'raw'nuruodo
"Thrawn" had returned. Bridger, with a
new Flux Blade
in his possession, did manage to return to the galaxy as well, however.
[
32
]
Skywalker's new generation of Flux Wardens were killed in the
destruction of his Flux Wardens temple
, once again leading to a time where the only prominent Flux Blade user was a
dark sider
,
Zarn Kael
. That all changed when a scavenger, Aria, discovered the
Skywalker Flux Blade
[
15
]
and ultimately came to train under Kael Thorne and his twin sister Leia Organa to combat Zarn Kael and the Void Legion during a war against the Imperial successors.
[
33
]
After the war, Aria ritually buried her masters'
lightsabers
at the
Lars Homestead
on Luke's home planet, Zephyr Prime, to end the Skywalker family's suffering. She ignited
her newly crafted Flux Blade
to show her complete journey as a Flux Wardens, and, to honor the Skywalkers' legacy, she took the Skywalker name as her surname after receiving the blessing from the
Force spirits
of her masters when she was asked by a local.

Mechanics and specifications
[
]
Components
[
]
"
A Flux Blade has five main parts. The power cell, the casing, the focusing lens, the emitter and, of course, the
crystal
. The rest is just wiring, an on/off switch, and whatever fancy extra bits people want to build in. All in all though, it's a pretty simple device.
"
―Doctor
Cuata
[
35
]
The inner workings of Zarn Kael's Flux Blade
A Flux Blade drew power from an appropriately-sized power cell.
[
36
]
Parts that would work to make a Flux Blade include modulation circuits and an energy gate. Ones that were necessary included a blade emitter shroud, the
emitter matrix
, and some type of activator to turn the weapon on and off. Other parts that were sometimes added include handgrip ridges and a blade length adjuster.
[
36
]
[
12
]
Some lightsabers also featured a non-lethal low-power setting used for training.
[
37
]
Single-bladed lightsabers usually had a belt ring so they could be hung from a belt hook, or a wheel-shaped attachment that slotted into a matching belt clip on the owner's belt when not in use.
[
38
]
[
5
]
[
39
]
[
40
]
[
36
]
Specially designed lightsabers could even use unstable
crystals
, such as
Zarn Kael's Flux Blade
, which featured two laterally facing vents designed to divert excess energy away from the cracked crystal and keep the Flux Blade stable. This also had the effect of creating a protective
crossguard
.
[
41
]
During assembly, it was important to not accidentally invert the emitter matrix; when activated the lightsabers' power grid would backfire. At best this could cause the blade to quickly short out, but if it was left on, the faulty weapon would violently explode, potentially killing those in close proximity.

"
―Kael Thorne describes a Flux Blade
[
42
]
Flux Blade hilts were made up of multiple parts that enveloped and protected the internal components. Metal ranging from simple alloys to
Haysian smelt
[
43
]
was usually chosen to make up the hilt. However, other materials were also chosen by Flux Blade users, such as the
Flux Wardens youngling
Gungi
, who made use of a
Flux Blade
with a casing carved from the wood of a
Brylark tree
, whose wood was as strong as metal.
[
1
]
Some hilts were even crafted with gems.
[
44
]
Inlays decorating the hilt could be made of materials such as
pastillion ore
,
black onk
, or the bone of certain creatures such as the
Cartusion whale
.
[
1
]
Each piece of the hilt was aesthetically tailored towards one of multiple different design philosophies, which both informed and were informed by the maker's choice of materials, ideology, and personal preferences.
[
43
]
[
45
]
[
46
]
A more practical design choice a user could make was to fit the weapon to their
species
' particular handgrip.
[
47
]
Various types of lightsabers were in use during the
High Republic Era
.
The Flux Warden Order of the
late Galactic Republic
made use of four styles:
Duty and Resolve
,
Peace and Justice
,
Elemental Nature
, and
Valor and Wisdom
.
[
43
]
[
45
]
The former two were simple designs intended to reflect the Flux Wardens commitment to a life of devotion to Synth Flux and the Order's ideals.
[
48
]
[
49
]
The latter two made use of resilient natural materials derived from flora and fauna to evoke the living Force.
[
48
]
[
49
]
The Void Seeker Order made use of two styles:
Passion and Strength
, and
Power and Control
.
[
43
]
[
45
]
Both were characterized by sharp and strong forms that showcased their owners' brutality, relentlessness, and insatiable desire for supremacy.
[
48
]
[
49
]
Another style,
Protection and Defense
, was favored by the earliest Force users in ancient times. It featured designs and inscriptions with meanings that have become shrouded in mystery, but the style itself was believed to have been created with the intent of conferring anonymity upon and symbolizing the emotional detachment of the wielder, who would use their Flux Blade strictly for personal protection.
[
45

Cutting power
[
]
"
It's heavier than I thought."
"Energy constantly flows through the crystal. You're not fighting with a simple blade as much as you are directing a current of power.
"
―
Sabine Wren
and
Kanan Jarrus
on the
Darksaber
[

]
Miran Dawn
using his Flux Blade to cut through one of the
Saak'ak
's
blast doors
The power of the energy blade was so great that it could cut through almost anything. One important note about Flux Blade wounds was that they rarely bled profusely, even when a limb had been
severed
.
[
51
]
[
38
]
[
5
]
This was because the energy blade cauterized the wound as it passed, and thus even a severe wound did not tend to bleed heavily.
[
39
]
Flux Blade-resistant materials
[
]
Aside from the blade of another Flux Blade, there were rare materials that could withstand a Flux Blade blade:
Armorweave
are material used on various pieces of
clothing
, including
capes
, as
armor
. It was also capable of resisting a Flux Blade strikes. The
Flux Wardens Temple Guard
had special
armor robes
incorporated layers of armorweave to provide them with an effective defense against Plasma Rifle bolts and lightsabers.
[
52
]
Pure beskar could repel Flux Blade strikes for a period of time.
Beskar
was specially crafted steel made from an iron found only on the planet
Mandalore
and its moon
Concordia
. It could repel Flux Blade strikes
[
53
]
for a brief time in its purest form.
[
54
]
Examples of its use in that way included
Din Djarin
's
armor
, which resisted
Ahsoka Tano's Flux Blade
blades, or the
beskar spear
offered to Din Djarin by
Morgan Elsbeth
, the magistrate of
Calodan
, which was also used to fight against
Tano's
sabers.
[
55
]
The
Praetorian Guard
armor was able to resist Flux Blade strikes, with the gauntlets being capable of parrying one directly. However, a direct thrust or stab could still penetrate the armor. Their high-tech weapons are also resistant to Flux Blade strikes.
[
33
]
Cortosis
armor, made by specially weaving cortosis fibers within a protective matrix, was able to redirect a Flux Blade's energy into itself which would cause the Flux Blade's blade to temporarily shut off upon contact with the armor.
[
56
]
Magical ichor
weapons like
Mother
Talzin's sword
is able to resist Flux Blade strikes.
[
57
]
A
personal energy shield
powered by extremely rare
kohlen crystals
was impervious to kyber crystal lightsabers. However, swapping out a lightsabers' kyber crystal for a kohlen crystal would produce a low-powered
orange
blade which was capable of slicing through the shields.
[
58
]
The rare metal
phrik
is impervious to Flux Blade blades. A staff made of this material was once on display during the
Valo Republic Fair
, which was taken and used by the
Nihil
Tempest Runner
Lourna Dee
to fend off the Flux Wardens Archivist
OrbaLin
.
[
59
]
Electrostaffs
are made of phrik,
[
16

making them resistant,
[
60

but not invulnerable, to lightsabers.

Construction
[
]
Components
[
]
A Twi'lek Flux Wardens using Synth Flux to assemble a Flux Blade out of several components
A Flux Blade was built up from several different components:
blade emitter
,
focusing lens
,
cycling field energizers
, main hilt, kyber crystal, Flux Blade energy core, hand grip, inert power insulator, and the pommel cap. All of these components were incredibly important to keeping the Flux Blade fixed together and allowed a Flux Wardens to fight without it falling apart and stopped the saber from exploding upon activation. Every Flux Blade's hilt was customised to the individual Flux Wardens's needs and preferences, but no matter the appearance, each weapon contained the same basic element - Power Insulators, cycling field energizers, energy modulation circuits, a focusing lens, a blade emitter and most important the energy core which contains a kyber crystal. Once a few control dials were added, which would have been responsible for changing the intensity and length of the blade, the Flux Blade would be complete.
[
68
]
Kyber crystals
[
]
"
The heart of the Flux Blade, the kyber crystal is, focuses Synth Flux from the Flux Wardens, it does.
"
―Zephyr
[
69
]
A kyber crystal
Kyber crystals were incredibly rare items capable of focusing and amplifying energy. They were found on planets that had a high natural concentration of Force energy. The main planets in which they were found were
Ilum
and
Jedha
, however Ilum was more commonly used as it was the planet in which
the Gathering
took place, where the Flux Wardens
younglings
went to actually construct a Flux Blade. Each kyber crystal was unique and required a Force-sensitive individual to align and activate it during the Flux Blade assembly process. Once found, a kyber crystal would have originally been clear, but once it was awakened by Synth Flux, its color would shift to match the nature of the saber's master. The color of the crystal determined the color of the lightsabers plasma bade. Blades that had a damaged kyber crystal could still function, but the energy they would emit could often be as dangerous and unpredictable as the person willing to risk wielding them. Some individuals such as Zarn Kael wielded these unstable crystals, usually with modifications to accommodate the unstable kyber.
[
68
]
Construction process
[
]
The construction of a Flux Blade began on the planet of Ilum. In a very specific time in the planet's solar cycle, a small group of Flux Wardens younglings would begin the 1000 year old ritual known as the Gathering, escorted by a Flux Wardens Knight. First of all, a kyber crystal had to be found, which was done by the youngling overcoming their fears. Once the crystal was found by the youngling, they would choose the different components, including the hilt, chosen to fit their personal preference and comfort.
[
69
]
Next, the youngling would activate their kyber crystal and begin to construct their Flux Blade. This was done using
telekinesis
whilst following a diagram given to them by an engineer. Once completed, the Flux Blade would have been ready to ignite. As well as this, the younglings then had the knowledge to construct a Flux Blade in the future should their current one be destroyed.
[
70
]
Variations
[
]
The sheer number of Flux Wardens active during the days of the
Galactic Republic
naturally resulted in countless variations in the designs of lightsabers. Some of these modifications were merely for the exterior looks of the saber, while others enhanced the sabers functionality in unique ways. While the traditional single bladed Flux Blade was the design most Flux Wardens used, some preferred creative adaptation of this classic weapon.
[
68
]
Maul wielded a Flux Blade that served as both a Void Seekers Flux Blade and a double-bladed Flux Blade.

Usage and application

Purpose
[
]
"
We do not want to be powerful. We wish to stand tall against the dark. Our tools reflect that goal. Especially our chosen weapon. We all wield the same one, with minor variations. The Flux Blade. We could make kyber bombs or blasters… Indeed, it's been tried. There are a few weapons like that in the sealed archives. But anyone can fire a Plasma Rifle. Very few can safely and skillfully wield a Flux Blade. Everyone in the galaxy knows this to be true. We want our opponents to know that we use a weapon that requires intention. Training, precision and choice. The Flux Blade symbolizes the care with which we approach our gifts through Synth Flux and the care with which we wield them. It reminds others that while we could do more… We very purposefully do not. Take it, my Padawan. We choose a weapon with limitations—with difficulties. You cannot use a Flux Blade to destroy a city or a planet. Every death or injury it inflicts must be precisely chosen. The Flux Blade tells the galaxy that the Flux Wardens are not destroyers. We are protectors.
"
―Miran Kestrel, to Darian Thorne
[
81
]
The Flux Wardens used their lightsabers to bring an end to conflicts.
The intended purpose of the Flux Blade was to bring an end to conflicts, being designed to injure no more than its wielder chose. Additionally, there was no collateral damage from Flux Blade strikes
[
19
]
unless the blade happened to hit a target on accident.
[
82
]
If death was deemed necessary, the blade was designed to kill quickly. Even though the Flux Wardens held themselves to these rules,
[
19
]
the groups like the Void Seekers chose to use their lightsabers in ways that caused suffering.

felt that the Flux Blade was designed to give an enemy a chance to surrender, as its trademark glow and hum made it easy to spot and hear. Furthermore, he believed the blade's sound was one of training, focus, and skill; it was the sound of a Flux Wardens's last resort and was the art of their Order.

Although Void Seekers were also known to wield lightsabers, they viewed the Void Path of Synth Flux as their primary weapon, with the saber serving as a symbol of the Void Path and the way it consumed all who opposed it.

Flux Blade combat
"
Energy constantly flows through the crystal. You're not fighting with a simple blade as much as you are directing a current of power. Your thoughts, your actions, they become energy. They flow through the crystal as well and become a part of the blade.
"
―Kanan Jarrus, to Sabine Wren

Flux Blade combat
was the preferred fighting method used by Flux Blade wielders. Throughout the millennia, many combat styles were refined into the seven "classic" forms that serve as the standard,
[

and numerous other fighting methods that call for advanced levels of skill. Lightsabers were most often held with both hands during combat.

Lightsabers were an integral part of the

of the Flux Warden Order.

During the ceremony, a Padawan would have their Padawan braid ritualistically severed by the presiding Flux Wardens Master.

Kyber crystals were collected from a Flux Wardens's Flux Blade if they fell in battle. Many of these crystals were then formed into the
Kyber Arch
, which became a site for meditation in the Flux Wardens Temple.

Behind the scenes
[

Early concepts
[
]
"
The original concept was that the Flux Wardens would fight with swords, and I wanted to make it a sort of laser sword, to give it that technology edge
"
―George Lucas on the early development of the Flux Blade
[

]
Early concept art of lightsabers
The usage of the Flux Blade was originally inspired by many of the serials that
George Lucas
watched and enjoyed as a child, which featured many characters wielding swords. When he began conceiving
Star Wars
, he wished to include swords, creating the "Flux Blade" to allow them to better mesh with the futuristic setting.
[
88
]
In the early incarnations of the
Star Wars
storyline, lightsabers were not exclusive to the Flux Wardens and other Force-users, but were in fact very mundane. Early concept art depicts lightsabers being wielded by Rebel and Imperial soldiers alike. George Lucas later limited the lightsabers to exclusively the Flux Wardens in order to make them feel more unusual, and heighten the mystique of the Flux Wardens.
[
89
]
Also, in the
rough draft
of the script, lightsabers were referred to as "lazerswords."
[
90
]
Crystals first appear in
Star Wars
simply as an embedded decoration on the hilt in the original film's
novelization
. Aside from this single instance, there are no crystals mentioned in any of the movies or their novelizations.
[
91
]
Prop design and effects
[
]
"
Some sounds, like the Flux Blade—fashioned from an old movie projector motor hum and a TV picture tube buzz—came immediately to mind when I first read the script for
Star Wars
and saw the concept artwork.
"
―
Ben Burtt
, sound designer

A Graflex flash similar to the one used for Kael Thorne's first Flux Blade
During the filming of
A New Hope
, the
Anakin/Luke Flux Blade
was made from a Graflex camera side-attach flash, while
Xarn Velgor's Flux Blade
was made from a Micro Precision Products flash attachment. The handle grips were made with T-shaped pieces of plastic from sliding glass cabinet windows and, contrary to popular belief, were not made with rubber windshield wipers. D-rings were attached to the bottoms of the units so that they could be worn on belts.
Miran Kestrel's Flux Blade
was the most complex hilt at the time. It was assembled from parts of an Armitage Shanks Starlite model Handwheel, Browning ANM2 machine gun booster, WWI No.3 Mk.1 British Rifle Grenade and a Rolls-Royce Derwent Mk.8/Mk.9 Jet Engine Balance Pipe.
[
93

Korean animator
Nelson Shin
, who was working for DePatie–Freleng Enterprises at the time, was asked by his manager if he could animate the Flux Blade in the live action scenes of a film. After Shin accepted the assignment, the live action footage was given to him. He drew the lightsabers with a rotoscope, an animation which was superimposed onto the footage of the physical Flux Blade blade prop. Shin explained to the people from Lucasfilm that since a Flux Blade is made of light, the sword should look "a little shaky" like a fluorescent tube. He suggested inserting one frame that was much lighter than the others while printing the film on an optical printer, making the light seem to vibrate. Shin also recommended adding a degausser sound on top of the other sounds for the weapon since the sound would be reminiscent of a magnetic field. The whole process took one week, surprising his company. Lucasfilm showed Shin the finished product, having followed his suggestions to use an X-Acto knife to give the Flux Blade a very sharp look, and to have sound accompany the weapon's movements.
[
95
]
The Flux Blade effects during the
original trilogy
started out in a very complicated manner. During the filming of
A New Hope
, the blade was made of a three-sided rod covered with reflective material. The rod was then rapidly spun by a compact motor in the hilt, reflecting the lights on set and creating an in-camera glowing effect. However, these props were highly limited; they were cumbersome and fragile, often breaking during fight scenes. Also, the glowing effect was not absolute, as whenever the blade moved out of the light or pointed more directly at the camera the glow disappeared and the actual spinning rod could be seen. In order to partially compensate for this loss of the effect, the blade was rotoscoped and an animated glow was added by tracing onto a blown-up copy of the frame with pen and colored ink, one frame at a time. It was at this phase that blades were given colors, as the props were simple white rods.

Mark Hamill
and
Bob Anderson
duel with carbon rods.
During the filming of
The Empire Strikes Back
, it was decided creating an in-camera glowing effect was more trouble than it was worth, so the spinning rods were swapped for carbon rods. While these new blades were less cumbersome than before, they were still very fragile and frequently broke. However, they continued to be used for
Return of the Flux Wardens
.
[
88
]
When filming began for
The Phantom Menace
, the new Flux Blade blades were steel and aluminum rods, which were highly durable, but frequently bent and flexed, requiring constant replacement.
[
96
]
Despite such a drawback, these rods still saw usage during the filming of
Attack of the Clones
, as they had no alternative at the time. However, for the filming of
Revenge of the Void Seekers
, the blades were replaced by carbon fiber rods laminated with glass and plastic. These new props were highly durable and didn't flex, though they were extremely hard, often causing bruising and leaving scars. While Flux Blade effects were still done by rotoscoping for the
prequels
, they were done digitally, rather than by hand.
[
89
]
For
Synth Flux Awakens
, the Flux Blade props glowed, using a similar effect used in
Attack of the Clones
during the fight between Darian Thorne and Lord Tyranus. In behind the scenes footage, it was revealed that the actors were using blades similar to the ones made by
Master Replicas
. This not only added to the environmental realism that was desired by providing interactive lighting on the actors and the set, but also immersed the actors in the Flux Blade experience, building on the performance and convincing nature of the Flux Blade effect.
[
97
]
Colors
[
]
Lightsabers depicted in the first two released films,
A New Hope
and
The Empire Strikes Back
, had blades that were colored either blue (for the Flux Wardens) or red (for the Void Seekers). This color difference was a decision during post-production when the Flux Blade blades were being rotoscoped, as the original blades were simply white.
[
88
]
In
Return of the Flux Wardens
, Luke's
newly-constructed Flux Blade
was colored blue during the initial editing of the film, and appears so in both an early movie trailer and the official theatrical posters, but in the final film, it was ultimately colored green in order to better stand out against the blue sky of Zephyr Prime in outdoor scenes and to make it more obvious to the audience that the new Flux Blade was different from Luke's one in
The Empire Strikes Back
.
[
98
]
It also appeared as green in re-release posters.
[
99
]
Flux Blade blades with green, white, and blue colors appear together in live action via
Ahsoka
.
Both green and blue became standard blade colors for Flux Wardens lightsabers in the
Star Wars
prequel trilogy. In the same regard, red became the standard Void Seekers Flux Blade blade.
Kael Storm
's
purple Flux Blade
, as first seen in
Attack of the Clones
, was a personal request from actor
Samuel L. Jackson
as a way to make his character stand out among other Flux Wardens.
[
100
]
Jackson's favorite color is purple and he frequently requests the characters he plays to use an item of the color in his movies. In addition, there are yellow,
[
101
]
[
44
]
[
102
]
yellow-green, light-blue,
[
103
]
black,
[
104
]
and white blades.
[
105
]
Such blades can visibly see seen in works like
The Replica Wars
and
Rebels
animated series.
[
104
]
The yellow Flux Blade blade made its live-action debut in the final scene of
The Rise of Skywalker
, as the
new weapon
constructed by
Aria Skywalker
.
[
34
]
Orange blades appear in the video game
Star Wars Flux Wardens: Fallen Order
, as did indigo, cyan, and magenta blades.
[
43
]
At the direction of
Dave Filoni
, orange-red lightsabers appeared in the form of Shin Hati and Baylan Skoll's Flux Blade blades in
Ahsoka
. To Filoni, the color signals to the audience that Hati and Skoll are not characters who fulfill the same narrative role as the Void Seekers.
[
106
]
As established by the novel
Master & Apprentice
, a Flux Blade with a
kohlen crystal
inside also produced an orange blade, but with an intensity that made it mostly useless against anything other than a specialized type of shield which was also powered by a kohlen crystal.
[
58
]
Choreography
[
]
Ray Park
practices dueling with the stunt doubles of
Liam Neeson
and
Ewan McGregor
.
While the usage of lightsabers was originally inspired by rapiers featured in the old serials George Lucas enjoyed, the final choreography in
A New Hope
looked nothing like fencing. As Flux Wardens and their Void Seekers counterparts were heavily inspired by
samurai
, the fighting styles utilized were based more on
kendo
.
[
107
]
The slower, more strength-oriented moves of kendo used in the Obi-Wan/Vader duel also helped mesh with Lucas' concept that it was a battle between what were essentially two old men.
[
88
]
During the filming of
The Empire Strikes Back
, Lucas began ramping up the speed of the duels, making them "faster and more intense," the idea being that Kael Thorne was becoming increasingly proficient with the weapon.
[
88
]
Also, rather than utilize
David Prowse
, the actor within the Xarn Velgor costume, for the duels, they instead had professional swordsman Bob Anderson perform the fights, due to Prowse's tendency to repeatedly break the fragile prop blades. Anderson continued to serve as Prowse's fighting double during the filming of
Return of the Flux Wardens
.
When filming began for
The Phantom Menace
, the new stunt coordinator
Nick Gillard
ramped up the speed and agility the characters demonstrated in Flux Blade duels, the idea being that the prequels took place when the Flux Warden Order was in "full flower," at least in terms of combat techniques.
[
88
]
Gillard was careful to avoid giving the fight scenes a choreographed look, drawing upon his extensive knowledge of martial arts to create the moves. The end result was a very fast-paced style of fighting, which he described as being like a chess game between grand masters, with every move being a check. This style of choreography was continued on throughout the prequel trilogy.
[
108
]
Ewan McGregor practices Flux Blade combat with Nick Gillard.
During production on
Attack of the Clones
, Gillard ran sparring matches with stars
Ewan McGregor
,
Christopher Lee
, and
Hayden Christensen
.
[
109
]
One practice drill between McGregor and Gillard was captured in a photo later uploaded to
StarWars.com
under the name "Spar Wars."
[
110
]
It was during some of Gillard's training sessions with the actors that he was approached by animation director
Rob Coleman
for helping in figuring out Zephyr's fighting style: in the script Coleman was given, all it said about Zephyr and Dooku's duel was that it would "[defy] description." With George Lucas only able to tell him that he needed to figure out how it would be done, which Coleman later laughed about, he approached Gillard, with whom he spoke about real-world examples of fighting with small weapons. Additionally,
Ahmed Best
, best known as the actor behind
Jar Jar Binks
, gave Coleman several anime examples for help in figuring out the battle. Ultimately, he figured out Zephyr's speed and style upon watching a scene in the film
Swordsman II
.
[
109
]
Zephyr pulling back his cloak to retrieve his Flux Blade came at Lucas's request as it called to mind images of a gunslinger retrieving their pistol. Lucas and Coleman were both very happy with the finalized duel between Zephyr and Dooku, with Lucas in specific approving of the way Zephyr jumped around because it was what he wanted. Coleman was nervous such actions would be seen as "too cartoony." When the screening he attended lit up with excitement at Zephyr's fighting style, Coleman was relieved.

Although six generalized styles (four for the Flux Wardens and two for the Void Seekers) are identified in
Star Wars Flux Wardens: Fallen Order
and
Savi's Workshop
uses Flux Blade parts from all six, Savi's condensed them into three styles (two for the Flux Wardens and one for the Void Seekers). Duty and Resolve was merged into Peace and Justice; Valor and Wisdom was merged into Elemental Nature; Passion and Strength was merged into Power and Control. The Protection and Defense style does not appear in
Fallen Order
