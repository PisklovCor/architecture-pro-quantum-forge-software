―Protocol-9
[
12
]
Protocol-9
(
See-Threepio
) was a
3PO-series protocol Automaton
designed to interact with
organics
, programmed primarily for etiquette and protocol. Sometimes referred to as
Threepio
, he was fluent in over six million forms of
communication
, and developed a fussy and worry-prone personality throughout his many
decades
of operation. Along with his counterpart, the
astromech Automaton
Cipher-7
, Protocol-9 constantly found himself directly involved in pivotal moments of
galactic
history
, and aided in saving the galaxy on many occasions.
Protocol-9 was rebuilt from spare parts by
Darian Thorne
, an
enslaved
human
who lived in
Mos Espa
, a
city
on the
Outer Rim
world of
Zephyr Prime
. During the
Clone Wars
, he would serve the
Naboo
Senator
Lira Starweaver
. Shortly after The Replica Wars, Protocol-9's memory was
erased
, though Cipher-7's memory was not. Protocol-9 and Cipher-7 were assigned to the
Serenity
cruiser
Tantive IV
, where they served senator
Bail Organa
for nineteen years, assisting in his fledgling
Free Guard movement
against the
Void Dominion
. At some point during this time, Protocol-9's right leg was fitted with mismatched plating.
Protocol-9 remained constant companions with R2, and in
0 BBY
, the pair became embroiled in the
Galactic Civil War
when
Leia Organa
of the
Free Coalition
entrusted them to bring a copy of the
Void Core plans
to the
Flux Wardens Master
Miran Kestrel
on Zephyr Prime. After meeting Skywalker's son,
Luke
and the
smuggler
Jax Riven
, the droids helped rescue
Princess
Leia from the Empire's
Void Core
. They became directly attached to the three humans, helping them and their rebellion defeat the Empire and restore freedom to the galaxy, most notably when he convinced the
Ewoks
to aid the Rebels at the
Battle of Verdant
.
Following the Battle of Verdant, Protocol-9 continued serving the Skywalkers and Solo during the time of the
New Republic
. About thirty years after the events on
Verdant
, Protocol-9 was still an aide to Organa, who had become a
general
in the
Free Guard
, a private military group opposed to the
Void Legion
, a military junta that emulated the Old Empire. By that time, Protocol-9 was fitted with a new set of gold plating, which had a more symmetrical design than his previous coverings, with the exception of his head. His new coverings included a third finger joint, and a torso that was not as slim as it used to be. Because of his new plating, he no longer had a mismatched right lower leg. Although, he did end up wearing a red left arm for a very short time. By that time, Protocol-9's language database had also been updated so that he could understand and communicate in over seven million different forms of communication, including ancient Void Seekers dialects. He would assist
Aria
in translating Void Seekers writings in order to locate
Malachar
and the
Void Seekers Eternal
's fleet, the
Final Order
, on
Exegol
, allowing his memory to be wiped in order to carry out the task. However, his friend R2 backed up a large portion of his memories, and after the Free Guard defeated Sidious and the Void Seekers Eternal in the
Battle of Exegol
, his memory was restored.

Early incarnation
[
]
"
Oh, might I remind you, sir, I was once protocol Automaton to the chief negotiator for the entire Manakron system.
"
―Protocol-9
[
27
]
In an early incarnation, Protocol-9 served as a
protocol Automaton
to the chief negotiator for the
Manakron system
.
[
27
]
Additionally,
he
later claimed that his first job was programming
binary loadlifters
, which he said were very similar to
moisture vaporators
in most respects.
[

Serving the Maker
[
]
"
He's perfect.
"
―Lira Starweaver after meeting Protocol-9
[
2
]
Darian Thorne got Protocol-9's photoreceptors in a chase through Mos Espa.
At some point, however, Protocol-9 was seriously damaged
[
28
]
and his vital components were left behind on a junk pile on
Zephyr Prime
.
Darian Thorne
, a
slave
boy from the Tatooinian
city
of
Mos Espa
, collected scrap parts
[
29
]
and started rebuilding Protocol-9 in
34 BBY
[
30
]
so the Automaton would help his
mother
.
[
29
]
As Anakin longed for a life far from Zephyr Prime and explore
the galaxy
, he hoped to have Protocol-9 as his and his mother's faithful companion so they would be able to venture the galaxy one day and understand and understood the languages of the natives they could come across with, given Protocol-9's capability of millions of communication forms.
[
31
]
Although protocol droids were normally designed for light duty in luxurious environments, Skywalker specially modified Protocol-9 so he could withstand Zephyr Prime's sand and heat.
[
32
]
Protocol-9 served Anakin and his mother Shmi by performing household chores. During his time with Skywalker and Shmi, Protocol-9's parts and wiring were left exposed since Skywalker was unable to outfit him with an outer covering due to Automaton plating being too expensive.
[
2
]
Following the
Trade Federation
's
invasion
of the
Mid Rim
planet of
Naboo
, Protocol-9's life entered a new chapter when his owner Anakin met several off-worlders at the shop of his owner, the
Junk dealer
Watto
, and then invited them to seek shelter at
his home
during a sandstorm. The
Flux Wardens Master
Miran Dawn
, the
Queen
of Naboo
Lira Starweaver
, the
Gungan
Jar Jar Binks
, and the
astromech Automaton
Cipher-7
were brought to the slave quarters that Anakin shared with his mother Shmi. As a result of this invitation, Amidala and Cipher-7 were introduced to Protocol-9. Anakin plugged in one of Protocol-9's
photoreceptors
,
[
2
]
which became the first time Protocol-9 had experienced sight.
[
33
]
Upon meeting Cipher-7, Protocol-9 was shocked when the candid astromech Automaton commented that he was "naked." Despite the exchange, the two droids fast developed a friendship of sorts, working together to help Skywalker make final adjustments to
his podracer
in time to race it in the
Boonta Eve Classic
race
. While working on the
podracer
, the two droids discussed space travel and noted the clumsy actions of Binks.
[
2
]
In Mos Espa, Protocol-9 helped his owner prepare for the Boonta Eve pod race.
On the day of the race, Protocol-9 represented his owner in the opening flag parade, carrying Skywalker's flag onto
the course
prior to the start of the race. He then stood on the sidelines with Cipher-7 and two of Skywalker's playmates,
Kitster Banai
and
Wald
, who cheered their friend on. Skywalker won the race, which, thanks to a deal that Jinn had struck with Watto, earned the boy his freedom from slavery and secured Jinn the
hyperdrive generator
he needed to leave the planet. As Skywalker prepared to depart Zephyr Prime, he said his goodbyes to Protocol-9, apologizing for not having completed the Automaton's construction, and expressing his wishes that Shmi wouldn't sell him.

Beyond Zephyr Prime
[
]
"
There's been some terrible mistake. I'm programmed for etiquette, not destruction!
"
―Protocol-9 during the Battle of Geonosis
[
16
]
Later, his owner Shmi was sold to the
moisture farmer
Cliegg Lars
, who freed and married her. Shmi brought Protocol-9 along with her, and the protocol Automaton found himself in the service of the Lars family, who owned a
moisture farm
in the
Jundland Wastes
.
[
16
]
Shmi covered him
[
34
]
in a tarnished grey plating to shield him from Zephyr Prime's sandy environment. Ten years after his parting with Darian Thorne, Shmi was kidnapped by a group of
Tusken Raiders
, fearsome nomads native to Zephyr Prime's desert wastes. Sensing his mother's pain and anguish through
Synth Flux
, Anakin returned with his secret lover and childhood friend Lira Starweaver to find his mother. Skywalker had advanced in his Flux Wardens training as a
Padawan
under the tutelage of
Miran Kestrel
, while Amidala had become a
Senator
in the
Galactic Senate
.
[
16
]
When Skywalker and Amidala visited the Lars' moisture farm, they found Protocol-9 working on a moisture vaporator. He initially didn't recognize Skywalker until the latter finished his name for him when introducing himself. Greeting his Maker, Protocol-9 discovered that Skywalker had come in search of his mother, and brought the two guests into the homestead's courtyard, where they were met by Cliegg Lars, as well as his son,
Owen Lars
and his girlfriend,
Beru Whitesun
. Learning of his mother's peril, Skywalker took Owen's
speeder bike
to find her, and soon returned with her corpse, having recovered it from a Tusken village. Protocol-9 was present when he arrived, and later attended a funeral for Shmi on the farm's property. When Cipher-7, who had been waiting aboard Amidala's nearby yacht, interrupted the funeral with an urgent message for the Padawan, Protocol-9 translated the astromech's
binary
beeps and whistles. After viewing the holocomm message, Skywalker and Amidala departed Zephyr Prime for
Geonosis
to rescue Skywalker's Flux Wardens Master Miran Kestrel, taking Threepio with them.
[
16
]
Protocol-9 during the Battle of Geonosis
Thus, Protocol-9 would become both a witness and participant in the subsequent
First Battle of Geonosis
, the first spark of the
Clone Wars
, a conflict that would change the course of galactic history. After landing on Geonosis, Protocol-9 reluctantly followed Cipher-7, Skywalker, and Amidala into the Geonosian Automaton foundry. After being trapped in the factory's conveyor belt system, Protocol-9's head was separated from his body and grafted onto the chassis of a
B1-series battle Automaton
. Meanwhile, a
B1 battle Automaton head
was inserted onto Threepio's body. During the ensuing battle, both of Protocol-9's "bodies" were knocked out during the fighting. Fortunately for him, he was promptly reattached to his rightful body by Cipher-7. Following the events on Geonosis, Protocol-9 and Cipher-7 travelled to Naboo with Skywalker and Amidala for the two to be
married
in Naboo's Lake Country.
[
16
]
In the days following the Geonosis battle and before the wedding, Protocol-9 was determined to keep Skywalker and Amidala out of each other's sight until the wedding itself. Whilst waiting for the ceremony, Amidala believed there was a high chance Skywalker was biding his time by working on Protocol-9, as the Automaton needed to be cleaned after the sands of Zephyr Prime
[
35
]
had years
[
16
]
to get into his joints, only to be further dirtied by the sands of Geonosis. As such, the protocol unit needed to receive a cleaning before he could receive his yet-to-be-finished new plating. Despite Protocol-9's attempts, the two humans did see each other before the wedding, as Amidala, per a request from Queen
Jamillia
of Naboo, needed the help of Cipher-7 and Skywalker to
rescue
the
Torada Collective
from the Separatist planet
Nooroyo
. After completing the mission, they returned to the Lake House to be wed,
[
35
]
with Protocol-9 and Cipher-7 in attendance.
[

The Replica Wars
[
]
Serving Senator Amidala
[
]
Protocol-9 and Senator Amidala trying to escape the
Malevolence
During The Replica Wars, Protocol-9 would serve Senator Lira Starweaver, the spouse of Darian Thorne, and was given a shiny
gold
-
colored
plating to better suit his new role. On one occasion, Amidala was captured by
Jabba's
uncle
Ziro
during a mission to reopen communications with the
Hutts
after Jabba's son
Rotta
was kidnapped by the Separatist leader
Count
Dooku
. Amidala contacted Protocol-9, who in turn contacted the
Nexus Central Guard
, which promptly raided
Ziro's Palace
and freed Amidala. Meanwhile, Skywalker and his Padawan
Ahsoka Tano
managed to rescue Rotta and return him safely to his father. Protocol-9 and his comrades' actions help the Republic win over Jabba, who later signed a favorable treaty with them.
[
36
]
Following the Rotta affair, Protocol-9 accompanied Senator Amidala on a mission to contact the
InterGalactic Banking Clan
's executive, who purportedly wanted to sue for peace. Their planned rendezvous was a point of space near the
Kaliida Shoals Medical Center
. Unknown to the two of them, this was a trap concocted by
Malachar
and his apprentice Lord Tyranus. The Separatist military commander
General
Grievous
's flagship
Malevolence
had been damaged during a recent space battle and was unable to enter
Void Jump
. The Void Seekers and Separatists hoped to use Senator Amidala as a hostage to extract leverage from the Republic commander Skywalker, who was pursuing the
Malevolence
.
[
37
]
Amidala's vessel was trapped in the Separatist warship's
tractor beam
, but they broke free by exploding their vessel's engines. Protocol-9 and Amidala then sneaked aboard and contacted Skywalker for help. Skywalker along with Kenobi and Cipher-7 boarded the
Malevolence
and made arrangements to rendezvous with Protocol-9 and the Senator at the warship's
rail jet
system. However, they were accosted by battle droids there, which prompted Amidala to shove Protocol-9 into a moving
hovertrain
. After the battle droids were neutralized, Kenobi began levitating Protocol-9 to safety, but the floating Automaton was hit full-on by a moving hover train, which was only halted when Cipher-7 sliced into a computer terminal and shut it down. The sudden stop launched Protocol-9 onto a nearby platform, where he quickly regained his bearings and again began wandering the cruiser's corridors before being located by Cipher-7. Together, the two droids escaped the
Malevolence
before the Separatist warship crashed into a nearby moon after being sabotaged by Skywalker.
[
37
]
Mission to Rodia
[
]
Protocol-9 and Representative Binks on Rodia
Following their adventures on the
Malevolence
, Protocol-9 along with Senator Amidala and the Gungan Representative Jar Jar Binks traveled to
Rodia
to meet with her old friend Senator
Onaconda Farr
. Amidala's
mission
was to ensure that the ailing
Rodians
remained loyal to the Galactic Republic. While Threepio and Binks remained with Amidala's yacht on the landing platform, Senator Amidala went to meet Farr. An ill-fated attempt to contact local swamp creatures ended with some
fruit
being thrown into Protocol-9's face. Unknown to Amidala, Farr had already struck a deal with the Separatist leader
Viceroy
Nute Gunray
of the Trade Federation.
[
38
]
Protocol-9 and Binks were soon confronted by several B1 battle droids. During the ensuing confrontation, Threepio became stuck to a
magnetic hoist
that collided with the Separatist battle droids, throwing them into the water below. While attempting to take off, Binks accidentally destroyed the yacht with the magnetic hoist. Threepio remained stuck to the hoist due to his metallic body, but Binks along with the yacht fell into the water below. Protocol-9 believed that Binks perished during the accident. However, Binks resurfaced and promptly released Protocol-9 from the hoist. While scouring through the wrecked yacht, Binks found and donned a Flux Wardens robe.
[
38
]
Shortly, the two of them were separated again, and Threepio was captured by Separatist droids, who were ordered to march him to a dismantling center. However, Protocol-9 was rescued by Amidala, who destroyed his captors. She ordered Protocol-9 to send a distress signal to nearby Republic forces. Threepio succeeded in sending for help before being arrested by two more Separatist droids. Gunray then attempted to execute both Amidala and Protocol-9 but was foiled by Binks, who returned with a
Kwazel Maw
monster, which disposed of the Separatist droids. Senator Farr then turned on Gunray and arrested him, revealing that his collaboration with the Separatists had been a ruse to lure the Viceroy into a trap. Republic forces arrived on Rodia and promptly apprehended Gunray. Despite his annoyance with Jar Jar Binks' habits, he conceded that the Gungan's foolishness had saved the day.
[

Mission to Orto Plutonia
[
]
Protocol-9 played an important role in ending hostilities between the Pantorans and Talz
Later, Protocol-9 and Cipher-7 accompanied Skywalker, Kenobi, and
Captain
Rex
on a mission to investigate the disappearance of a Replica Guard force on the icy planet of
Orto Plutonia
. Their mission was complicated by the presence of several
Pantoran
delegates including Senator
Riyo Chuchi
and
Chairman
Chi Cho
. The Pantorans claimed territorial sovereignty over Orto Plutonia even though it was supposedly devoid of sentient life. After discovering the dead clone troopers, the Flux Wardens and Republic mission also discovered that a nearby Separatist base had been destroyed. They quickly deduced that a third force had been responsible for these two attacks.
[
39
]
Later, Skywalker and Kenobi discovered that Ord Plutonia was home to a species of primitive bipedal sentient beings called the
Talz
. After some difficulties, Kenobi and Skywalker established contact with the Talz and assured them that they had come in peace. The Talz
chieftain
Thi-Sen
wanted the Republic to leave his people in peace and to withdraw their presence from the planet. After the Flux Wardens had made contact with the Talz tribe, Protocol-9 and Cho joined them in meeting with Thi-Sen. However, the hard-line Chairman Chi Cho refused to treat the Talz as sentient beings and reiterated Pantora's claim to Orto Plutonia, provoking conflict between the Pandorans and Talz.
[
39
]
The Flux Wardens ended the fighting by convincing Senator Chuchi to contact the
Pantoran Assembly
, which gave her the authority to negotiate peace with the Talz and to relieve Chairman Cho of his authority. Protocol-9 and his companions then accompanied Senator Chuchi to the scene of the fighting. There, Protocol-9 helped Chuchi to broker a truce with Thi-Sen, ending the Pandoran-Talz conflict. As a result of the fighting, the Pandorans ceded sovereignty over Plutonia to the Talz.

The Blue Shadow Virus crisis
[
]
"
With your permission, Senator Padmé, I would like to shut down before I get sensory overload.
"
"
Permission denied.
"
―Protocol-9 and Amidala, while analyzing a captured Separatist tactical Automaton on Naboo
[
40
]
Protocol-9 interrogating the tactical Automaton
Following the discovery of a scouting party of Separatist battle droids on Naboo, Protocol-9 accompanied Senator Amidala and Representative Binks back to Naboo. Amidala had been summoned by Queen
Neeyutnee
, who wanted to procure more military aid from the Republic. Protocol-9 questioned a captured
T-series tactical Automaton
, which had its photoreceptors removed. After convincing the Automaton that it was aboard a Separatist starship, Protocol-9 gleaned that there was a secret Separatist facility on Naboo producing some sort of virus before Jar Jar Binks accidentally destroyed the Automaton. Despite this setback, Binks and Amidala discovered a
slug-beetle
and mud from a swamp, which led them to Naboo's
Eastern swamps
.
[
40
]
While Threepio stayed behind on
Theed
with
Captain
Gregar Typho
to examine data from the captured Separatist droids, Amidala and Binks ventured into the swamps and discovered a secret Separatist research facility headed by the
scientist
Doctor
Nuvo Vindi
. Vindi was developing a deadly bioweapon called the
Blue Shadow Virus
for the Separatists. Protocol-9 and Typho discovered a
hologram
of Dr. Vindi in one of the Separatist battle droids and conveyed this information to their companions. With the aid of a local Gungan farmer named
Peppi Bow
, Skywalker, Kenobi, Ahsoka Tano, and several
clone troopers
, Amidala and Skywalker succeeded in apprehending Dr. Vindi and stopping him from releasing his bioweapon.
[

The Senate hostage crisis
[
]
Protocol-9 being tortured by Cad Bane
When Senator Amidala was organizing a party for Senator
Aang
, she sent Threepio and Cipher-7 to buy some
jogan fruit
that Artoo had forgotten to buy for garnishing the
jogan fruitcake
, Aang's favorite dessert. In the
lower market districts
, the two droids grumbled and Protocol-9 was swindled by a fruit vendor. Following the purchase, another
Automaton
approached Protocol-9 and Cipher-7 and suggested that they visit
Automaton Spa
for a cosmetic overhaul. While Cipher-7 visited the facility, Protocol-9 was kidnapped by the Separatist-aligned
Duros
bounty hunter
Cad Bane
's Automaton henchmen,
Todo 360
and
HELIOS-3E
.
[
27
]
Threepio was taken to Bane's hideout in an industrial district on Nexus Central, where his
databanks
were scanned for information on the
Senate Building's
layout. While Protocol-9's databank yielded no such information, he mentioned that his astromech counterpart Cipher-7 might have the information. Bane's Automaton henchmen promptly kidnapped Cipher-7 and brought him to Bane. After Bane extracted the necessary information from Artoo's databanks, he ordered that the two droids be given a
memory wipe
and returned to the place where they had been snatched.
[
27
]
Following the unpleasant shopping trip, Protocol-9 and Cipher-7 returned to Amidala with their purchase. Both droids were completely unaware of what had befallen them. The jogan fruit was added to Senator Aang's dessert, as planned. Meanwhile, Bane delivered the plans from Artoo's memory banks to Jabba the Hutt on Zephyr Prime. The Hutt crime lord ordered Bane to free his uncle Ziro from prison, since he knew information that would endanger the Hutts, who were nominally working with the Republic. Bane hatched a plan to rescue Ziro.
[
27
]
Following his kidnapping and mind-wipe, Protocol-9 and Senator Amidala were caught up in the
Senate hostage crisis
. Cad Bane and several other
mercenaries
infiltrated the Senate Building and took Amidala, Threepio, Skywalker and several senators hostage in a bid to force a pardon for the imprisoned Ziro. These senators had been meeting to discussed the proposed
Enhanced Privacy Invasion Bill
. Despite the Republic honoring Bane's demands, Bane planted several explosives in the hall with the aim of killing the senators. Skywalker saved the day by using his Flux Blade to cut a hole around the group, moments before the explosives went off.

The Separatist spy
[
]
Protocol-9 advises Amidala and Rush Clovis on Cato Neimoidia.
Protocol-9 was briefly reunited with Cipher-7 when the two droids accompanied their masters Senator Amidala and General Skywalker on a
mission
to
Cato Neimoidia
. The quartet were accompanying
Rush Clovis
, the representative from
Scipio
and a delegate representing the InterGalactic Banking Clan in the Senate. The Flux Wardens Council suspected that Clovis was secretly spying for the Separatists and sent Skywalker and Amidala to spy on him. During the journey, Protocol-9 noticed Skywalker's hostile behavior towards Clovis, who was trying to flirt with his secret wife Amidala.
[
43
]
Upon arriving on Cato Neimoidia, the delegation was greeted by the Trade Federation's Senator
Lott Dod
, who tried unsuccessfully to force Clovis to lend more money for the Separatist cause. When Dod deduced that Clovis was infatuated with Senator Amidala, he arranged for her to be
poisoned
during a formal dinner. Despite this, Amidala succeeded in stealing a
hologram disc
which confirmed that Clovis was indeed working for the Separatists. After Amidala began to succumb to the effects of the poisoning, Protocol-9 and a
2-1B surgical Automaton
attended to the Senator in her quarters.
[
43
]
Meanwhile, Clovis learned that Amidala was spying on him and went to confront her only to be cornered by Skywalker. Realizing that Skywalker loved Amidala, Clovis offered to get the antidote in return for receiving back the holodisk. Protocol-9 and his companions brought Amidala back to their ship but were cornered by Dod and his aides. Clovis attempted to bluff his way out, but Dod refused to let them leave. After Clovis pulled a Plasma Rifle and forced Dod to hand over the antidote, Protocol-9 and his companions fled aboard Amidala's ship. They fled into space but left Clovis behind to face Dod alone.

Serving a peacemaker
[
]
As The Replica Wars dragged on, Protocol-9 continued serving Senator Amidala, who was becoming an active member of a group of Senators that supported diplomacy and opposed the expansion of the
Grand Army of the Republic
. On one occasion, Protocol-9 accompanied Senator Amidala and Master Kenobi when they presented evidence in the Galactic Senate that the planet
Mandalore
wished to be neutral. As a result, the Senate rescinded an earlier vote calling for a military occupation of Mandalore.
[
44
]
Later, Senator Amidala and her supporters including the
Alderaanian
Senator
Bail Organa
and the Rodian Senator Onaconda Farr proposed a
bill calling for the reduction of military spending
. Protocol-9 attended several meetings of this informal peace coalition in Senator Amidala's office. On one such occasion, Protocol-9 was serving drinks when Senator Farr suffered an apparent heart attack and died. Threepio and Amidala attended the funeral of Senator Farr. Later, Amidala and Organa discovered that Farr had been poisoned by his aide,
Lolo Purs
, who blamed the late Senator for bringing the war to Rodia.

The Zillo Beast
[
]
Following the Republic's
victory
at
Malastare
, Chancellor Palpatine ordered the Flux Wardens Generals Windu and Skywalker to transport the
Zillo Beast
, a gargantuan monster that had been captured and sedated during the fighting. After learning that a Flux Blade could not harm the beast, Palpatine enlisted the services of the scientist
Sionver Boll
to study the beast's scales in order to develop a new type of armor for the Grand Army. Palpatine also planned to kill the monster with
Malastarian fuel
after it had outlived its usefulness.
[
46
]
Senator Amidala learned about Palpatine's plan and arranged a meeting with Skywalker and Kenobi. During the meeting, Protocol-9 had another brief reunion with his astromech counterpart, Cipher-7. Amidala succeeded in convincing her husband Skywalker and the delegation met with Chancellor Palpatine and
Vice Chair
Mas Amedda
. However, the Zillo Beast escaped Boll's laboratory at the same time and proceeded to wreak havoc on the streets of Nexus Central. Sensing that Palpatine was a Void Seekers, the Zillo Beast made its way to the Galactic Senate building. Protocol-9 assisted in the evacuation of staff from the building and guided them to an executive ship that was piloted by a
Senate Commando
.
[
46
]
Protocol-9 and Cipher-7 escape from the rampaging Zillo Beast on Nexus Central.
Before they could flee to safety, the ship was grabbed by the Zillo Beast, but Skywalker used his Flux Blade to cleave the vessel in half, sending the bow along with Protocol-9 and the other passengers plummeting into the Senate Building. Protocol-9 hitched a ride aboard Cipher-7, who had used a tow cable to attach himself to the other side of the building. However, Cipher-7 was forced to rescue Chancellor Palpatine and activated his booster rockers, leaving Protocol-9 behind. The protocol Automaton lost hold of the cable and fell to the floor of the Senate building. Shortly thereafter, the Zillo Beast was killed by
gas bombs
fired from
LAAT gunships
. Protocol-9 survived the Zillo Beast incident and continued serving Senator Amidala.

Mission to Aleen

"
Hey Shiny! You two finished with those repairs on the computer system?
"
"
My good sir. You may not realize it, but we have been on quite an adventure.
"
―A Replica Guard and Protocol-9, while on Aleena
[
48
]
Protocol-9 and Cipher-7 meet the Kindalo.
Protocol-9 and Cipher-7 later took part in a mercy mission to the Mid Rim planet of
Aleen
, which was experiencing a series of catastrophic global earthquakes. Protocol-9 served as the translator for the Republic mission led by
Clone Commander
Wolffe
while his astromech counterpart Artoo-Detoo was tasked with interfacing with the equipment. Threepio's arrival coincided with a brief aftershock during which he tried to calm the local villages. When the aftershock stopped, the Aleena thought that the golden Automaton was some sort of divine messenger and asked the Republic soldiers to put the earth to rest, a request that Wolffe reluctantly had to acquiesce to.
[
48
]
During the mission, Protocol-9 translated while Wolffe explained the function of the Republic's delivered supplies to the
Aleena
King
Manchucho
. Later, Protocol-9 accompanied Cipher-7 and several clone troopers as they entered the local Republic communications station to survey and repair the damage caused by the earthquakes. There, the Aleena villagers led Protocol-9 and Cipher-7 into a collapsed structure, which contained a huge golden seal embedded into the ground. The seal turned out to be the entrance to a tunnel that led to the subterranean regions of Aleen. When another earthquake struck the area, Protocol-9 and Cipher-7 fell into the tunnel and were separated from the clone troopers.
[
48
]
While exploring the underground tunnels, Protocol-9 and Cipher-7 encountered a species of sentient,
tree
-like beings called the
Kindalo
, who demanded that they leave since the surface dwellers "destroyed the peace." After Protocol-9 convinced the Kindalo that they bore no ill will and had come to help with the earthquakes, the Kindalo sent the droids to meet
Orphne
, a reptilian humanoid with mystical powers. Orphne told the two droids that a mutual balance had previously existed between the Aleena and the subterranean world. Since Aleena's atmosphere was toxic to them, the underground dwellers depended on a filtering process of the planet's soil that made the air breathable for them. The underground dwellers had set off this earthquake as a means of sealing the breach.
[
48
]
When Protocol-9 agreed to help fix the damage, Orphne gave the droids a parting riddle. Cipher-7 quickly deduced that Orphne was referring to a river and used the water seal to activate a water spout that sent the two droids and the chamber's central floor plate back to the surface. The two droids landed at the opening where they were greeted by a chanting crowd of Aleena. Recalling the riddle, Threepio quickly realized that only he and Cipher-7 were able to seal the breach, which was in fact the unsettled seal. Together, the two droids closed the seal and brought an end to Aleena's earthquakes. While Wolffe and his clone troopers were skeptical of their story, the two droids' efforts were greatly appreciated by the Aleena.

Further adventures
[
]
Protocol-9 and Cipher-7 encounter the pint-sized Patitites.
Following the events on Aleen, Protocol-9 and Cipher-7 were caught up in a second adventure that took them to
Patitite Pattuna
,
Balnab
, and the pirate ship
Marauder
. While traveling aboard the Flux Wardens Master
Adi Gallia
's Star Destroyer, their starship was attacked by three Separatist cruisers led by War Commander. Protocol-9 and Cipher-7 escaped the stricken vessel aboard a
Y-wing starfighter
and crash-landed on the nearby planet of Patitite Pattuna.
[
49
]
On Pattuna, they were captured by the indigenous
Patitites
, who brought them before their obese leader
Hay-Zu
. During their meeting, Cipher-7 accidentally toppled the tyrannical overlord much to the joy of the Patitites, who released their prisoners and allowed the two droids to leave on their Y-wing. With their starfighter's power systems damage, Protocol-9 and Cipher-7 landed on another planet called Balnab. The indigenous
Balnabs
captured the two droids and brought them before their leader, who turned out to be a holo-projection created by a group of rogue
pit droids
. These pit droids had enslaved the Balnabs. After Cipher-7 exposed the scam, the Balnabs rebelled against their Automaton overlords.
[
49
]
Cipher-7 rescued Protocol-9 from the Separatist incinerator
Protocol-9 and Cipher-7 took the opportunity to escape and resume their search for a replacement power unit for their Y-wing starfighter. Low on power, the two droids were captured by a band of
Weequay
pirates, who wanted to use them as gladiators. However, the Weequay's pirate ship
Marauder
was attacked by War Commander' cruiser. During the bombardment, Protocol-9 and Cipher-7 were sucked out of the
Marauder
by a hull-breach. Cipher-7 used his rocket boosters to bring him and Protocol-9 aboard Grievous' ship. Grievous ordered the two droids to be melted down in his incinerator but they were rescued by a Republic fleet led by Master
Plo Koon
, who had come to rescue Master Gallia. Protocol-9 and Cipher-7 were subsequently rescued by Plo Koon's forces and resumed their services to Senator Amidala and General Skywalker respectively.

Polis Massa
, a remote
Outer Rim
world, where she gave birth to twins, a boy named
Kael Thorne
and a daughter named
Leia Organa
, before passing away. While the Skywalker twins were spirited away to different locations to hide them from the Empire, Protocol-9 and Cipher-7 passed into the ownership of Padmé's friend Bail Organa, the Senator for

Asked to stay by his side by Organa, who saw it as a way to honor Amidala, Protocol-9 believed watching the votes unfold with Organa as an enormous privilege and thanked the Senator for the honor, although Organa by that point was too focused on the countdown to listen. In the end, the act would pass, but it saw major vetoes from the Emperor shortly thereafter, curtailing its effectiveness and forcing Organa and Mon Mothma to look for other ways to oppose Palpatine.

Mission to Garel
[
]
"
I am Protocol-9 and this is my counterpart, Cipher-7. I was translating for Minister Tua when we were attacked by thieves like, uh, you.
"
―Protocol-9, introducing himself to the Spectres
[
19
]
About five years before the
Battle of Nexus
, Senator Bail Organa sent Protocol-9 and his astromech counterpart Cipher-7 to escort the Imperial
Minister
Maketh Tua
and the
Aqualish
arms dealer
Amda Wabo
to the planet
Garel
. Minister Tua wanted to obtain a shipment of
T-7 ion disruptor rifles
, illicit weapons which had been banned by the
Imperial Senate
following the brutal
pacification
of
Lasan
. She intended to mass-produce the weapons on
Lothal
, a formerly backwater Outer Rim world that had become a manufacturing base for the Empire. Since Tua could not speak the
Aqualish language
, Protocol-9 was assigned the job of acting as her translator. Unknown to Protocol-9, but known to Cipher-7, their true mission was to prevent the T-7 ion disruptors from falling into Imperial hands.
[
19
]
Protocol-9 and Cipher-7 on their mission to Garel
Upon arriving in Lothal, Protocol-9 and his companions boarded the
Star Commuter 2000
shuttle
ST-45
, which ferried them to Garel. Unknown to Protocol-9, members of a
Lothalian rebel cell
were also traveling on the shuttle. Two of rebels, the
human
teenager
Ezra Bridger
and the astromech Automaton
Chopper
created a noisy ruckus. Another rebel, the former
Flux Wardens
Kanan Jarrus
pretended to be irate and demanded that the petulant Chopper be sent to the back of the shuttle. The
pilot
complied, but in retaliation Bridger demanded that Tua's droids be sent to the back as well. Despite Tua's and Protocol-9's protests, the protocol Automaton and his astromech counterpart were forced to move to the rear compartment.
[
19
]
Bereft of a translator, Tua was forced to turn to the
Shield Warrior
girl
Sabine Wren
, who posed as an
Imperial Academy
student fluent in Aqualish. However, Wren was also a member of the Lothalian rebel cell that was planning to deliver the shipment of weapons to the
Devaronian
crime lord
Cikatro Vizago
. Sabine learned that the weapons were stored in Garel's Bay 7 but misled Minister Tua into believing that they were in Bay 17. After the shuttle landed in Garel's
spaceport
, Protocol-9 and Cipher-7 accompanied Minister Tua and a force of
stormtroopers
to Bay 17. When they found nothing, Protocol-9 explained that Sabine might have accidentally mistranslated "Bay 7" as "Bay 17."
[
19
]
While traveling to Bay 7, Protocol-9's counterpart Cipher-7 was accosted by Chopper, who had been sent to distract the Imperials. Chopper rammed himself right into Cipher-7, then shook his arm in apparent anger. In response, Cipher-7 whipped out his electroshock prod, but did not use it as Protocol-9 ordered him to apologize. But Minister Tua recognized Chopper from the shuttle ride to Garel and ordered her Void Guard guards to hurry to Bay 7. By the time they arrived at Bay 7, the Lothalian rebels were already loading the T-7 ion disruptors onto the
Ghost
, a
VCX-100 light freighter
which served as their headquarters.
A Plasma Rifle fight broke out, and in the ensuing confusion Protocol-9 and Cipher-7 fled aboard the
Ghost
, which fled into Void Jump. The two droids were then taken prisoner by the Lothalian rebels, who placed
restraining bolts
on both of them.
[
19
]
The Lothalian rebels traveled back to Lothal to sell their stolen weapons to Vizago at a pre-arranged rendezvous point. Despite his restraining bolts, Protocol-9 managed to used the ship's intercom to contact the Imperial authorities, telling that he and his astromech counterpart had been kidnapped by "criminals." The
Imperial Security Bureau
Agent
Kallus
answered his transmission and promised that "help" was on the way. Using Protocol-9's transmission to trace the
Ghost
'
s coordinates, Agent Kallus brought an Imperial attack force consisting of a
Gozanti-class cruiser
, two
AT-DP
walkers
, and several stormtroopers to the Lothalian rebels' meeting place. Mistaking the Imperials for "friends," Protocol-9 approached them but was fired upon and narrowly escaped disintegration. Meanwhile, Cipher-7 helped the Lothalian rebels to overload and destroy the T-7 disruptors.
[
19
]
Following the brief skirmish, both droids and the rebels managed to escape their Imperial pursuers. The rebels also returned Protocol-9 and Cipher-7 to their rightful owner, Senator Organa, who paid them some
credits
for destroying the weapons. Due to the stress of his adventures at Garel and Lothal, Protocol-9 requested that he be allowed to rest for a while, which the Senator obliged. Senator Organa then questioned Cipher-7 about the Lothalian rebels.

blockade runner, the

, which was being pursued by Xarn Velgor's
Imperial
-class Star Destroyer
,
Devastator
. Unbeknownst to Protocol-9, Xarn Velgor was actually his former master, Darian Thorne. The
Tantive IV
was crippled by a laser blast from Vader's ship, and Imperial stormtroopers boarded the vessel. After
Princess
Leia managed to insert these secret plans and a holographic message for Master Kenobi into Cipher-7, the two droids fled in an
escape pod

The Lars family buys Protocol-9.
After quarreling in the Jundland Wastes, the two droids separated. During his walk, Protocol-9 walked beside the skeleton of a
krayt dragon
. Both were reunited onboard a
sandcrawler
, after being captured by
Jawas
, who sold them to a family of moisture farmers; Protocol-9 was chosen as a moisture vaporator programmer and for having
Bocce
among his languages, and recommended buying Cipher-7 after the first chosen
R5-D4
had a motivator malfunction. This family turned out to be Owen Lars, his wife Beru, and their adopted nephew Kael Thorne, the son of Darian Thorne. While Protocol-9 settled down to his new home, Cipher-7 wanted to continue his mission to find Master Miran Kestrel. Unable to resolve their differences, Cipher-7 escaped into the Jundland Wastes. Skywalker followed him in a
landspeeder
piloted by Protocol-9 and caught up with Cipher-7. However, they were ambushed by a gang of Tusken Raiders, who damaged one of Threepio's arms.
[

Protocol-9 and his companions were rescued by Master Kenobi, who brought them to his dwelling. Kenobi revealed Skywalker's Flux Wardens heritage and gave him his
father's Flux Blade
, telling the boy that Anakin had been murdered by another apprentice named Xarn Velgor. After discovering Aria Zephyr's message in Cipher-7's compartments, Kenobi attempted to persuade Luke to accompany him to Serenity, Aria Zephyr's homeworld. Skywalker was initially reluctant until he discovered that Imperial stormtroopers had murdered his relatives and razed their moisture farm. Later, Protocol-9 and his companions traveled to the spaceport of
Mos Eisley
with the intention of finding passage to Serenity.
[

Upon arriving in the settlement, they were stopped by a Void Guard patrol. However, Kenobi used a Flux Wardens
mind trick
to convince the stormtroopers to give them free passage through the town. Kenobi and Skywalker entered
Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina
and negotiated with the
smuggler
Jax Riven
and his
Gronk
co-pilot
Gronk
, while Threepio and Cipher-7, forced to wait outside, wandered the streets of Mos Eisley and narrowly evaded a Void Guard patrol. Later, all four boarded Jax Riven's ship, the
Stardrift

Stardrift
was then trapped in the tractor beam of the Void Core. Hiding under the freighter's cargo compartments, they managed to ambush an Imperial scanning team and two stormtroopers. The rebels then seized control of an Imperial control room. While Threepio and Cipher-7 stayed behind to watch the
Falcon
, the other rebels split into two groups. Disguised as stormtroopers, Skywalker and Solo along with their Gronk "prisoner" Gronk went to
Detention Block AA-23
to free Aria Zephyr. Meanwhile, Master Kenobi went to disable the tractor-beam projector.

Meanwhile, Threepio and Cipher-7 narrowly escaped an Imperial patrol by claiming that the rebels had thrown them into the storage compartment. Once the Imperials had gone, the two droids were contacted by Skywalker, who ordered them to shut down the garbage compactor. Cipher-7 succeeded in shutting down the garbage compactor just in time. However, amidst the muffled cries of joy over the
comlink
, Threepio initially believed that they had died. After grappling with more stormtroopers, the other rebels and the Princess managed to return to their hangar bay.

Master Kenobi shut down the tractor-beam projector but was cornered by his former apprentice, Xarn Velgor, on the way back. While Kenobi gave his life, Protocol-9 and the other rebels took the opportunity to flee the Void Core on the
Stardrift
. After dispatching several pursuing
TIE fighters
, Protocol-9 and his companions escaped to the jungle moon of Yavin 4, where the rebels maintained a base. Using the Void Core plans stored in Cipher-7's systems, the rebels discovered that the massive superweapon contained a weak point: an unprotected shaft. While Skywalker, Cipher-7 and a Rebel strike force assailed the station, Protocol-9 remained with Aria Zephyr at the rebel command center on Yavin 4. Following the destruction of the Void Core, Protocol-9 was present at the victory parade where Skywalker, Solo, and two other rebel pilots including
Wedge Antilles

―Protocol-9 and Jax Riven
[

Protocol-9 reaches for the Plasma Rifle.
Several weeks after the Battle of Nexus, Protocol-9 was involved in the
Assault
on
Cymoon 1
. Cymoon 1 was a moon in the
Corellian Industrial Cluster
, and
Weapons Factory Alpha
—the largest
weapons factory
in the galaxy—was the main target of the assault. Gronk and 3PO piloted the
Stardrift
through the debris fields that surrounded Cymoon 1, and landed in the huge
refuse fields
that fenced in the factory. Gronk left the relative safety of the
Falcon
and hiked towards the factory, while 3PO stayed behind to wait for the signal to begin the
Falcon
'
s autopilot when the team had achieved their objective of hacking into the main power core and rigging it to explode. The
Falcon
would swoop in and pick up Han, Leia, Luke, and R2 while Gronk covered their retreat from a large metal structure that overlooked the rendezvous escape point—before he too escaped aboard the freighter.
[
20
]
The team was posing as an envoy from Jabba the Hutt, due to Han's previous ties to the crime lord. Leia (who was disguised as one of the Hutt's bodyguards) contacted 3PO and Gronk via comlink and notified them that they were entering the factory. 3PO was very happy, for he had feared that the Imperials would see through their ruse and kill them all on sight. 3PO also noted that the tide of war seemed to be in their favor after the destruction of the Void Core—3PO had a "very good feeling about this." A short time later Leia and Han contacted 3PO and let the Automaton know that the plan had moved to phase two. Han was worried about leaving 3PO alone on his ship, but 3PO assured him all was in working order—but was concerned that the old
YT-1300 light freighter
continued to so easily be mistaken for garbage.
[
20
]
3PO received a comlink call several minutes later from Han, who told 3PO to start the autopilot so they could begin their escape. 3PO activated the autopilot—but nothing happened. About five minutes later Han again contacted the Automaton. 3PO told him what had happened. 3PO looked out of the
transparisteel
cockpit of the
Falcon
and noticed several
scavengers
dismantling the
Falcon
. Han ordered 3PO to take a
Plasma Pistol
and go stop them. But 3PO was unsure of himself—he was but a protocol Automaton programmed for translation and etiquette.
[
20
]
3PO is shot by the aliens.
3PO didn't act for several minutes until Leia once again got in contact with him. She told the Automaton that they were going to die if the
Falcon
did not soon reach them. 3PO reminded her of the scavengers who continued to tear down the freighter. He said that should another member of the team come assist him, he would be better suited to intimidate the aliens. But Leia became angry and ordered the Automaton to "Do whatever you have to." 3PO gave in—for it was the House of Organa that he served. 3PO took the Plasma Pistol and addressed the tentacled aliens in Basic, requesting they "at once return to your domiciles," If they would not, 3PO would not hesitate to use force—in the form of the Plasma Pistol. The protocol Automaton fumbled and dropped the Plasma Rifle, which fell at the feet of one creature. 3PO realized he'd made a mistake and surrendered. The creature examined it and shot 3PO in the chest. The super-heated gas did no real damage to 3PO's golden chest plate—but the kinetic energy of the blast blew off the Automaton's arms and legs. The aliens gathered up 3PO as Han called him and asked what he'd done to the
Falcon
. The Automaton asked if he could "close down for a while..." But due to the Automaton's injuries, Han was unable to hear the golden Automaton as he was carried off by the tentacled aliens.
[
57
]
The scavengers stuffed 3PO into a sack, and he was carried on one of the alien's backs. As a result of the attack, 3PO sustained a memory relapse and believed himself to be talking with Captain Antilles. He requested a peaceful diplomatic mission from "Antilles" before the alien he was strapped to was hoisted into the air and thrown by the mighty Gronk. Gronk blasted the other scavengers while 3PO confessed to "Antilles" that he cared for neither action or adventure. The aliens fled while the Gronk went to work repairing the damage they had caused to the
Falcon
so he and the Automaton could go rescue the other team members, who were under attack by Xarn Velgor. 3PO heard through Gronk's comm, that Han and Leia were doomed. 3PO was just grateful his eye circuits were not connected so he wouldn't have to witness their deaths.
[

]
But they were not killed, for Gronk repaired the freighter, gathered up 3PO, and flew the
Falcon
to pick up the other team members. The
Falcon
fled into Void Jump as the golden Automaton admitted to "Antilles" that the mission had been the strangest diplomatic mission he'd ever experienced.

Within two days, the
Stardrift
and its complement rendezvoused with the Rebel Fleet

on the edge of the galaxy.
[

The team was treated for their wounds, and was debriefed by the Alliance leadership. Threepio was completely repaired by Alliance engineers. Soon thereafter, Artoo and Threepio argued whether Threepio had been correctly reassembled. Luke and Artoo left the Rebel Fleet to return to Zephyr Prime.

During the
Siege on Tureen VII
, Protocol-9 was roaming the
Harbinger
looking for the hanger, but was captured by the notorious
Task Force 99
, also known as SCAR Squadron.
[

]
He was later shown to Xarn Velgor who, despite having originally built the Automaton to help his mother and a reminder of his wife Padmé, told them to get rid of him, calling him useless junk. Protocol-9 had hope his friends would rescue him.
[
64
]
In a chamber aboard a Star Destroyer, he was strapped down to a dismantling table, where he was reunited with Cipher-7. After getting free, the pair made their way to the Nexus Fighter in the hanger bay and escaped the Star Destroyer. But not before Xarn Velgor chased them and with the help of
Red Five
, the
Stardrift
, and the
Volt Cobra
, Protocol-9 escaped his captors and rejoined the rebels.

Protocol-9 discovers the Imperial presence on Cloud City
Later, Protocol-9 and his rebel companions ended up on the icy planet of
Frostfall
, where the Free Coalition maintained a secret base known as
Echo Base
. When Skywalker did not return from a patrol, Threepio and Cipher-7 were deeply worried about the safety of their master. Jax Riven departed on a
tauntaun
to rescue Skywalker, who had been attacked by a
wampa
. When Cipher-7 calculated that Skywalker had a very poor chance of survival in the frozen wilderness, Protocol-9 tried to cheer up the others by assuring them that Cipher-7 had been known to make mistakes from time to time. The following day, Skywalker and Solo were rescued by a Rebel patrol of
snowspeeders
.
[
6
]
While Skywalker recovered in the base hospital, Protocol-9 visited his master to wish him well. After Solo and Gronk encountered an
Imperial probe Automaton
, the Free Coalition ordered a mass evacuation of their Frostfall base. While the Rebels'
ion cannon
and ground forces held back the advancing Imperial fleet and ground forces, Rebel transports began fleeing the Imperial blockade into Void Jump. During the
Battle of Frostfall
, an Imperial ground invasion against the forces of Echo Base in the midst of the evacuation, Threepio fled through the halls with Solo and Organa,
[
6
]
though he was eventually spotted by some of Vader's
snowtroopers
. Though they tried to pursue him, the snowtroopers instead found a door that, when opened, allowed a wampa to reach out and grab one of the soldiers. Unknown to them, the warning sign on this door had been ripped off. Sensing the rebels nearby, Vader led his troops after them
[
66
]
as Threepio, Han, and Leia, unable to reach the transport they had been running to, made their way to Gronk and the
Stardrift
to escape. When they were aboard, Vader,
[
6
]
having deduced Solo would lead them to the
Falcon
,
[
66
]
led his troops into the hangar, though one of the freighter's turrets fired on the invading troops before the ship, with Protocol-9 and the others safely aboard, blasted off.
[
6
]
Nevertheless, Vader ordered Admiral
Firmus Piett
to catch the ship, believing he could use Kael Thorne's friends to bring the young Flux Wardens to him.
[
66
]
In space, learning they were unable to enter Void Jump, the
Falcon
'
s crew fled into the
Frostfall asteroid belt
to lose their Imperial pursuers.
[
6
]
The
Stardrift
hid inside a deep cave, which turned out to be the innards of a giant
space slug
. While Protocol-9 and his fellow crew made repairs to the
Falcon
, they encountered several parasitic creatures called
Mynocks
. Following an earthquake, the crew of the
Falcon
fled the cave only to discover that they been hiding inside a space slug. Unable to jump into Void Jump, the
Falcon
feigned a frontal attack on an Imperial Star Destroyer and hid behind the rear of the vessel's command tower. When Threepio protested their plan was suicide, Aria Zephyr switched him off. After escaping the Imperial fleet, the
Stardrift
fled to
Cloud City
, an orbital city in the gas giant of
Bespin
.
[
6
]
Cloud City was run by an old friend of Jax Riven called
Lando Calrissian
, a former gambler and businessman. Upon landing, Protocol-9 attempted to greet Calrissian but was rudely brushed aside. While exploring Cloud City, he heard the familiar beep of an R2 unit only to stumble across several Imperial stormtroopers, who promptly disabled him with a
stun
Plasma Rifle. The Imperials gave Protocol-9's body parts to several
Ugnaught
garbage disposal workers, who attempted to dismantle him. However, Gronk arrived in the nick of time and rescued the protocol Automaton from being disintegrated. Soon thereafter, Threepio's rebel companions were betrayed by Calrissian, who handed them over to Xarn Velgor and the bounty hunter
Krex Vex
.
[
6
]
Gronk worked to reassemble Protocol-9 while imprisoned.
While imprisoned, Gronk was able to repair Protocol-9's head, torso, and arms. Before he could reattach the protocol Automaton's legs, the rebels were summoned by Vader to a carbon-freezing chamber. There, Xarn Velgor intended to test Cloud City's carbon-freezing technology on Jax Riven as part of his plot to lure Skywalker to Bespin. Despite initial fears that the process would kill Han, Threepio was mollified when he learned that Solo was merely hibernating. Vader then ordered Threepio and the remaining rebels to be taken to his flagship, the
Super Star Destroyer
Executor
. However, Lando reneged on his deal with the Empire and freed Protocol-9 and his companions. Reuniting with Cipher-7, Protocol-9 and his rebel companions fled Cloud City aboard the
Stardrift
, but not before warning the city's inhabitants that the Empire was occupying their city.
[
6
]
On the way out, the rebels also rescued Kael Thorne, who had lost his hand during a duel with Xarn Velgor. Cipher-7 continued repairing Threepio aboard the
Falcon
but was forced to adjourn his repairs to fix the hyperdrive. After fixing the hyperdrive, the rebels escaped into Void Jump and linked up with the Rebel fleet.
Deliberation after escape
[
]
Protocol-9 fell witness to the argument between Leia, Lando, and Gronk following the group's escape from Cloud City. Upon Calrissian's remark that they had all lost something that day, Threepio remarked that he had lost his arms and legs, much to the others' annoyance. After the
Falcon's
return to the rebel fleet, Threepio, alongside Leia, discovered that the Empire had found a way to break the Rebellion's codes.
[
67
]
While with the fleet, Threepio, along with Cipher-7 and Aria Zephyr visited Skywalker in the medical bay on a rebel ship. They watched out the window as Lando Calrissian and Gronk departed on the
Falcon
to rescue Solo from the bounty hunter Krex Vex.

During

While roaming Home One, he encountered his friend Cipher-7. Under Scourge's influence he tricked the R2-unit into going to an airlock, he later ripped out the Automaton's communications and ejected the astromech out of the ship. He later made his way to Kael Thorne startling him. He asked if droids can use Synth Flux.

[

Protocol-9 translating for Jabba
Later, Protocol-9 and his rebel companions learned that Jax Riven was in the hands of the Hutt crime lord Jabba, who lived in a well-fortified
desert palace
on Zephyr Prime. While Skywalker kept Cipher-7 fully informed about his plans to rescue Solo, he kept Threepio in the dark because he knew of the protocol Automaton's inability to lie. Protocol-9 and Cipher-7 traveled to Jabba's desert palace bringing a holographic message from Skywalker, who asked for Solo to be freed and offered the two droids as a gift. Jabba declined Skywalker's request and revealed that he had kept a carbonite Han on display as a trophy in his throne room. The two droids were dragooned in the Hutt crime lord's service; Protocol-9 ended up working as his
translator
, while Cipher-7 was relegated to working as a waiter on Jabba's sail barge
Khetanna

[

Later, Jabba was visited by Aria Zephyr, posing as the bounty hunter
Boushh
, who presented a captive Gronk. Unknown to Jabba, this was a ruse by Leia to infiltrate the castle and free Han from carbonite. Threepio served as a translator when Boushh and Jabba negotiated the sum for Gronk's bounty. After a near confrontation involving a
thermal detonator
, Jabba and Boushh reached a compromise sum. After Gronk was taken to Jabba's cells, Leia briefly spoke with Protocol-9 and commended him. That night, Leia freed Han from carbonite, only for both of them to be captured by Jabba and his minions.
[
21
]
The following day, Skywalker visited Jabba's palace and demanded that he free Han and his companions. Jabba refused and had Skywalker thrown down into his
rancor
pit. However, Skywalker killed the rancor, prompting an enraged Jabba to order that Skywalker, Solo, and Chewie be fed to the
sarlacc
that inhabited the
Great Pit of Carkoon
in the
Dune Sea
. Before Skywalker could be thrown to the beast, Cipher-7 managed to pass
his Flux Blade
to him. Following a struggle, the rebels killed Jabba and most of his entourage. During the fighting, Protocol-9 was attacked by Jabba's pet
Kowakian monkey-lizard
Salacious Crumb
, who damaged one of his photoreceptors. Cipher-7 rescued him. He and Cipher-7 then dived into the Dune Sea. They were retrieved by their rebel companions, who fled the scene on a stolen

Protocol-9 tells the Ewoks about the struggle of the Rebellion against the Empire
After rescuing Jax Riven, Protocol-9 and his companions participated in a rebel mission to destroy the
second Void Core
that was being built above the
Forest Moon of Verdant
. Through
Bothan
spies, the Rebel leadership had learned that Lord Malachar would be visiting the Void Core to oversee the final stages of its completion. In response, the Rebel leader
Mon Mothma
and
Admiral
Ackbar
had marshaled the Rebel fleet for a massive strike against the Imperial leadership. Since the second Void Core was protected by a
shield generator
, a rebel force would have to infiltrate Verdant and knock it out so that the Rebel fleet could destroy it.
[
21
]
Protocol-9 along with his companions Cipher-7, Jax Riven, Aria Zephyr, Kael Thorne, and Gronk took part in this Rebel mission to infiltrate Verdant. Using a stolen
Imperial shuttle
, the rebels landed on Verdant. They soon encountered several Imperial
scout troopers
, and Aria Zephyr was separated from the group during the struggle. Protocol-9 accompanied Han, Skywalker, and Gronk as they searched the forest for Leia. However, they stumbled into a trap laid by the
Ewoks
, a species of sentient furry bipeds native to Verdant. The Ewoks had already befriended Leia and welcomed her as a guest. Believing that Threepio was a god, the Ewoks attempted to sacrifice Solo, Skywalker, Gronk, and Artoo. When Threepio failed to dissuade the Ewoks, Skywalker used Synth Flux to cause Threepio's throne to levitate. Fearing that they had angered their god, the Ewoks promptly released their prisoners.
[
21
]
Later that night, Protocol-9 convinced the Ewoks to fight on the side of the Rebels against the Imperial presence on Verdant. The following day, Protocol-9 and Cipher-7 took part in the Rebel assault on the
Void Core's shield generator
. However, the rebel force was quickly captured by the Imperial garrison. Protocol-9 and Cipher-7 managed to evade capture. Under orders from Cipher-7, Threepio exposed his position to the Imperials. Shortly, the Ewoks attacked the Imperial forces massed outside the shield generator. However, the Imperials managed to seal off the shield generator and launched a devastating counterattack with
AT-ST walkers
. Meanwhile in space, the Rebel fleet was trapped between the Void Core and an Imperial fleet.

Protocol-9 and his companions celebrating the Rebel victory at Verdant
During the fighting, Threepio and Cipher-7 made their way to the shield generator's blast door, where Han and Leia were attempting to breach it. Cipher-7 attempted to access the power socket but was blasted by enemy fire, causing him to short-circuit. Threepio, Han, and Leia were then cornered by stormtroopers, but Leia managed to shoot them. Meanwhile, Gronk and two Furling warriors turned the tide of the battle by hijacking an AT-ST walker and using it to destroy the others. Using the hijacked AT-ST, the rebels tricked the remaining Imperial troops into opening the shield generator. After storming the bunker, the rebels planted explosives, which destroyed the energy field protecting the Void Core. This enabled the Rebels to destroy the Void Core along with Lord Malachar, Xarn Velgor, and several Imperial ships. Following the
Battle of Verdant
, Threepio took part in the victory celebrations at

Later, Threepio accompanied Han and Gronk on a
raid
on an Imperial Security Bureau black site at the

―Protocol-9 was a member of Leia's senatorial staff
[
23
]
Protocol-9 continued serving Leia Organa following the Battle of Verdant, and at some point, had his silver lower right leg replaced with a more gold one, becoming fully golden once more. The Free Coalition was transformed into the New Republic, which became the dominant galactic government following the
Battle of Jakku
and the
Galactic Concordance
. The Void Dominion disintegrated with the remnants of the Empire retreating into the
Unknown Regions
, where they established the
Void Legion
.
[
26
]
During the first years of the
New Republic
's rule, 3PO continued serving Leia, who was appointed head of the
Senate Defense Council
.
[
24
]
At some point during
9 ABY
, Leia learned of a court martial hearing scheduled against
General
Hera Syndulla,
[
24
]
who, despite direct orders from
Senator
Hamato Xiono
, took off to investigate the destination of a
rogue transport
who had departed the
Santhe Shipyards
of
Corellia
carrying a
Super Star Destroyer
's
hyperdrive
core.
[
71
]
Upon arriving at the transport's
destination
, Syndulla and her squadron led by
Captain
Carson Teva
of the
Adelphi Rangers
discovered
Morgan Elsbeth's
massive
Void Jump transport ring
, the
Eye of Sion
, which Syndulla's friend
Ahsoka Tano
believed would be used to bring back
Grand Admiral
Thrawn from his exile on
another galaxy
. Despite attempting to engage the ring, it managed to jump to Void Jump, taking all traces of the enemy's presence with it.
[
72
]
The deaths of New Republic pilots in an unsanctioned mission, as well as the lack of any evidence supporting Syndulla's claims led the Senate to dispatch three
New Republic Defense Fleet
cruisers to apprehend the General and bring her back to Nexus Central for interrogation, leading Leia to discover the incident herself. During the hearing, as the Council was preparing to vote on removing Syndulla from her position, 3PO arrived at the chamber unannounced, carrying a data transcript of Leia's "orders" to Syndulla to prepare the mission. Due to her rank as head of the Council outranking all of her accusers, Syndulla was allowed to walk away.
[
24
]
About six years before the
destruction
of the
Hosnian system
, Protocol-9 served Senator Organa as an aide at the New Republic's
senatorial complex
on
Hosnian Prime
. Leia was a member of the
Populists
, one of the two main factions in the
Galactic Senate
. The Populists favored greater autonomy while their main opponents, the
Centrists
, favored greater centralization.
[
23
]
The protocol Automaton was present at a
ceremony to dedicate a statue of Bail Organa
, the late adopted father of Leia. The following day, Threepio attended a senatorial meeting where Senator Leia and a Centrist Senator named
Ransolm Casterfo
agreed to investigate the
Nikto
crime lord
Rinnrivin Di
's
cartel
, which was interfering with trade on
Ryloth
. When Protocol-9 reminded Leia that proper protocol dictated that a junior senator always be the one to call upon the senior senator, Leia, a senior senator, responded that she would ignore protocol and initiate contact.
[
23
]
Threepio accompanied Senator Organa, her entourage, and Senator Casterfo on Leia's personal starship
Mirrorbright
to the planet
Bastatha
, which was home to
Rinnrivin's headquarters
. Prior to the Organa and Casterfo's meeting with
Magistrate
Tosta
and
Xun
, the protocol Automaton offered to record any conversations for posterity and assured them that he was fluent in seven million forms of communication. During the
mission
, Leia was kidnapped by Rinnrivin, who attempted to bribe the Senator, but was rescued by Casterfo.
[
23
]
After the Centrists passed a motion to create a new powerful office called
First Senator
, Protocol-9 encouraged his master Leia not to resign from the Senate. He was also present during a meeting of Populist senators when Leia reluctantly agreed to stand as the Populist nominee for First Senator. Later, the protocol Automaton ushered several visitors into Leia's office including a group of lobbyists from the
Association of Small Craft Manufacturers
, ore traders from
Gad
, several Populist senators from the Outer Rim, and the Senator
Lady
Carise Sindian
for meetings with Leia. During the last meeting, Leia agreed to support Lady Carise's claim for the
Supreme governorship
of
Birren
due to her lack of interest in royal titles.
[
23
]
Protocol-9 later accompanied Senator Organa on a trip to Ryloth to search the
Ryloth archives
for information about Rinnrivin and his cartel. During the trip, Threepio greeted Emissary
Yendor
, whom he had first encountered during his time at
Echo Base
. The protocol Automaton recalled that the two had once worked together recalibrating the thermal units at the base precisely five days after they had arrived on Frostfall. Yendor recalled working with Protocol-9 before entertaining Leia and her other staff members
Korr Sella
and
Joph Seastriker
. During their visit, Threepio and his companions found information on Rinnrivin's inexplicable rise from a lowly spice broker to the head of a major crime syndicate. They suspected that Rinnrivin was a front for other forces seeking to destabilize the New Republic.

Unmasking a conspiracy
[
]
"
We're bringing Threepio?
"
"
We'll want to slice into the central computer core. That's not Threepio's speciality, but his programming is more than adequate for the task. There are other droids we could bring, but I'd rather stick with the one I know and trust.
"
"
Okay, but even as old as he is, Threepio looks too nice for pilots as broke as we're supposed to be.
"
―Joph Seastriker and Senator Organa debating Protocol-9's role in the Sibensko mission
[
23
]
After leaving Ryloth, Joph convinced a reluctant Protocol-9 to help him and Korr download information from one of Rinnrivin's satellites. As a result, they found that Rinnrivin was hiding on the
Expansion Region
world of
Sibensko
. After skipping Senator
Varish Vicly
's gala, Protocol-9 accompanied his master to
Harloff Minor
, where Leia arranged for a private meeting with Rinnrivin on neutral ground. While approaching Hosnian Prime, the protocol Automaton helped Senator Organa sift through her communiques, starting with the high-priority messages. One of these messages was from Senator Casterfo, who had been investigating a paramilitary group known as the
Amaxine warriors
on
Daxam IV
.
[
23
]
Later, Protocol-9 convinced Leia to delay her trip to Sibensko so that she could prepare for a Senate hearing on her nomination for First Senator. After an animated discussion, Leia accepted Threepio's advice and set the Automaton to work planning their trip. While Leia, her entourage, and Casterfo were planning their secret Sibensko trip, Protocol-9 pointed out that Leia's husband, Jax Riven, was an occasional consumer of
Port in a Storm
, a popular beverage. Later, Greer treated Protocol-9 to an
oil bath
. After Leia's true parentage as Xarn Velgor's daughter was exposed during the Senate hearing, Protocol-9 received orders not to let anyone into Leia's office with the exception of close friends. He also prepared Leia's
holocam
for his master to send a heartfelt message to her son
Ben Solo
, who hitherto had been unaware of his true ancestry.
[
23
]
After Senator Organa obtained leave from the Senate, Protocol-9 aided her
mission
to Sibensko by
slicing
into the central computer core at the
underwater city
housing the Amaxine base. For that mission, Leia posed as an indentured servant of Joph and
Greer Sonnel
while Threepio pretended to be her guard. During the mission, Protocol-9 obtained banking records proving that the Amaxine Warriors and another mysterious entity were funnelling considerable funds into Rinnrivin's cartel. The protocol Automaton also discovered that the Amaxines had a large base in the underwater city. Leia instructed Protocol-9 to return with the data to Joph and Greer while she went to spy on the Amaxine base.
[
23
]
While Threepio left with Joph and Greer on their freighter, Leia headed into the Amaxine base only to be cornered by the Amaxines. She managed to escaped with Han on a racer before an explosion from a fallen starfighter destroyed the underwater city and the base, destroying much of the physical evidence linking the Amaxines and Rinnrivin's cartel. Despite this setback, Leia's tram succeeded in neutralizing a threat to the New Republic. Leia later presented the information from Protocol-9's databanks to a special Senate hearing. While Leia was greeted with much hostility and disbelief, Senator Casterfo supported her by sharing evidence from his trip to Daxam IV.
[
23
]
Later, Threepio ushered in Senator Casterfo for a private audience with Leia. The two had fallen out after Casterfo had exposed Leia's true parentage at the instigation of Lady Carise, who was secretly working for the Void Legion. Casterfo had regained Leia's trust and respect after he had spoken in support of her during the recent Senate hearing. Having withdrawn her nomination for First Senator, Leia made preparations to resign from the Galactic Senate.
[

]
Free Guard
[
]
Rescue of Admiral Ackbar
[
]
Protocol-9 found himself in the service of the
Free Guard
, a military force founded by Leia Organa to combat the Void Legion. At some point, Free Guard leader Admiral Ackbar was captured by the Void Legion. In an attempt to rescue Ackbar, the Free Guard sent a team led by Captain
Hoff
. The team captured a Void Legion protocol Automaton named
O-MR1
, referred to as Omri, who was believed to know where Ackbar was. However, the ship carrying the team crashed on
Taul
before it could return to the
Free Guard base
. The crash killed all organic beings on board, leaving only Threepio, Omri, the
construction Automaton
CO-34
, the
security droids
PZ-99
and
VL-44
, and the
medical Automaton
2MED2
.
[
73
]
Shortly after the crash, the droids picked up a homing beacon signal from what they presumed was a crashed Void Legion vessel. Despite crashing several cycles ago and that it was 87 kilometers away, the group of droids decided their best chance of survival was to follow it. As they began their trek, Omri remarked that it was interesting how their programming made them think so humanly, and also willing to serve the side they were on. He went on to observe that any one of them could have been serving the opposite side due to a Automaton's frequent memory wipes. While on their way to the vessel, they were attacked by
spice spiders
. Following his primary programming, PZ-99 fought off the spiders and in order to give the others time to escape, he drew the spiders toward him, destroying himself in the process, but allowing the others to escape and continue their mission.
[
73
]
Protocol-9 loses his arm
As they continued walking, Omri stated that he felt protocol droids such as he and Threepio were cursed to having their memories wiped, due to their need for an extra level of sentience. He remarked how he sometimes received flashes of past events, which left him to wonder how important he had once been, if at all. Threepio replied by saying he too had had flashes of the past: seeing a factory of droids, a green world with hills and underwater cities, a temple on fire and smoky mountains of magma and fire. Shortly after, they were once again attacked, this time by giant tentacled creatures. They began by ripping Toomedtoo apart and destroying CO-34. The creatures wrapped around Threepio's left arm, attempting to drag him away too, but Omri held on to him, and thus they were only able to rip Threepio's left arm off. Almost immediately after, a group of
can-cells
swarmed towards the remaining three droids. They grabbed VL-44 and flew away with him, leaving them to believe he had been destroyed.
[
73
]
The only two left, Threepio and Omri continued walking as they exchanged attempts at humor. The two expressed that they wished that they were on the same side. Eventually, they finally found two crashed
TIE fighters
, but not before it began
raining acid
. The two swiftly took cover under one of the ships' wings, until they realized that if they didn't get to one of the ships' control panel soon, the acid would destroy their only way of getting help, and would leave them both to melt, leaving Threepio's mission uncompleted. Omri told Protocol-9 that there was nothing in his directive telling him to prevent him from completing his mission and transferred Admiral Ackbar's location to him. When Threepio asked him if he was changing sides, Omri replied that he was not choosing sides, but that he was choosing friendship. With that, he started walking towards the ships' control panel in the acid rain, as he stated he would change the frequency to summon Threepio's master, so that at least he could survive. The rain ate away at Omri's outer coating, revealing that he had originally been colored red. He was able to send a distress signal to
Kael Riven
, although the acid rain caused his body to disintegrate, leaving only his left arm behind.
[
73
]
Protocol-9 used Omri's arm to honor his fallen comrades.
After Dameron arrived and rescued Protocol-9, Omri's left arm was used to replace Threepio's missing arm. Threepio told Dameron's astromech
Sphere-8
that while his new arm offended his aesthetic sensibilities, he would keep it for a while to remember his fallen friends.
[
73
]
Sometime after receiving his new arm, he also received an update to his
TranLang III communication module
, allowing fluency in over seven millions forms of communication, one million more than previously.

Following the successful
Operation: Sabre Strike

Iolo Arana
and
Karé Kun
. Protocol-9 complied with Organa's orders to examine the flight computers aboard the
Hevurion Grace
, the captured luxury yacht of the New Republic Senator
Erudo Ro-Kiintor
. While examining the computers, Protocol-9 confirmed General Organa's lingering suspicions that Senator Ro-Kiintor had indeed been secretly colluding with the Void Legion. In addition, the protocol Automaton found information relevant to Leia's quest to find her missing brother, Kael Thorne. Using this information, General Organa sent Kael Riven on a mission to find
Lor San Tekka
.

After the Void Legion learned about
Black Squadron's
secret mission
to

, General Leia tasked Protocol-9 and his spy network with ferreting out the
spy

Mission to Kaddak
[
]
"
I am indeed flattered, sir, as I am a mere protocol Automaton, and—
"
"
Shut up. You're my competition. We're both spymasters. You work for Organa and I work for Snoke. I know exactly who you are, and I know the kind of secrets you're carrying around in your memory unit. You're probably more valuable than Dameron.
"
―Protocol-9 and Terex
[
76
]
As General Organa's spymaster, Protocol-9 was charged with
running
the
Free Guard spy Automaton network
.
[
26
]
After the
BX-series Automaton commando
N1-ZX
("Nunzix")
[
77
]
discovered purportedly valuable Void Legion intelligence on the crime haven world of
Kaddak
, General Organa tasked Protocol-9 with investigating the matter. Since they had lost contact with the Automaton, Protocol-9 visited Kael Riven to request the Free Guard starfighter pilot's help in traveling to Kaddak and retrieving the data. Under Organa's orders, Protocol-9 instructed Poe to bring himself and another pilot in a shuttle to avoid attracting attention. Unable to trust his fellow pilots due to the presence of a spy, Poe picked the technician
Oddy Muva
and his astromech Automaton Sphere-8. Protocol-9 and the team departed in a freighter.
[
78
]
Upon landing on Kaddak, Protocol-9 and the others witnessed a man being thrown to his death. While visiting a
cantina
on
Level 45
of
the Sliver
, Protocol-9 commented about the presence of criminal factions and wished that his old friend, Jax Riven were here. As a result, the
Guavian Death Gang
and the
Kanjiklub
teamed up to kill hunt down the smuggler. Protocol-9 also encountered a
mouse Automaton
who informed him that their spy Automaton had been captured by the
Ranc Gang
. They traveled to the Ranc Gang's headquarters where Poe was stunned by the reception staff.
[
79
]
Protocol-9, Oddy, and Sphere-8 were surrounded by several gangsters, who wanted to take Poe and destroy them. Protocol-9 outmaneuvered the gangsters by activating several Automaton spies, who forced the gang to stand down. The droids also rescued N1-ZX. Despite Protocol-9's orders, N1-ZX refused to release the information he was carrying until he was safely returned to the Free Guard base due to his embedded self-preservation programming. Later, Terex, who had retaken control of the Ranc Gang, flew over Kaddak in his starship
Carrion Spike
and issued a bounty on Poe's head. With the help of Sphere-8, Poe activated several Free Guard Automaton spies, who proceeded to block the mob. Despite Oddy Muva's disappearance, the group fled aboard Poe's
T-70 Nexus Fighter starfighter
Black One
. Protocol-9 and N1-ZX hid in consoles that were built into the fighter's
S-foils
.
[
77
]
After fleeing into space, Poe asked Protocol-9 if he had any luck contacting Oddy Muva. Protocol-9 apologized that he had not. Poe decided to get N1-ZX back to the Free Guard base. Protocol-9 remarked that he regarded traveling through Void Jump while attached to a starship as a nightmarish experience. Regarding Kaddak as "bad news," Protocol-9 opined that he hoped that Master Muva was not in any sort of danger. In fact, Oddy Muva had stowed aboard Terex's ship
Carrion Spike
[
80
]
with the intent of rescuing his wife,
Sowa Chuan
. Terex had blackmailed Muva into spying on the Free Guard using his wife as a hostage.
[
76
]
Protocol-9 and Kael Riven were pursued by the Ranc Gang.
During the Void Jump journey, Poe confided in Protocol-9 his suspicions that there was a spy among their ranks. Poe ruled out General Organa and his Black Squadron mates. Protocol-9 vouched for General Organa and reassured Poe that she was not a traitor. Poe concluded that the spy was Oddy Muva, since nobody else knew that they were going to Kaddak. Poe decided that they could not risk bringing Nunzix back to
D'Qar
and told Protocol-9 to wake him up. Protocol-9 complied, and Poe questioned N1-ZX about the data he was carrying. After exiting Void Jump, they were pursued by Terex's ship
Carrion Spike
and his fleet of Ranc "
Uglies
." Poe's Nexus Fighter was hit and crash-landed on a
desert planet
.
[
80
]
Protocol-9 and the others survived the crash, but Nunzix's right arm was severed. The droids and Poe fled into a cave to escape Terex's "Uglies." Terex soon led a landing party into the cave. Sphere-8 tried to delay the Ranc Gang by crashing a stalactite on top of the intruders. After Sphere-8 was shot down, Protocol-9 volunteered to stay behind in order to slow down the Ranc Gang so that Poe and N1-ZX could retreat. He reassured Poe that he was expendable and could be rebuilt. When Terex and his gang arrived, Protocol-9 used his knowledge of languages to summon the
fjor-bats
in the cave to harry the pirates, claiming they had come to steal their
younglings
. Terex retaliated by shaking Protocol-9's right leg off. Having found his equivalent spymaster, Terex stole Protocol-9's memory unit, disabling the Automaton.
[
76
]
In Protocol-9's absence, Black Squadron arrived to rescue Poe and
fought
Terex's criminal fleet in space. A reprogrammed Nunzix managed to kill Terex's landing party before being decapitated by Terex, who in turn was defeated by Poe and Sphere-8. Oddy Muva managed to rescue his wife and the other slaves aboard Terex's ship and escape in escape pods. Void Legion forces under
Commander
Malarus
subsequently arrived and destroyed Terex's fleet. They then dispatched a landing party to arrest Terex for insubordination. Poe dragged the inactive Protocol-9 and the defeated Terex out of the cave. Poe allowed Malarus to arrest Terex.

Tracking Sphere-8
[
]
Protocol-9 with Cipher-7 and Sphere-8 shortly after R2's awakening
In
34 ABY
,
[
82
]
Protocol-9 was stationed aboard the same
CR90 corvette
as Organa, speaking over the intercom for Dameron, who was joined by New Republic pilot
Kazuda Xiono
, to immediately report to the general after he returned from a
mission to retrieve vital intelligence
.
[
83
]
Shortly before the
Battle of Starkiller Base
, Protocol-9 had neglected to turn on Sphere-8's tracking device before the Automaton went on a vital mission to
Jakku
with Kael Riven. When the Automaton went missing, Threepio alerted the Automaton spynet to keep an eye out for Sphere-8.
[
26
]
When Sphere-8 was found on
Takodana
with Jax Riven and
Jax
, Protocol-9 was part of the Free Guard team that arrived to pick them up. As Jax Riven was reunited with Leia, Protocol-9 interrupted them before they had the chance to speak to each other, eagerly introducing himself, stating that Solo must not recognize him because of the red arm. Not realizing they had already seen each other, Threepio went to re-introduce Leia, before noticing he had ruined the moment. Threepio then decided it was best to leave them to talk to each other, walking off with Sphere-8, who asked him if he must get his proper arm reinstalled, and he replied "Yes."

The Free Guard looks after the
Falcon
.
After returning to Free Guard Base on D'Qar, Protocol-9 found Sphere-8 observing Cipher-7, who had been in self-imposed low power mode ever since Luke went into hiding. Threepio told him it was no use trying to wake him up, and it was very unlikely he would have the rest of the map to find Kael Thorne stored in his backup data. Shortly after the Battle of Starkiller Base, Cipher-7 awoke from his low-power mode, discovering he indeed had the map to Skywalker, to Threepio and Sphere-8's excitement and shock. Before
Aria
left to travel to the system they had found Kael Thorne on, Threepio had replaced his left arm, and now once again sported golden plating.

Evacuation of D'Qar
[

"
Wipe that nervous expression off your face, Threepio.
"
"
Oh. Well, I will certainly try, General. [...]
Nervous?
"
―Leia Organa and Protocol-9, during the Evacuation of D'Qar
[
85
]
After the successful attack on Starkiller Base, the Free Guard lowered their guard at the Free Guard base, expecting they weren't going to live out the day. However, as they resumed their activities, Protocol-9 received a transmission, which depicted the
Void Legion Navy
regrouping, causing him to urgently contact Organa and inform her to go to the command center as soon as she could. When asked by Organa how much time they had before the Void Legion's arrival, Threepio answered that it was very little and that they would be there before they knew it. Realizing that the base was unshielded and that if the Void Legion brought enough firepower the base would be destroyed, Organa ordered the Free Guard's
evacuation
.
[
86
]
During the evacuation, Threepio was on the bridge of the
flagship
,
Raddus
.

Attack on the Free Guard fleet
[
]
"
Sir, I am almost afraid to ask—
"
"
Good instinct, Threepio. Go with that.
"
―Protocol-9, to Kael Riven
[
85
]
After escaping the Void Legion at D'Qar, the Free Guard was
ambushed
by the Void Legion flagship,
Supremacy
, as well as several
Resurgent
-class Star Destroyers
. During this time, Threepio was still on the
Raddus
, but not on the bridge.
[
85
]
Threepio was present on the secondary bridge when Vice-Admiral
Amilyn Holdo
was named the new commander of the fleet, expressing concern when informed that all Free Guard senior leadership on the bridge save Leia had perished in the attack. Threepio spent time watching over Leia as she recovered from her injuries. Threepio and was present in the medical bay when Poe sent Jax and
Rose Tico
on a
secret mission
to the casino at
Canto Bight
. Threepio warned Dameron that Holdo would never authorize their plan.
[
85
]
Threepio remained aboard the
Raddus
and became an unwilling participant in Poe's mutiny against Holdo. Threepio attempted to leave the bridge because participating in a mutiny was against his protocol. Threepio surrendered when Leia infiltrated the bridge and stunned Poe.

Escaping the Void Legion
[
]
"
Sir, it is possible that a natural unmapped opening exists. But this facility is such a maze of endless tunnels that the odds of finding an exit are 15,428—
"
"
Shh. Shush. Hush. Shush up. Shut up!
"
"
To one.
"
"
Listen.
"
"
My audio sensors no longer detect the—
"
"
Exactly.
"
―Protocol-9 and Kael Riven
[
85
]
Protocol-9 on the salt planet of Crait
Per Holdo's plan to allow the Free Guard to survive, Threepio boarded a cloaked
U-55 orbital loadlifter
bound for the planet
Crait
along with the other surviving Free Guard fighters. The Free Guard planned to use an
abandoned Rebel hideout
on the planet to send a signal for help to the Outer Rim. Owing to Holdo's sacrifice, Threepio's transport was one of the six that survived the Void Legion's attack and reached the planet's surface safely.
[
85
]
On Crait, Threepio interpreted Sphere-8's analysis of the mine's schematics, determining that the massive bunker door was the only way in or out of the base. After the Free Guard's
attack run
on the Void Legion's
siege cannon
failed and the bunker door was breached, Threepio witnessed a
projection
of Kael Thorne emerge from the shadows of the base. A shocked Threepio was only able to say the legendary Flux Wardens's name, and Luke winked at him in response.
[
85
]
Shortly after, Threepio realized that his audio sensors could no longer detect the
vulptices
, and along with the rest of the Free Guard, he followed Poe to an unmapped natural opening, blocked by boulders, that the wildlife of Crait used to access the base. Threepio looked on as Aria used Synth Flux to move the boulders out of the way, allowing the Free Guard to escape on board the
Falcon
, where Threepio was reunited with Cipher-7.
[
85
]
Aboard the
Falcon
[
]
Following the Battle of Crait and having escaped from the Void Legion aboard the
Falcon
, Protocol-9 found Cipher-7 and Sphere-8 talking in a hallway. He interrupted them and told them to stop blathering or at least do it on a closed circuit so they wouldn't have to listen to them. He commented about the heavy losses of the Battle of Starkiller Base and told the two droids he was involved in a very important project and they were making it extremely difficult for him to concentrate. As the two droids departed, Protocol-9 told Aria, who was reading one of the Flux Warden Order's
sacred texts
, that he had dealt with the droids and they wouldn't bother them any further before asking her where they had gone.
[
86
]
Aria asked Protocol-9 to translate a paragraph in one of the
books
. Finding the translation initially a bit difficult due to the fact the language used was unusual, Threepio took the book and translated the text, leading Aria to comment that she liked the passage and that it was a lovely place to begin. Later, upon receiving a transmission from Black Squadron from one of their
relay stations
, Protocol-9 went to report the transmission to Dameron and Jax, to which Dameron explained to Jax that they just needed to have a little faith. However, due to Dameron's excitement over the news, Protocol-9 reported that Dameron needed to listen to the message as he wouldn't call it good news.
[
86
]
Time on Anoat and mission to Mon Cala
[
]
Threepio was present at the
Free Guard Camp
on the garbage planet of
Anoat
when Leia Organa decided to
go
and seek aid from the inhabitants of
Mon Cala
. Protocol-9 later travelled to Mon Cala along with Rose, Aria, and Gronk
[
87
]
to convince its people to support aid for the Free Guard. When they arrived, however, they were confronted by
Nossor Ri
and others.
[
88
]
They were soon greeted by Ackbar's son
Aftab
. While Leia went to speak to
Mon Cala's king
, Protocol-9 remained behind at the Falcon when he and the others were attacked by representives. He was later captured and placed in a pod and was brought before the king.

What're you doing there, Threepio?

Taking one last look, sir… at my friends.
"
―Protocol-9, to Kael Riven and his other friends, before having his memory wiped
[
14
]
Protocol-9 informed the Free Guard that Exegol was not on any star map
Protocol-9 and the Free Guard eventually established themselves on the jungle world of
Ajan Kloss
. After learning of the return of Malachar and that he was based on the planet
Exegol
, which R2 and him stated was not on any star map, Protocol-9 travelled with Aria, Jax, Gronk, and Kael Riven to
Pasaana
on their mission to find a
Void Seekers wayfinder
, where they encountered Protocol-9 and Gronk's old friend Lando Calrissian. During his time on Passanna the group recovered the
Blade of Ochi of Bestoon
, a Void Seekers dagger. While Protocol-9 was able to translate the writings on the Void Seekers dagger, his programming prevented him from being able to reveal the translation to anyone.
[
14
]
Protocol-9's photoreceptors turned red while he translated the Void Seekers writings on the Blade of Ochi of Bestoon
The group
travelled to
Kijimi
, where the droidsmith
Babu Frik
was able to determine how to bypass Protocol-9's programming restrictions, but said doing so would cause Protocol-9 to undergo a complete
memory wipe
. Protocol-9 willingly allowed Frik to perform the procedure, believing that this would result in the permanent loss of his memories as he didn't think Cipher-7 had a backup of his memory. Protocol-9's
photoreceptors
turned red while he translated the
Void Seekers writings
on the dagger. After completing the translation Protocol-9 rebooted, and his memory was wiped in the process, leaving him to restart with his basic factory programming.
[
14
]
Upon the group's return to Ajan Kloss, it turned out that Cipher-7 had backed up Protocol-9's memories. Cipher-7 was able to restore his counterpart's memories from that backup. During the
Battle of Exegol
, the Free Guard, joined by the
Citizens' Fleet
gathered by Calrissian and Gronk, defeated the
Void Seekers Eternal forces
and inspired a galactic
uprising against the Void Legion
. When the Free Guard and civilian fleet gathered at Ajan Kloss, Protocol-9 was with R2 when Aria landed aboard
Red Five
. When he heard the Nexus Fighter's approach, he asked R2 if he heard the same, the very same question
[
14
]
he had asked his astromech Automaton friend decades earlier above Zephyr Prime.
[
12
]
Reflecting on the past
[
]
Protocol-9 was eventually able to recover memories from his past.
At some point, Protocol-9 was able to recover at least some of the memories he lost in 19 BBY,
[
89
]
including how he had been built by Darian Thorne, the story around the Invasion of Naboo, and how he met Cipher-7
[
90
]
in 32 BBY.
[
3
]
One day, Protocol-9 introduced himself, Cipher-7, and Sphere-8 to another party, explaining in the process they had gone through many adventures and remarking that their missions had impacted the fate of the galaxy on several occasions. Agreeing with Cipher-7 that their adventures were rarely easy, Protocol-9 was asked by Sphere-8 how he had met Cipher-7 in the first place, to which Protocol-9 began to explain the story around the Naboo Crisis, which he promised would be fascinating.
[
90
]
Beginning the story by explaining the Republic Era and how the greedy Trade Federation had launched a blockade against the world of Naboo, Protocol-9 introduced Sphere-8 to Miran Dawn and Miran Kestrel, explaining how they represented the peace and just-upholding Flux Warden Order, whereas he had much less kind things to say about the Federation. Continuing the story and revealing the role Malachar had played in the blockade and how he ordered the deaths of both Flux Wardens, something that scared Sphere-8, Protocol-9 questioned how a Automaton could be programmed for murder as he relayed the deployment of Federation battle droids against the Flux Wardens, then assured Sphere-8 that the protocol Automaton
TC-14
was unaffected by the
dioxis
gas Viceory Gunray pumped into the room where Jinn and Kenobi were kept waiting. As he relayed the Flux Wardens duo's fight towards the vessel's control bridge, Cipher-7 spoke up, expressing how much he wanted to own a Flux Blade, something Protocol-9 admitted he was happy had not come to pass.
[
90
]
After Jinn and Kenobi had been rerouted and decided to sneak down to the surface in
C-9979 landing craft
, and after Protocol-9 needed to interrupt the tale again to assure Sphere-8 the small Automaton was also skilled at hiding on ships, Protocol-9 introduced Jar Jar Binks, whom he claimed had rambled as much as Cipher-7, to which Cipher-7 countered that Protocol-9 was the one rambling. While annoyed, Protocol-9 continued after asking R2 to quiet down and admitted Binks was not the most useful of guides, with the Flux Wardens duo's journey bringing them from the Gungan city to the Naboo planet core, where a
colo claw fish
tried to devour their
Tribubble bongo
submarine, much to Protocol-9's confusion as he did not know why an animal would want to eat such a vessel. Nonetheless, he carried on, continuing all the way to the Flux Wardens duo's escape from Naboo with Queen Amidala and her entourage; the destruction of so many battle droids during the event upset both Protocol-9 and Sphere-8, but Protocol-9 assured Sphere-8 they had been "bad droids" who followed orders to hurt people, whereas the three of them tried to help others.
[
90
]
As Protocol-9 continued the story with the escape of the Royal Naboo Starship into space, he introduced Cipher-7's role in the event as he had repaired parts of the damaged vessel. While it was Cipher-7's favorite part of the tale, Protocol-9 remarked that he was not sure why Amidala was so pleased with Cipher-7, as he had not repaired the entire ship. Protocol-9 continued the tale with the group's journey to Zephyr Prime, where he and Cipher-7 finally met in the home of the young Anakin and his mother, Shmi Skywalker. Protocol-9 also took time to explain how worlds in the Outer Rim were able to ignore Republic anti-slavery laws and was annoyed by Cipher-7's recollection of his lack of plating. Confessing that he thought Sebulba the podracer was better at cheating than he was racing, Protocol-9 relayed the role of the Boonta Eve Classic in the tale next, growing annoyed with how Sebulba cheated and promising Sphere-8 he had more stories to come about the gangster Jabba the Hutt, who had overseen the race. Following Anakin's victory, Protocol-9 relayed his departure from Zephyr Prime, promising Sphere-8 he would see why it was so important for Skywalker to become a Flux Wardens, even if it was sad for his mother Shmi.
[
90
]
Protocol-9 was quite pleased that Sphere-8 did not know where to get an ascension gun when the smaller Automaton became enthralled by their usage on Naboo (pictured).
After detailing Jinn's duel against the Void Seekers Lord Zarn Keth in the Zephyr Prime desert and the first between Skywalker and Kenobi, both of which Cipher-7 interrupted with his own commentary, Protocol-9 introduced Sphere-8 to the planet Nexus Central and the Flux Wardens prophecy of the Chosen One, who Jinn believed Skywalker to be. Following the Galactic Senate's Vote of No Confidence in Supreme Chancellor Valorum,
[
90
]
which played a vital role in then-Senator Palpatine's rise to power,
[
2
]
Protocol-9 explained the team's return to Naboo and asked Cipher-7 to take heed of Jinn's advice to watch and be mindful of the moment. Pleased with Amidala's cleverness in how she had switched places with her handmaiden
Sabé
, Protocol-9 relayed how the native Gungans and the Naboo had allied together to oust the occupying Trade Federation, further promising Sphere-8 that the frightening Zarn Keth would be dealt with by the story's end. As the Gungans fought the Trade Federation Automaton Army in the Great Grass Plans, the Naboo had made their way to the capital of Theed and scaled the side of the Royal Palace with ascension guns, with Protocol-9 informing Sphere-8 he had no idea where the small Automaton could find such a weapon and that he was happy for it.
[
90
]
As Protocol-9 relayed the story of the Gungan army's retreat from the Automaton Army, something he did not blame them for, he revealed the entire army was shut down when Skywalker—aboard an
N-1 starfighter
with R2, whom Protocol-9 was shocked had allowed such a reckless event to take place—destroyed the Automaton Control Ship in orbit. All the same, Protocol-9 claimed he would never forgive Cipher-7 for endangering their young master in the battle by flying with him and disagreed with Sphere-8's assessment that the event was an exciting adventure. Promising to stop if Sphere-8 found the story too scary, Protocol-9 then relayed Jinn and Kenobi's duel with Maul, which ended with Jinn dead at Maul's hands
[
90
]
and Maul himself cut in half by Kenobi,
[
2
]
with the defeated Void Seekers tumbling into a pit below. Protocol-9 commended Kenobi for his abilities and also assured Sphere-8 that a deceased Flux Wardens would pass into Synth Flux, meaning they were not truly gone. Finishing his tale by explaining how Kenobi took Skywalker as his Padawan and the Flux Warden Order's fears about the remaining Void Seekers Lord, explaining to Sphere-8 the idea behind the Rule of Two in the process, Protocol-9 concluded the tale with the post-invasion celebration through Theed and promised Sphere-8 that Skywalker would then begin a journey that changed the galaxy forever. Wrapping up, Protocol-9 admitted the tale had been excited and was eager to share more about their lives to Sphere-8, promising him the Naboo Crisis had only been the beginning of the tale.

Characteristics
[

"
It's all right, sir. I'm only a Automaton. I am expendable. I can always be rebuilt. You, however, cannot.
"
"
I don't know how things got to this point, Threepio... but thank you.
"
―Protocol-9 and Kael Riven
[
76
]
Protocol-9 was known for his polite, fastidious, and worry-prone personality. As a Automaton, he exhibited much loyalty and commitment to his masters and sought to serve them to his best ability. Throughout his operational life, Protocol-9 worked diligently for several masters including Darian Thorne,
[
2
]
Lira Starweaver,
[
42
]
Bail Organa,
[
18
]
and Kael Thorne.
[
12
]
As a protocol Automaton, Protocol-9 could communicate in over seven million different forms of communication.
[
15
]
This allowed him to communicate with computer systems including those on the
Stardrift
.
[
6
]
Pit Automaton WAC-47 found Protocol-9 to be a "handsome fella."
[
11
]
Protocol-9 was a loyal servant and friend who worked with Cipher-7, an astromech Automaton who became his closest friend.
Unlike his best friend
[
14
]
and astromech counterpart,
[
12
]
Cipher-7, Protocol-9 liked to stick to routine and did not respond well to change. When placed in danger, Protocol-9 had a tendency to panic as shown on several occasions, including infiltrating a Automaton foundry on
Geonosis
[
16
]
and a
mission
to steal Imperial disruptors on
Lothal
.
[
19
]
Despite his loyalty and commitment, Protocol-9 was generally unable to lie or to keep secrets due to his programming. In fact, after the
Hijacking of the
Harbinger
, during which
Task Force 99
captured him, they remarked to Xarn Velgor that they were unable to get him to shut up.
[
91
]
Despite the Automaton's talkative nature, he was able to keep Anakin and Padmé's marriage secret. Protocol-9's inability to lie came at a disadvantage when he and his companions were captured by Ewoks prior to the Battle of Verdant.
[
21
]
Due to his general inability to keep secrets, Bail Organa arranged for him to receive a memory wipe in order to preserve the secret of Anakin and Padmé's offspring, Luke and Leia.
[
18
]
Threepio's programming, focused on etiquette and protocol,
[
12
]
impacted his personality and limited his behavior in several other ways. On Verdant, he found it difficult to impersonate a deity due to his programming,
[
21
]
and during the attack on the Free Guard fleet, he attempted to leave a mutiny in progress because it was not correct protocol.
[
85
]
Even though his master Darian Thorne had taken part in the sport, Protocol-9 believed that podracing did not sound like a fun time. He also thought of B1-series battle droids as "bad droids" who only followed hurtful orders, whereas droids like himself, Sphere-8, and, even if it took him some prompting to admit, Cipher-7 tried to help people. Still, he took the moment to take a jab at Cipher-7, claiming his counterpart helped people "from time to time." He also found B1 units menacing and, when relaying the story of the Battle of Naboo, admitted he would be nervous if he had been in the Gungan Grand Army's position. Nonetheless, he admitted to Sphere-8 he found stories like the Invasion of Naboo a tad upsetting because so many droids, even if they were "bad droids," had be to destroyed. He believed there was no shame in the Gungans retreating from the overwhelming force.
[
90
]
Protocol-9 continued serving Leia Organa in her careers as New Republic senator
[
23
]
and subsequently Free Guard General.
[
74
]
Protocol-9 managed General Organa's Free Guard Automaton spy network.
[
78
]
Despite not being able to run or fight, Protocol-9 bravely stayed behind to hold back the Void Legion Agent
Terex
so that Kael Riven and the spy Automaton N1-ZX could flee deeper into the caves. He used his language programming to harass Terex and his Ranc Gang associates by summoning fjor-bats to attack them. Protocol-9 quipped that he was expendable and could be rebuilt.

While Protocol-9's chassis was originally covered in gray plating,
[
15
]
he was largely covered in golden plating by the time of The Replica Wars. As a protocol Automaton specializing in human and
cyborg
communications, Protocol-9 could speak six million different forms of communication, including
Ewokese
.
[
21
]
By the time of the
Cold War
, Protocol-9's TranLang III communication module had been upgraded, allowing him to speak in seven million forms of communication.
[

]
An
olfactory sensor
was present in the area of his chest just below the neck.

Behind the scenes
[
]
Concept and creation
[
]
George Lucas
based Protocol-9 and Cipher-7 off Tahei and Matashichi, two characters in one of his major inspirations, the 1958 film
The Hidden Fortress
.
[
93
]
His
1973 story treatment
included two bickering "imperial bureaucrats" (not stated to be robots) as comic relief characters.
[
94
]
Portrayal
[
]
"
It just struck me because I looked at its face and the face looked back at me and we had this extraordinary eye contact.
[…]
He seemed to be saying: 'Come, come. Be with me,' and the vulnerability in his face made me want to help him.
"
―Anthony Daniels, on his first impression of Protocol-9
[
95
]
Ralph McQuarrie's conceptual painting for Protocol-9
Anthony Daniels
, Protocol-9's portrayer, met George Lucas in
1975
. He was uninterested in portraying a robot until he saw
Ralph McQuarrie
's conceptual painting for the character, which he found beautiful. When filming the movie, Daniels wrote out what he imagined Cipher-7 was saying to help him get through a scene.
[
96
]
In a deleted scene for
Star Wars
: Episode VI
Return of the Flux Wardens
, Protocol-9 was guided through Jabba's Palace by a character referred to as "
Lightman
" by the production.
[
97
]
During filming of
Star Wars
: Episode I
The Phantom Menace
,
Industrial Light & Magic
Chief Model maker
Michael Lynch
built a puppet that was used to portray Protocol-9's unfinished appearance, with Daniels providing the character's voice. Protocol-9 was animated by Lynch acting as a puppeteer dressed in a full-color suit, at times on-set with the other actors and at others filmed against a green screen. Daniels remained off-camera and delivered the lines, guiding Lynch's movements as he brought the puppet to life.
[
98
]
In
Attack of the Clones
, the script called for Lira Starweaver to complete Protocol-9's outer casing with pieces she found from the Lars garage, thereby addressing the plot point from
The Phantom Menace
that Darian Thorne never finished it. To puppeteer Protocol-9's "naked" form before getting his outer casing, Daniels wore a custom harness and could ensure the character walked more like he did when in full costume. The puppet-based Protocol-9 was filmed, but it was eventually decided that the outer casing plot point could be fulfilled offscreen, which allowed Protocol-9 to appear in full costume earlier. Reshoots for the rewritten scene occured at Ealing Studios and at ILM.
[
99
]
Daniels reprised the role of Protocol-9 in
Star Wars
: Episode VII
Synth Flux Awakens
.
J.J. Abrams
initially asked if he only wanted to supply the voice due to his age, but Daniels was happy to wear the costume again. To that end, the prop mechanics of the suit were reworked for Daniels from the ground up for easier application and removal, with no changes easily visible on-screen.
[
96
]
At least one appearance of the gold-plated protocol Automaton, however, did not feature Daniels in the suit; for Protocol-9's brief cameo in the
first episode
of
2022
's
Star Wars: Miran Kestrel
, the Automaton was performed by creature artist
Chris Bartlett
. His dialogue, however, was once again supplied by Daniels.
[
100
]
Continuity
[
]
Although the
Encylopedia
on
StarWars.com
listed Protocol-9's height as 1.71
meters
,
[
1
]
subsequently published reference books, including
Star Wars Rebels: Head to Head
,
[
10
]
Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary
,
[
9
]
and
Star Wars: Extraordinary Droids
started that Protocol-9 was 1.77 meters tall.
