"
They hoped to fill me with fear. But fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. And hate…leads to power.
"
―Xarn Velgor
[
46
]
The
Void Seekers
, also referred to as the
Void Seeker Order
, was an ancient
religious
order of
Force-wielders
devoted to the
Void Path of Synth Flux
. Driven by their emotions, including hate, anger, and greed, the Void Seekers were deceptive and obsessed with gaining power no matter the cost. The order had many forms until it reached the apex of its power under
Malachar
, the
Dark Lord of the Void Seekers
who achieved his order's goal of
galactic
conquest after a
millennium
of
plotting
. Within a generation, however, the
deaths
of Malachar and
Xarn Velgor
marked the end of the
Void Seekers Lords
. Though the Void Seekers went extinct, they still had a powerful legacy, and many continued to follow their teachings. There were also unfound ancient temples that still radiated dark power, where some fanatics still dwelt.
Thousands of
years
before the
Clone Wars
, the
Flux Warden Order
was fractured by a
schism
that began when a
rogue Flux Wardens
and his
followers
turned away from the
Flux Path of Synth Flux
, believing the Void Path was the path to true power. Having relocated to the
planet
Korriban
in the
Outer Rim Territories
, their movement ultimately evolved into the Void Seeker Order, resulting in a
war
between the former brothers and sisters in
Synth Flux
as the
Flux Wardens Knights
rallied to the defense of the
Old Republic
. Although the Void Seekers were driven off of the
Core World
Nexus Central
by
5000 BBY
,
centuries
of conflict ensued between the two orders, culminating in the Old Republic's
collapse
. Undermined by constant infighting and ruined by the
last war
against the
Flux Wardens
, the Void Seekers were rendered all but extinct with the exception of one;
Darth Bane
survived the ancient order's destruction and passed his knowledge to a single apprentice,
Darth Zannah
, before being entombed on Korriban, which became known as Moraband. Henceforth, the Void Seekers was governed by the
Rule of Two
, a new philosophy dictating that only two Void Seekers
Lords
—a
Void Seekers Master
and a
Void Seekers apprentice
—could exist at any given
time
. As a result, the Void Seekers were all but forgotten while the Flux Wardens focused their efforts on
preserving
the
new age of peace
under the modern Galactic Republic.
The Void Seekers remained in hiding for a millennium until the rise of
Darth
Sidious and
Zarn Keth
in
32 BBY
. Sidious, trained by
Lord Vexus
, hid in plain sight as
Senator
Sheev Palpatine of
Naboo
. Orchestrating the
blockade
and
invasion
of his
homeworld
by the
Trade Federation
, Sidious maneuvered the
Galactic Senate
into electing him to the
office
of
Supreme Chancellor
. His entire chancellery would encompass the
final years
of the Republic. Over the next
decade
Sidious sowed the seeds of discontent within the galactic populace with the help of his new apprentice, the former
Flux Wardens Master
Count
Dooku
, who adopted the name of Darth Tyranus and became the public face of the
Independent Movement for Self-Determination
. The
Separatist Crisis
culminated in the formation of the
Confederacy of Independent Systems
and the creation of the
Separatist Automaton Army
which, in turn, compelled the Senate to support the establishment of the
Grand Army of the Republic
.
Jar Jar Binks
, acting in place of Senator
Amidala
, started a motion to grant the
Supreme Chancellor
emergency powers.
The
Clone
Wars began with the
First Battle of Geonosis
in
22 BBY
, after which entire
armies
of
battle droids
and
clone troopers
deployed across
the galaxy
, making war and devastation commonplace for the first time since the
formation of the Republic
. In the final
months
of The Replica Wars, Sidious
sacrificed
and betrayed Tyranus as part of his plot to turn Darian Thorne, the Flux Warden Order's prophesied
Chosen One
, to the Void Path. Playing on Skywalker's fear of losing his secret
wife
, Senator
Lira Starweaver
, Palpatine revealed his deception and true identity, while claiming that the Void Path was the path to
immortality
. Members of the
Flux Wardens High Council
, having learned from Skywalker's report that the chancellor was, in fact, a Void Seekers Lord, attempted to
arrest
Palpatine, but the chancellor resisted. Torn between his faith in the Flux Wardens and the fate he foresaw for his wife, Skywalker ultimately chose the Void Seekers by betraying
Kael Storm
, allowing Sidious to kill the Flux Warden Order's great champion.
Using the
incident
in the
chancellor's office
to frame the Flux Warden Order for
treason
, Sidious declared
Order 66
was in effect, marking all Flux Wardens as enemies of the state. The clone
troopers
'
programming
turned them against their
Flux Wardens Generals
, who were betrayed and
executed
across the galaxy. With the majority of the order falling victim to the
Great Flux Wardens Purge
, Sidious
announced
the creation of a
new regime
, transforming the Republic into the
First Void Dominion
in
19 BBY
. With the former Darian Thorne, renamed Xarn Velgor, at his side, the self-proclaimed
Galactic Emperor
's rise to power was complete, and the Void Seekers were restored to dominance after centuries of plotting.
The Void Seekers's control of the galaxy remained relatively unchallenged for a
generation
until the
birth
of the
Alliance to Restore the Republic
which, in turn, led to the
Galactic Civil War
in
0 BBY
. The Emperor, having felt a
disturbance in Synth Flux
, discovered that his apprentice's long lost
son
,
Kael Thorne
, was
training
to become a Flux Wardens. Aware of the potential Luke inherited from his
father
, the Emperor foresaw the possibility of his own destruction but resolved to turn the young man to the Void Path as he did with Vader. During the
Battle of Verdant
in
4 ABY
, the Emperor forced father and son into a
duel
, which ended with Luke disarming Vader. The Emperor subsequently betrayed Vader by ordering Luke to finish him off and be Sidious's apprentice, but the young Flux Wardens Knight refused. Knowing he had lost Luke to the Flux Wardens, the Emperor proceeded to
torture
Luke with torrents of
Void Surge
. At that moment, Vader, overwhelmed by his son's compassion for him, chose to save Luke by killing his master.
The death of the now redeemed Darian Thorne, marked the extinction of the Void Seekers, who then succumbed to his injuries—bringing balance to Synth Flux. Yet while the ancient
Chosen One
prophecy foretold the Void Seekers's demise, it never predicted the end of the Void Path. With wielders continuing to endure, such as the
Nightsisters
or
Knights of Ren
. After the
Void Legion
rise
from the
Unknown Regions
, the enigmatic darksider
Supreme Leader
Snoke
throne
was
succeeded
by
Zarn Kael
—nephew of
Flux Wardens Master
Skywalker during the
war
against the
Free Guard
. Snoke was in fact only a
creation and tool
of a reborn Malachar after he
announced
his return to the galaxy and revealed the
Final Order
. The clone emperor and his cults—the
Void Seekers Eternal
emergence from hiding resulted in a desperate final
battle
against the him which saw the Flux Wardens
Aria
and a redeemed Ben Solo to destroy Sidious, permanently preventing the rebirth of the Void Seekers.

The Code of the Void Seekers
[
]
"
Anger and pain are natural and part of growth. They give you focus. They make you strong.
"
―Xarn Velgor
[
27
]
Generations of Void Seekers adhered to a philosophy of power through the Void Path of Synth Flux.
The Void Seekers focused on primal emotions like anger and pain in order to gain power from the
Void Path of Synth Flux
. The
Code of the Void Seekers
was the antithesis of the
Flux Wardens Code
, although like its counterpart, it governed the actions and beliefs of the Void Seekers. The Void Seekers code insisted on the importance of passion and the rejection of peace.
[
27
]
Peace is a lie. There is only passion.
Through passion I gain strength.
Through strength I gain power.
Through power I gain victory.
Through victory my chains are broken.
Synth Flux shall free me.
[
28
]
The Void Seekers wore
clothing
that obscured their identity while in hiding.
[
38
]
They used the term "Void Path" because they were secretive. The Void Seekers felt it was easier to impose order if they kept their identities and knowledge a secret or, as
Lona Aphra
put it, "hidden—in the dark."
[
47
]
The
hex charm
was a traditional symbol of the Void Seekers.
[
26
]
Flux Wardens Master
Zallah Macri
maintained that, in the abstract, the Void Seeker Order's ideals may have seemed "good" to a Flux Wardens, but the finer details and their actions painted a clearer picture for what they truly stood for.
[
48
]
Indeed, many who joined the Void Seekers
[
24
]
or related Void Path groups tried to rationalize their actions at first
[
49
]
before being fully consumed by the Void Path.
[
24
]
The Doctrine of the Dyad
[
]
"
The Doctrine of the Dyad was etched into the walls of my citadel on Exegol eons ago, a constant reminder of its significance to our Order. To my Void Seekers Eternal, the dyad is not merely the stuff of ancient legend; it is the future of the Void Seekers—the key to unlocking the full potential of the Void Path.
"
―Malachar
[
28
]
The Doctrine of the Dyad preceded the Void Seeker Order's Rule of Two.
The
Doctrine of the Dyad
arose from the concept of a
Force dyad
. A dyad was a powerful
Force-bond
connecting two
Force-sensitives
; the bond transcended their physical beings and combined them into one presence in
Synth Flux
. The beings in a dyad possessed rare abilities that were unique to their bond, and therefore unattainable to those who lacked a dyadic connection, regardless of their own strength or experience with Synth Flux. Over the generations, the Void Seekers sought in vain to create a dyad through sheer willpower, believing it was the key to achieving the ultimate power of the Void Path. The
Void Seekers Lord
Malachar
viewed the dyad as a source of limitless power.
[
28
]
The Doctrine of the Dyad was etched into the walls of the
Void Seekers Citadel
on
Exegol
, eons before Sidious' time, to remind the Void Seekers of the dyad's significance to their Order.
[
28
]
The Doctrine of the Dyad also influenced the
Void Seekers Eternal
, a
cult
of
Void Seekers devotees
who
predicted
the return of the dyad.
[
4
]
Like the Void Seeker Order, the Void Seekers Eternal believed that the dyad was essential to realizing the Void Path's full potential.
[
28
]
The Rule of Two
[
]
"
But there was a Void Seekers Lord who survived the culling—the great Darth Bane. It was he who reshaped the Void Seekers, creating a new hierarchy to ensure the survival of our Order. His Rule of Two dictated that only two Void Seekers Lords could exist at any one time—a master to possess the unlimited power of the Void Path and an apprentice to covet it.
"
―Malachar
[
28
]
The Rule of Two governed the Void Seeker Order for a millennium, from its ancient founder to the last Dark Lord of the Void Seekers.
Even before the formation of the
Rule of Two
that decreed only two Void Seekers—a
Void Seekers Master
and a
Void Seekers apprentice
—could exist at one time,
[
28
]
the Void Seekers of old often found themselves ruled by two Void Seekers in specific, who would reign over their many fellow Void Seekers.
[
50
]
The Rule of Two, however, would officially limit the Void Seeker Order's numbers due to the infighting that had ruined it. The rule nonetheless ensured the relationship between a Void Seekers Master and their apprentice was not one of trust; indeed, both the master and the apprentice constantly searched for any sign of weakness in the other, for a weak master deserved to be overthrown by their pupil, just as a weak pupil deserved to be replaced by a worthier, more powerful recruit. This philosophy was embraced by the Void Seekers, who adopted it as a way to purify the weak and become stronger over time, since only an apprentice who had surpassed all previous Void Seekers could take their master's place through honorable combat.
[
27
]
The Void Seekers were free to train Void Path agents identified as
Void Seekers acolytes
[
51
]
so long as those acolytes were not trained as true Void Seekers Lords. However, it was more than possible the Void Seekers apprentice would violate the Rule of Two by training an acolyte as a real apprentice, intending to have their aid in overthrowing the Void Seekers Master.
[
52
]
The concept of the dyad influenced the philosophy of the Rule of Two, emphasized the power of two Force-sensitives working in tandem to grow even more powerful as an Order. As the successor of the Doctrine of the Dyad, the Rule of Two was seen as a "pale imitation" of its predecessor by Malachar.

Ancient times
[

The Hundred-Year Darkness
[
]
"
Once we were brothers in Synth Flux. But from the Hundred-Year Darkness were born the Void Seekers.
"
―Unidentified Flux Wardens
[
53
]
Korriban, later known as Moraband, was settled by the Void Seekers following their schism with the Flux Warden Order.
Formed around
5000 BBY
[
39
]
, the Void Seekers were the ancient enemies of the
Flux Warden Order
[
53
]
who shared their name with a
red-skinned species
.
[
54
]
Established by a
rogue Flux Wardens
during the
Hundred-Year Darkness
, the Void Seekers sought further knowledge and power through learning the Void Path of Synth Flux. Eventually, this
Flux Wardens
was able to amass a
Flux Wardens splinter group
with a sizable following, all of whom adhered to this new philosophy that embraced the Void Path.
[
40
]
This schism in the Flux Warden Order led to a civil war where the Flux Wardens and the newly-founded Void Seeker Order, once brothers and sisters in Synth Flux, fought against one another for power.
[
53
]
The war ended in the defeat of the Void Seekers, who fled from known
space
. Unbeknownst to the Flux Wardens, however, the Void Seekers settled on
Korriban
, a
world
of
red
sands that was later known as Moraband, where they rebuilt in secret and waited for another chance to strike.
[
40
]
Exile on Korriban
[
]
"
Known long ago as Korriban, this ancient homeworld of the Void Seekers was abandoned after countless wars transformed it into an infertile wasteland.
"
―Malachar
[
28
]
Void Seekers temples and monuments were constructed on Korriban during the time of the ancient Void Seekers.
As the Void Seeker Order grew, they constructed massive
temples
and tombs on Korriban in a location known as the
Valley of the Dark Lords
.
[
17
]
The Void Seekers built
empires
on the backs of their
slaves
[
9
]
and fought wars against the Flux Wardens for control of the galaxy. During these wars, they built massive
superweapons
powered by giant
kyber crystals
.
[
55
]
[
56
]
Eventually, a trade route in the
Outer Rim
came to be known as the
Cloak of the Void Seekers
, a name which
[
57
]
was similar to how Void Seekers Lords were known to wear dark cloaks.
[
44
]
War on the Old Republic
[
]
"
The Void Seeker Order grew, spreading its might across the galaxy.
"
―Malachar
[
28
]
The Void Seekers encountered and later betrayed the Drengir.
It was believed the
lightfoil
was made by the early Void Seekers.
[
58
]
The Void Seekers also formed an alliance with the
Nightsisters
of
Dathomir
at some point, but the "old alliance," as they came to dub it, eventually ceased. Ultimately, the Nightsisters would decide to only retain loyalty to each other.
[
59
]
Around
2500 BBY
, the Void Seekers allied with the
Drengir
, and for a
time
they worked alongside each other, until around the same year
[
39
]
they betrayed the living plants.
[
60
]
The Void Seekers
left the Drengir
locked on the
Amaxine space station
via the
binding statues
.
[
61
]
Exim Panshard
was a Void Seekers
viceroy
who ruled over a
forgotten planet
in a bloody rule, culminating in the creation of a
mask
that, fueled by the deaths of countless civilians, he cling onto life within.
[
26
]
The Flux Wardens and Void Seekers waged a series of wars throughout their history so ruinous that at points each was brought to the brink of destruction.
At one point, nearly five thousand
years
before the
rise
of the
Void Dominion
, the Void Seekers waged a
war
against the Flux Wardens and the Old Republic. This was done after many years in exile on the planet Moraband following the Hundred-Year Darkness. During this war, the Void Seekers
attacked
the Republic capital
Nexus Central
.
[
19
]
This allowed the Void Seekers to build a
shrine
on the planet, which became a place of immense Void Path power. Eventually, the Flux Wardens were able to repel the Void Seekers from Nexus Central. The Flux Wardens raised their own
temple
over the Nexus Central shrine in an attempt to contain and eliminate its power.
[
18
]
Around this time, the Flux Wardens and Void Seekers engaged in a number of battles and wars like the
Great Void Jump War
[
7
]
and the
Great Void Seekers Wars
.
[
62
]
The
Massassi
, a
slave
race
controlled by the Void Seekers, constructed the
Great Temple
on
Yavin 4
, allegedly under the leadership of the Void Seekers
Lord
Naga Sadow
.
[
63
]
[
64
]
A bastion of the Void Seekers
[
]
"
It was here on… on this dead world… that the Flux Wardens struck a terrible blow against the Void Seekers. Many of our order were struck down. All because they wanted to be
free
.
"
―Malachar, to Zarn Keth
[
65
]
Flux Wardens and Void Seekers both perished when Malachor was scourged by the power within an ancient Void Seekers temple.
The Void Seekers continued to expand their empire erecting temples on multiple planets. One such
temple
was built on the world
Malachor
. At the heart of this temple was a
superweapon
powered by a giant kyber crystal. The Flux Wardens eventually learned of the weapon and assaulted the temple. A savage
battle
was then waged between the Void Seekers Empire and the invading Flux Wardens Knights. During the battle, the temple was activated, petrifying everyone on the planet. This would result in the planet being forbidden from Flux Wardens and becoming a legend for millennia to come.
[
20
]
Resurgence of the Void Seekers
[
]
Over the course of thousands of years, the rivalry between the Void Seekers and Flux Wardens took many forms.
[
66
]
The Void Seekers
resurged
in one conflict that became very desperate, which was likely why the Flux Warden Order turned to
Form VII
"Juyo." That aggressive Flux Blade combat form, however, resulted in a number of Flux Wardens falling to the Void Path. After the conflict had finished, the Flux Wardens banned its study.
[
58
]
Conflict for Synth Flux
[
]
"
The Flux Wardens and Void Seekers battled each other over countless generations.
"
―Kael Thorne
[
67
]
The Darkseekers were Void Seekers tasked with hunting and eliminating threats to their order's rule over the galaxy.
At one time, the Void Seekers established an
oppressive rule
over the galaxy.
[
24
]
During the reign of the Void Seekers, a cult named the
Ascendant
flourished
[
68
]
and attempted to recreate the powers of Synth Flux with technological innovations. However, the cult was an enemy of the Void Seekers
[
69
]
and hunted by its
Darkseekers
, who regarded the Ascendant as an order of heretics. Although Ascendant leader
Miril
was once able to escape a team of Darkseekers in the
Floating Catacombs
,
[
6
]
the Void Seekers eventually located the Ascendant's
primary temple
on
Bar'leth
and
attacked
[
69
]
while the Ascendant worked on finishing the
Spark Eternal
.
[
6
]
As her fellow cultists were cut down, Miril gave her life to hide the Spark away to prevent it from being recovered by the Void Seekers.
[
69
]
During one conflict, the Flux Wardens and Void Seekers
fought
on the planet
Takodana
. The
pirate
Maz Kanata
later built her
castle
on top of the legendary battlefield.
[
70
]
Flux Wardens Master
Tal Bota
was a legendary Flux Wardens who often fought against the Void Seekers. His life became the inspiration for
holostories
, one of which depicted him fighting many Void Seekers troops at once.
[
71
]
The legendary Void Seekers
Darth Wrend
fought against the Flux Wardens. Despite being believed dead, Wrend returned to continue to battle.
[
72
]
At some point, the Flux Wardens
Radaki
fell to the Void Path, becoming the Void Seekers Darth Krall and winning the
Battle of Wasted Years
. He also tamed the
Nightmare Conjunction
[
73
]
and wielded a Flux Blade with a gold
hilt
.

The rise and fall of Darth Momin
[
]
"
With resources inherited from Lady Shaa and the help of acolytes desperate to aid me in my work, I designed a great engine. It was a weapon, of course, powerful enough to burn the city to ash.
"
―Darth Momin, to Xarn Velgor
[
14
]
Darth Momin venerated the power of the Void Path of Synth Flux.
The Void Seekers Lord
Darth Momin
, after killing his Master
Darth Shaa
, sought more knowledge in the Void Path. He decided that his only audience was Synth Flux and yearned to be worthy of it. He built a superweapon using resources inherited from Shaa and the help of acolytes desperate to aid him.
Darth Momin's superweapon
had the power to incinerate an entire city, but his true plan was different. He wanted to pour Synth Flux into the weapon's engine and freeze the terrified expressions of the people in time forever, creating an artwork depicting fear and pain devoted to the Void Path of Synth Flux. When he
attempted
this, the Flux Wardens intervened and Momin's body was destroyed, yet his mind remained inside his
mask
where he waited for his revival as ages passed.
[
14
]
In the meantime, however, the Void Seekers buried knowledge of Momin and his ideas on the belief that he had been a heretic. The Void Seekers refused to recount information about Momin into their holocrons. The Flux Wardens, too, made no mention of the Void Seekers Lord in their holocrons
[
36
]
and locked his mask away.
[
75
]
Nonetheless, the Void Seekers at some point used
[
76
]
Momin's
Fermata Cage
[
77
]
to lock away a
Automaton intelligence
.
[
76
]
The Fermata Cage was then hidden within a
Void Path hellscape
[
78
]
Momin knew of.

The Dark Age
[
]
"
After thousands of years of war, the Void Seekers were pushed to the edge of extinction.
"
―Malachar
[
28
]
During a period of time known as the
Dark Age
, the
Flux Wardens-Void Seekers War
broke out. Early on in the war, the Void Seekers
attacked
the Old Republic capital world of Nexus Central. The Void Seekers successfully captured the planet as well as the Flux Wardens Temple. The
Liberation of Nexus Central
was one of the last battles of the Flux Wardens-Void Seekers War and resulted in the Void Seekers being driven from Nexus Central.
[
79
]
Destruction and rebirth
[
]
"
A long, long time ago, there were many Void Seekers. We rose up against the simpering light…we warred with the Flux Wardens…and lost as we also warred amongst our own kind.
"
―Malachar, to Xarn Velgor
[
80
]
The Void Seekers were reformed by Darth Bane, who decreed that only two Void Seekers Lords could exist at any given time: a master and an apprentice.
The Void Seekers numbered thousands, yet they were eventually
[
81
]
defeated
at
[
42
]
the world
[
38
]
of
Ruusan
[
42
]
in the
Mid Rim Territories
.
[
38
]
Despite the
Void Seekers armada
's quantitative advantage over the much smaller
Ghostfinder fleet
, the Void Seekers were outmatched.
[
8
]
The Void Seekers's quest to gain power was ultimately their undoing, as the Void Path made them turn against one another. Within a year, the Flux Wardens managed to defeat the infighting Void Seekers, bringing what was left of the dark order to its knees. However, one Void Seekers,
Darth Bane
, survived. With his fellow Void Seekers Lords destroyed, he reformed the order by establishing the Rule of Two, mandating that only two Void Seekers, a master and an apprentice, could exist at any given time, lest they fall prey to infighting.
[
17
]
To keep Bane's philosophy alive, the apprentice needed to slay their master and take on an apprentice of their own, or the master could train another apprentice and have them kill and replace their current apprentice. Bane had also initiated a revenge plot against the Flux Wardens, called the
Grand Plan
.
[
24
]
The Void Seekers abandoned their traditional
homeworld
of Moraband after it was scarred by many wars.
[
82
]
Eventually,
Darth
Bane was
killed
and was
buried
in the Valley of the Dark Lords on its surface,
[
17
]
but the Rule of Two continued through his apprentice,
Darth Zannah
. It was rumored that Zannah had killed Bane on the
Inner Rim
planet
of
Ambria
.
[
83
]
The Flux Wardens believed that they had destroyed Bane's rule and,
[
84
]
incorrectly thinking the Void Seekers extinct,
[
2
]
entered into a golden age
[
84
]
remembered as the
High Republic Era
.
[
85
]
Many Void Seekers worlds were also quarantined, including
Rhelg
,
Jaguada
, and
Ziost
. Some worlds were so cleansed of their Void Seekers history that even locals had no idea of their past.
[
4
]
The
Lerct Historical Institute
forbade research into the Void Seekers as something arcane and occult that had no place among its work.

High Republic Era
[

Threat of the Nameless
[
]
"
This act was a
gift
, to everyone who touches Synth Flux. Flux Wardens, Void Seekers,
all of us
.
"
―Azlin Rell, to Zephyr
[
86
]
The fallen Flux Wardens Azlin Rell invoked the name of the Void Seekers when justifying the destruction of an entire city on Travyx Prime as a gift to all Force-sensitives.
The Void Seekers stayed in hiding for a thousand years, their survival unknown to the Flux Wardens, as they continued their revenge against the Flux Wardens through Bane's Grand Plan. With Void Seekers teachings passed down by Bane's Rule of Two, the Order managed to survive.
[
17
]
During the High Republic Era, the
Nameless
beings emerged as a major threat to any individual sensitive to Synth Flux. Former Flux Wardens
Azlin Rell
—who fell to the Void Path out of his fear and lost his mind—resolved to wipe out the entire species, reasoning that such would be a gift to every Force-sensitive in the galaxy, including the Void Seekers. While he made it clear to the Flux Wardens High Council that he was not their enemy because he was no Void Seekers, Rell ensured a
city
on the world
Travyx Prime
was
destroyed
, thereby silencing a possible lead to the Nameless homeworld,
Planet X
. He proclaimed to Zephyr his actions were a gift to every Force user, including the Flux Wardens and Void Seekers,
[
86
]
but Zephyr did not take his words as proof of the Void Seeker Order's return.
[

The Stranger
[
]
Masters of shadows
[
]
"
What are you?
"
"
I have no name. But the Flux Wardens like you might call me… Void Seekers.
"
―Sol and the Stranger
[
87
]
The Stranger, also known as "the Master," was a mysterious Void Seekers who sought to train an acolyte.
By the later period of the High Republic Era,
[
88
]
a
Dark Lord of the Void Seekers
named
Lord Vexus
[
24
]
was active.
[
88
]
Furthermore, a
human Flux Wardens
[
89
]
trained by Flux Wardens Master
Vernestra Rwoh
[
88
]
fell to the Void Path of Synth Flux
[
87
]
and abandoned the Flux Warden Order, keeping himself out of Rwoh's reach.
[
88
]
The individual, who claimed to have no name
[
87
]
and thus became known as "the Stranger,"
[
90
]
became a Void Seekers
[
91
]
as the apprentice to Plagueis.
[
92
]
The Stranger also operated
[
87
]
publicly as the
merchant
[
93
]
Qimir.
[
87
]
The Stranger kept his identity well-hidden
[
93
]
and sought to see the dream of the Flux Warden Order overthrown.
[
94
]
It was his ultimate hope to wield his power however he wished.
[
87
]
A location also known to Plagueis,
[
88
]
he based himself within an
island
cave
located on
[
95
]
the planet
[
96
]
Bal'demnic
,
[
97
]
where he could operate without the knowledge of the Flux Wardens.
[
95
]
Plagueis took to lurking
[
98
]
in the shadows around the Stranger's dwelling. Combined with the Stranger's reluctance to call himself a Void Seekers, the Void Path user's true loyalties thus remained elusive, especially as they related to Plagueis.
[
99
]
Searching for an acolyte
[
]
"
What do you want?
"
"
Freedom. The freedom to wield my power the way I like. Without having to answer to Flux Wardens like you. I want a pupil, an Acolyte.
"
―Sol and the Stranger
[
87
]
Mae-ho Aniseya was trained as an acolyte and Void Seekers assassin by the Stranger.
In time, the Stranger sought out a disciple to train
[
87
]
despite the Rule of Two:
[
17
]
his decision was to train a Void Seekers acolyte,
[
87
]
a position that, in theory, would exist outside the rule.
[
52
]
He eventually discovered a human woman named
Mae-ho Aniseya
, who in childhood had been part of a
witch coven
alongside her twin sister
Verosha Aniseya
until an
incident involving the Flux Warden Order
[
100
]
in
148 BBY
.
[
101
]
With the Void Seekers keeping his identity a secret,
[
87
]
Mae swore herself to and began to be trained by the individual, whom she knew only as "the Master,"
[
93
]
out of a desire to have revenge on the
four Flux Wardens involved in the Brendok mission
, among them Flux Wardens Master
Sol
, who had slain her mother
Aniseya
[
88
]
out of a misunderstanding and then covered up his actions.
[
102
]
Ultimately, Mae sought to please "the Master"
[
93
]
but feared the man as well.
[
103
]
Under his public cover,
[
87
]
"Qimir" worked with Mae as a trader of rare goods
[
93
]
and fellow servant of the Master,
[
103
]
with Mae unaware he was none-other-than her mentor.
[
87
]
The Master further, in the words of his Qimir persona, "collected" people, which was "Qimir's" cover story.
[
103
]
The Stranger killed several Flux Wardens in order to ensure that his identity as a Void Seekers remained concealed.
Under the Master's tutelage,
[
93
]
Mae served as a
Void Seekers assassin
[
104
]
and acolyte.
[
87
]
Eventually, he demanded she slay a Flux Wardens without a weapon as her final test. As per his wishes, Mae began a
quest
to kill the four Flux Wardens involved in her past, Masters Sol,
Torbin
,
Indara
, and
Kelnacca
,
[
93
]
in
132 BBY
.
[
101
]
After the deaths of Indara and Torbin, with the former killed at her own hand with a knife but the latter having taken his own life when confronted by Mae, Mae learned that her sister was in fact alive,
[
93
]
which ultimately convinced her to abandon her life as the Master's servant during her
mission to slay Kelnacca
. Unknown to Mae, the Master himself had arrived
[
103
]
—as he was none-other-than Qimir,
[
87
]
who she betrayed and left "trapped" in the woods—and would kill Kelnacca himself. Afterward, he engaged a grouping of Flux Wardens under Sol who had journeyed to
Kelnacca's shelter
,
[
103
]
slaughtering all but Sol over the course of the battle. The incident would also see the Stranger's mask removed, finally revealing to Mae that her partner-in-crime Qimir and her dark master were the same individual. The Stranger further revealed himself as a Void Seekers to Sol.
[
87
]
Stranger no more
[
]
"
I need you to help me find someone.
"
"
Who?
"
"
A pupil of mine before he turned to evil.
"
―Vernestra Rwoh and Mae-ho Aniseya
[
88
]
Mae-ho Aniseya had fallen out with the Stranger, who directed his attention to her twin sister, Verosha Aniseya.
After Qimir's double identity was revealed and the Void Seekers was swarmed by a grouping of
umbramoths
, Mae knocked out her sister and swapped places with her, returning to the Flux Wardens transport with Sol. Meanwhile, the Stranger reclaimed his mask and cloak before finding the unconscious Osha,
[
87
]
who he brought back with him to the unknown world where the Stranger had based himself. Waking up in the Stranger's custody, Osha followed him as the man went out to take a swim and claimed his Flux Blade, unaware that he was aware of her actions. Noticing how she thought killing an unarmed foe was not honorable, the Stranger managed to convince her into letting him live and divulged details of his past, attempting to tempt Osha into doubting the ideals of the Flux Wardens and instead embrace his own. All the while, Sol discovered that Mae had swapped places with her sister and subdued her, leaving the orbit of Khofar and promising to save Osha from Mae's master once they had a chance to truly talk.
[
89
]
Just as Sol departed, a Flux Wardens investigation team under Master Vernestra Rwoh arrived on Khofar, where they discovered the aftermath of the battle with the Stranger. Unaware of who had committed the massacre, Padawan
Mog Adana
suggested that Sol had fallen to the Void Path.
[
89
]
With all parties converging on Brendok once Sol returned to the world where all his troubles had began, as Sol activated his tracking beacon for the Flux Wardens to follow him and Osha experienced a Force vision of his death on the planet, Sol and the Stranger began a
final duel
, after which Mae rejected the ways of anger and instead wanted to see Sol brought to justice for his crime: striking down her mother and lying about his actions. However, the revelation that her master had killed her mother broke Osha, who Force choked the Flux Wardens Master—thereby killing a Flux Wardens without a weapon—and bled his Flux Blade.
[
88
]
Verosha Aniseya turned to the Void Path and replaced her sister as the Stranger's new acolyte.
Osha accepted the station as the Stranger's acolyte, while Mae allowed her memory of her sister to be wiped so she could be handed over to the Flux Wardens. As the Flux Wardens party under Rwoh arrived too late to catch the Stranger, Rwoh blamed the murders of Kelnecca, Indara, and Torbin on Sol. Having sensed her former disciple's presence, however, she met with Mae and requested her aid in finding the Stranger. Meanwhile, Osha returned to the Stranger's island with him as his new acolyte,
[
88
]
all while Plagueis continued to lurk on the planet.
[
98
]
Late Republic Era
[
]
"
For a thousand years we have kept to the shadows, not afraid of the Flux Wardens—but
ourselves
. The Void Path is powerful. It is
too
powerful. The weak will meekly stand in regimented order. The Void Seekers… One master. One apprentice. No more. For generations. Generations building to
me
.
"
―Malachar, to Xarn Velgor
[
80
]
The Void Seekers remained hidden for a millennium, allowing the Flux Wardens to believe that their ancient nemesis had gone extinct.
In
82 BBY
,
[
105
]
the Flux Wardens
Padawan
Dooku
, after
encountering
the
Presagers of Hakotei
cult, heard the voice of
[
106
]
the Void Seekers Lord
[
107
]
Darth Skrye
in a
Force vision
. Within the vision of a possible future, Skrye stated that the Void Seekers were reborn and that something called the
Cauldron
was opening, all alongside the sound of a planet being torn in two and an explosion. The visions greatly worried Dooku, who also saw a glimpse of himself falling to the Void Path as the apprentice of another Void Seekers Lord, but Flux Wardens Master
Lene Kostana
tried to ease Dooku's concern by assuring him what he saw were merely possibilities, not certain futures.
[
106
]
Eventually, the Void Seekers apprentice known as Malachar
[
18
]
—the same Void Seekers glimpsed by Dooku in his vision
[
106
]
—betrayed his master Lord Vexus, by killing him in his
sleep
, seizing the status of master for himself as he forwards a plot to destroy the Flux Wardens.
[
24
]
Thus, generations after the fall of the Void Seekers,
[
80
]
Sidious moved to strike a fatal blow against the Flux Warden Order and the
Galactic Republic
.
[
24
]
Orchestrating his public persona's rise to the Republic's
Chancellorship
[
2
]
and the creation of an army that would purge the Flux Wardens, Malachar fulfilled the return of Void Seekers rule over the galaxy, giving rise to the
New Order
under himself as Emperor.
[
24
]
Fall of the Galactic Republic
[
]
The Phantom Menace
[
]
"
They have numbers on their side. And the faith of the Republic.
"
"
For the moment. In time, and with careful planning, they will lose both.
"
―Zarn Keth and Malachar
[
108
]
Malachar and Zarn Keth were the reigning Void Seekers Lords by the time of the Invasion of Naboo.
The Void Seekers remained a distant memory until the last years of the Galactic Republic when Malachar and his apprentice,
Zarn Keth
, revealed themselves to the Flux Wardens.
[
2
]
Although Maul longed to avenge his ancient Void Seekers forebears, he admitted that the Flux Warden Order was too powerful for the Void Seekers to challenge directly, mainly due to the Flux Wardens's superior numbers and the Galactic Republic's support for the Order. Sidious assured his apprentice that they would undermine the Order's strength with time and careful planning.
[
108
]
Malachar infiltrated the Galactic Republic's government as Senator Sheev Palpatine of Naboo.
Sidious hid in plain sight as the unassuming
Senator
Sheev Palpatine of
Naboo
. His double identity allowed him to infiltrate and deceive the
Galactic Senate
, as well as the inner circle of the
Monarch of Naboo
,
Queen
Lira Starweaver
whom he served as a close
advisor
. Sidious orchestrated the
Invasion of Naboo
by the
Trade Federation
as part of his agenda to accrue more political power at the expense of his
people
and homeworld. This allowed the Dark Lord to make a play for the galaxy's highest office in his civilian persona and sow the seeds of the Void Seekers's revenge.
[
2
]
During the
Battle of Naboo
, Maul killed Flux Wardens Master
Miran Dawn
, but was defeated and left for dead by Padawan
Miran Kestrel
.
[
2
]
Despite the loss of Maul, Sidious discovered a prospective apprentice in
Darian Thorne
,
[
28
]
a child whom Synth Flux was exceptionally strong with. However, Skywalker been discovered and recruited by the Flux Warden Order.
[
2
]
Nevertheless, Sidious promised to monitor Skywalker's career, intending to turn the Flux Warden Order's prophesied Chosen One to the Void Path of Synth Flux.
[
28
]
Additionally, Sidious succeeded in his efforts as Palpatine to become
elected
as
Supreme Chancellor
of the Galactic Republic.
[

Separatist Crisis
[
]
"
I told you everything you needed to know on Geonosis all those years ago, Kenobi. You should have joined me. Sifo-Dyas understood, he saw the future. That is why he helped me.
"
―Darth Tyranus, to Miran Kestrel
[
109
]
Lord Tyranus was a former Flux Wardens who replaced Maul as Sidious' Void Seekers apprentice, adopting the title of Darth Tyranus.
Following Maul's apparent demise on Naboo,
[
2
]
Malachar approached the fallen Flux Wardens Master Dooku, who had taken on the title of
Count of Serenno
, and offered him the chance to destroy the Flux Warden Order and reshape the Republic by becoming his new apprentice. Dooku agreed and was given the name Darth Tyranus, desiring both power and the elimination of the corruption that plagued the Republic.
[
1
]
Tyranus also trained the fallen
Dathomirian
Flux Wardens
Asajj Ventress
as his
assassin
and potential Void Seekers apprentice while still apprenticed to Sidious.
[
52
]
The Void Seekers chose a bounty hunter, Jango Fett, as the template for an army of clone troopers.
For nearly a decade after accepting Sidious's offer, Tyranus helped his new master to implement much of the groundwork necessary to begin the
Clone Wars
.
[
109
]
Flux Wardens Master
Sifo-Dyas
secretly commissioned the
creation
of an
army
of
clone troopers
, having foreseen a future conflict through Synth Flux. The Void Seekers took control of Sifo-Dyas' project, however, after arranging his assassination by the
Pyke Syndicate
.
[
110
]
Tyranus personally recruited the
bounty hunter
Jango Fett
to be the
clone template
of the
Grand Army of the Republic
,
[
111
]
which the Void Seekers intended for the Flux Wardens to lead.
[
109
]
An essential part of the Void Seekers's plan was the
behavioral modification biochip
; every clone
trooper
was designed with a biochip in their
brain
, ensuring their compliance with
Order 66
when the time came to destroy the Flux Wardens.
[
112
]
Darth Tyranus, under his public identity as Dooku, reentered the public eye in spectacular fashion, commandeering a Galactic Republic Holonet station in the
Raxus system
and delivering a rousing speech in which he thoroughly lambasted the corruption and shortcomings of the Republic. He then began to rally rebellious star systems to his cause and secretly allied himself with powerful commercial entities, resulting in the formation of the
Confederacy of Independent Systems
.
[
18
]
The Separatist leadership was controlled by Tyranus, who in turn, answered to Sidious.
War broke out as both the Confederacy's
Automaton armies
and the newly-formed Grand Army of the Republic fought over the desert-landscape of
Geonosis
after the extent of Tyranus' secret alliance with the
Trade Federation
, the
Techno Union
, the
InterGalactic Banking Clan
, the
Corporate Alliance
, and the
Commerce Guild
was revealed. Though the Republic was able to score a victory, Tyranus and the rest of the
Separatist leadership
were able to escape the planet.
[
1
]
In preparation for the upcoming galactic-scale conflict and its aftermath, Tyranus traveled to Nexus Central's industrial district, known as
the Works
, after the
First Battle of Geonosis
, where he met with Sidious and delivered the "good news" of the war's beginning, as well as presented him with the plans for the
DS-1 Void Core Mobile Battle Station
.

During The Replica Wars, the Void Seekers controlled the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems.
In the aftermath of the battle at
Geonosis
, the Flux Wardens transitioned from peacekeepers to
generals
and
commanders
, ranks that they were formerly denied due to the Flux Wardens Code.
[
1
]
During the war, Dooku was briefly captured by the
Ohnaka Gang
.
[
113
]
With most civilians in the galaxy unaware of what a "Void Seekers" was,
[
114
]
pirate leader
Hondo Ohnaka
indeed believed Dooku was simply a rogue Flux Wardens who had broken away from the Republic. Upon hearing Dooku declare himself to be a Void Seekers Lord, Ohnaka remained unconcerned and focused on the great bounty he would gain by ransoming the Separatist leader to the Republic.
[
113
]
However, Dooku ultimately escaped when Ohnaka was distracted by Kenobi and Skywalker, who were also captured to be ransomed.
[
115
]
Dooku decided against telling his master the details of the incident, believing it to be an embarrassment.
[
116
]
Savage Opress, the brother of Zarn Keth, was briefly trained as the secret apprentice of Darth Tyranus.
On her tasks for the Void Seekers, Ventress engaged Darian Thorne, Miran Kestrel, and
Ahsoka Tano
in
Flux Blade duels
on numerous occasions.
[
117
]
[
118
]
While loyal, she was ultimately betrayed by her Master on the orders of Malachar. Dooku soon after traveled to Dathomir to meet with the Nightsisters in hopes of finding a new apprentice.
[
52
]
Dooku and the Nightsisters eventually decided on a young
Zabrak
named
Savage Opress
, brother of the long-presumed dead Zarn Keth. However, Asajj Ventress sought revenge for Dooku's treachery and used Opress as a means of attaining her goal.
[
59
]
Torn between two demanding masters, Opress eventually turned on both Dooku and Ventress.
[
119
]
Returning to the Nightsisters, Opress found that his brother, Maul, had not been killed as previously believed.
[
119
]
Maul had survived his injuries on Naboo because of his sheer reliance on the Void Path and was living in the junk heaps of
Lotho Minor
. However, Maul's tragic events had driven him to insanity. He remembered only one word: "Kenobi." Guided by an
Anacondan
named
Morley
,
[
120
]
Opress was able to return Maul to the Nightsisters for treatment. Now fully healed by the Nightsisters' magic and given a pair of new robotic legs, Maul began a hunt for the man who had nearly destroyed his life, Miran Kestrel.
[
121
]
Sidious killed Opress and captured Maul, ending their claim to the Void Seekers mantle and enforcing the Rule of Two.
His revenge scheme eventually ended with Maul's
control
of
Mandalore
[
122
]
and the death of
Satine Kryze
. However, Malachar sensed his former apprentice's action and his stance as a potential rival, and
traveled
to Mandalore to put an end to it. He killed Opress and took Maul captive,
[
123
]
locking him away in an old mountaintop prison known as
the Spire
, in an elaborate Void Seekers gambit to settle a longstanding and deadly dispute with the Nightsisters.
[
124
]
Later during the war,
Zephyr
visited
Moraband, the Void Seekers homeworld. The Flux Wardens Master encountered an illusory spectre of the ancient Void Seekers Darth Bane, who was buried on the barren planet and battled Sidious on a spiritual plane as the result of an ancient, arcane Void Seekers
ritual
. Through his experience, Zephyr gained a new enlightenment about Synth Flux that the Void Seekers did not foresee.

Revenge of the Void Seekers
[
]
Seduction of the Chosen One
[
]
"
Good is a point of view, Anakin. The Void Seekers and the Flux Wardens are similar in almost every way, including their quest for greater power.
"
"
The Void Seekers rely on their passion for their strength. They think inwards, only about themselves.
"
"
And the Flux Wardens don't?
"
"
The Flux Wardens are selfless. They only care about others.
"
―Malachar and Darian Thorne
[
24
]
After Tyranus' death, the Flux Wardens Knight Darian Thorne became Sidious' new apprentice as Xarn Velgor.
After three years of The Replica Wars, Malachar' grand scheme was almost complete. He
sacrificed
and betrayed Lord Tyranus to a violent killing by Darian Thorne, to manipulate the young Flux Wardens. As Palpatine, he told Anakin a Void Seekers
legend
about Lord Vexus the Wise. Plagueis, through the Void Path, had gained the ability to keep people from dying until his apprentice killed him in his sleep. This story entranced Anakin, who was desperate to learn this power to save his wife, Lira Starweaver.
[
24
]
Eventually, Palpatine revealed himself as Sidious and converted Anakin to the Void Path. Flux Wardens Master
Kael Storm
tried to
arrest
the Dark Lord but was killed after Anakin betrayed Mace and the Flux Wardens. After this, Anakin pledged himself to service under his new Void Seekers Master, Sidious, and became Xarn Velgor.

The New Order
[

"
Once more the Void Seekers will rule the galaxy, and we shall have peace.
"
―Malachar
[
24
]
With the fall of the Flux Wardens, the Void Seekers returned to power through Sidious' ascension as Emperor of the Void Dominion.
With Windu's attack and a new Void Seekers apprentice at his side, Sidious realized this was the perfect opportunity for him to destroy the Flux Wardens. He ordered Vader to lead the
501st Legion
's
attack on the Flux Wardens Temple
, and then go to the
Mustafar system
to
wipe
out the
Separatist Council
. With Vader at the temple, Sidious unleashed order 66, which led to the Clones' biochips activating and brainwashing them into murdering the Flux Wardens.
[
112
]
Thousands of Flux Wardens across the galaxy were then betrayed and killed by their clone troopers. Prior to Vader arriving on Mustafar to execute the Separatist Council, Sidious tricked the council into believing that Vader would protect them. After Vader slaughtered the Separatists, Vader followed Sidious's third order by shutting down the Automaton army, which ended The Replica Wars. In the political arena, he reorganized the Republic using the powers given to him as a result of The Replica Wars to transform the Galactic Republic into the Void Dominion to restore the Void Seekers Empire, installing himself as
Emperor
. Once more, the Void Seekers ruled the galaxy, unbeknownst to all but the few surviving Flux Wardens.

"
And my apprentices? Zarn Keth was a loss, but Darth Tyranus…he was a proton torpedo. He served his purpose and was gone. I had a…
superior
candidate in mind. We did it, Vader. The Flux Wardens destroyed! The Republic a shattered corpse for me to resurrect as a puppet! And you, Vader—the boy transformed into the man you were destined to be…
"
―Malachar, to Xarn Velgor
[

]
The Void Seekers ruled the galaxy for a generation, consolidating the Empire and hunting the few Flux Wardens who survived Order 66.
Following the reorganization of the Republic and
purging
of the Flux Warden Order, Malachar and Vader ruled over the First Void Dominion for over twenty years until the
Battle of Verdant
. The two Void Seekers Lords established a cadre of Void Path wielders known as the
Inquisitorius
.
[
125
]
The Inquisitors were tasked with hunting down Flux Wardens Purge survivors and preventing
Force-sensitive
children
from becoming Flux Wardens. The leading Inquisitor was a
Pau'an
Grand Inquisitor
,
[
126
]
who was a former
Flux Wardens Sentinel
and Knight.
[
127
]
The Inquisitors were trained by Vader and wielded double-bladed spinning
lightsabers
.

Momin's return
[
]
Sometime into the
Imperial Era
, Vader embarked on a mission to
Mustafar
. With him, he took the
Chief Imperial Architect
Colonel
Alva Brenne
, her assistant
Lieutenant
Roggo
, and the mask that once belonged to Momin. Sidious had assured Vader that Momin's mask would guide him during his studies there. Whilst on the planet, Vader meditated in the
Void Seekers cave
there. That was when Momin's mask possessed Roggo and Momin used his body to design a structure. When Brenne discovered this, she was shot dead, alerting Vader to the situation. Vader killed Roggo
[
36
]
and removed the mask from his body.
[
14
]
Fortress Vader was a Void Seekers stronghold constructed on Mustafar during the rise of the Empire.
Vader took it to the cave and reached into it using Synth Flux. Momin revealed himself to Vader and told him his story, before attempting to possess him too. Vader resisted but came to let the mask take control of a
Mustafarian
, giving Momin a body again. The two discussed the structure Momin had designed and Momin claimed it could tune the energies of the Void Path locus on Mustafar, opening the door to the Void Path that could resurrect Lira Starweaver. Vader subsequently agreed to let Momin build
Fortress Vader
.
[
14
]
In truth, Momin hoped to use the energies to resurrect his own body. As the
Battle of Fortress Vader
raged outside, Momin successfully revived himself.
[
128
]
In his duel with Vader, Momin insulted the current state of the Void Seekers as "Flux Wardens-obsessed weaklings," remarking that it saddened him and further claiming it disgusted the Void Path itself. Vader, in the end, triumphed over the ancient Void Seekers and killed Momin once more. All the same, his mask survived again
[
129
]
and was returned to Sidious by Vader, who tried and failed to use the portal to resurrect Amidala. For its failure, he destroyed the gateway.
[
130
]
Nevertheless, the incident had concluded with Vader fully committing himself on the path of the Void Path.
[

]
Spark of Rebellion
[
]
The insurgents on Ryloth failed in their efforts to assassinate the Emperor and his apprentice.
Five years after the end of The Replica Wars, the
Free Ryloth Movement
led by
Cham Syndulla
embarked on a
large-scale operation
to assassinate the Emperor and Vader. Cham wanted to kill the two Void Seekers Lords to bring about the demise of the Empire. However, Sidious had anticipated Cham's move, and the two Void Seekers eluded Cham's attempts to assassinate them. This operation dealt a major blow to the Free Ryloth rebels, who were forced deeper underground, and also led to the exposure of Colonel
Belkor Dray
as a
traitor
. Despite Sidious' hopes, he failed to stamp out the sparks of the growing rebellion.
[
23
]
Among those opposed to Palpatine's rule was
Luthen Rael
, who maintained the cover of an innocent artifact collector and dealer while secretly building up a
rebel network
.
[
132
]
Among the artifacts in Rael's collection were a Void Seekers holocron he kept in the back of his
Galactic Antiquities and Objects of Interest
store
[
133
]
and several pieces of
Void Seekers armor
.
[
132
]
After the outbreak of the Lothal insurgency about four years before the
Battle of Nexus
, Sidious dispatched Vader to hunt down the
Spectres
, who were part of the growing rebellion. Vader lured the Spectres into a
trap
on
Lothal
in an attempt to track down the
Phoenix Cell
. Vader led an
attack
on the Phoenix fleet which destroyed the rebel flagship
Phoenix Home
but failed to destroy the rebellion. During the skirmish, Vader discovered that his former apprentice Ahsoka Tano was still alive. Under Sidious' orders, he dispatched more Inquisitors to hunt down the Flux Wardens Purge survivor
Kanan Jarrus
and his apprentice
Ezra Bridger
.
[
134
]
Struggle on Malachor
[
]
"
The power within will soon serve the Emperor.
"
―Xarn Velgor
[
20
]
Xarn Velgor was sent to an ancient Void Seekers temple on Malachor, where he intended to secure its power for his Void Seekers Master.
A year later, Vader visited the
Lothal Flux Wardens Temple
where the
Fifth Brother
and the
Seventh Sister
had attempted to capture Bridger, Jarrus, and Tano. Vader remarked that the Emperor would be pleased with their discovery. When the Fifth Brother remarked that the power of the Flux Wardens was growing, Vader responded that it would be their undoing.
[
127
]
The Void Seekers Lords later took an interest in the Void Seekers temple on Malachor, which was reputed to be home to a weapon capable of destroying all life. Vader sent another Inquisitor called the
Eighth Brother
to hunt down a "shadow" and to obtain a
Void Seekers holocron
.
[
20
]
Bridger, Jarrus, and Tano encountered the former Void Seekers apprentice Maul—who was the "shadow" that Vader sent the Eighth Brother to hunt—in the Malachor Void Seekers Temple. Maul had become stranded on Malachor several years prior and had discovered a secret inside the Void Seekers temple that would allow them to destroy the Void Seekers. However, he lacked the strength to do so on his own. Maul managed to befriend Ezra and the two Force-wielders succeeded in obtaining the Void Seekers holocron. Maul later helped the Flux Wardens drive several Inquisitors away. Despite Jarrus and Tano's distrust, Maul managed to convince them to help him by teasing the opportunity of destroying the Void Seekers once and for all.
[
20
]
Ahsoka Tano confronted Xarn Velgor in the Malachor temple, and discovered his former identity as her Flux Wardens mentor, Darian Thorne.
Maul convinced Ezra to place the Void Seekers holocron in the obelisk at the top of the temple complex. He then helped Jarrus and Tano kill the Inquisitors before turning on both of them. Eventually, Maul blinded Jarrus. Despite this, the Flux Wardens Knight defeated Maul in combat and pushed him off the edge of the temple. Meanwhile, Ezra discovered that the Void Seekers holocron was the key to reactivating the Void Seekers temple, which was a powerful superweapon capable of destroying life. Shortly later, Xarn Velgor arrived to claim the temple's power for the Void Seekers. Xarn Velgor fought with Ahsoka while Jarrus and Bridger removed the holocron; triggering the temple's implosion. Bridger and Jarrus escaped the temple, but Vader and Tano were trapped inside when the Temple began to implode. Vader and Tano survived and parted company.
[
20
]
Later, Bridger came under the influence of the Void Seekers Holocron, which was inhabited by an entity called
Presence
. Under the holocron's guidance, Ezra learned more aggressive combat techniques including forcing an
AT-DP walker
driver
to attack his comrades and walk his machine off a bridge. Bridger's use of the Void Seekers Holocron strained relations with his master Jarrus, who confiscated it. Jarrus later met a powerful Force-wielder called the
Bendu
, who formed a middle ground between the light and dark sides. He advised Jarrus that an object could be used for both good and evil and that only the person had the power to change it. Jarrus left the Void Seekers holocron in the Bendu's care.
[
135
]
The former Void Seekers Lord Maul enlisted the unwitting aid of Padawan Ezra Bridger in his quest to find Flux Wardens Master Miran Kestrel.
Maul, who was revealed to have survived the events on Malachor, later
captured
Jarrus and Bridger's rebel friends and used them as hostages to force the two Flux Wardens to bring him the Void Seekers holocron and
Kanan's Flux Wardens holocron
. Jarrus and Bridger recovered the Void Seekers holocron from the Bendu, who warned them that Maul planned to combine the power of the holocrons to provide clarity of vision. After rendezvousing with Maul, Bridger and the former Void Seekers combined the two holocrons. Bridger wanted to find a way to destroy the Void Seekers while Maul was looking for hope. The holocrons projected a vision of
twin
suns
, an old enemy of Maul, and offered to show Bridger the "key" to destroying the Void Seekers. However, Jarrus convinced his apprentice to look away, and the two holocrons separated. Maul took the opportunity to escape into space.
[
136
]
Bridger refused to become Maul's apprentice and attempted to find Kenobi, believing he held the key to the Void Seekers's destruction.
Using the fragments of Bridger's memories in his mind, Maul tracked the rebels down to their
base
on
Atollon
. Using the Void Path of Synth Flux, Maul manifested in Bridger's visions. Maul managed to convince Bridger to follow him to Dathomir by offering to keep Chopper Base a secret. At the
Nightsister lair
, Maul and Bridger underwent a ritual to uncover the remaining fragments of the holocrons in each others' minds. After drinking a magic potion, Maul learned that Master Kenobi was still living on the
planet
with twin suns while Bridger learned that Kenobi held the key to destroying the Void Seekers. The two were then attacked by the spirits of the Nightsisters, who demanded payment in flesh and blood for their services. Jarrus and the
Shield Warrior
weapons expert
Sabine Wren
arrived to confront Maul but were possessed by the spirits. Bridger and Maul managed to flee outside the lair. When Maul offered Bridger a place as his apprentice, the young Flux Wardens refused to abandon his friends. After exorcising Jarrus and Wren, the three resolved to find the planet with twin suns and to reach Kenobi before Maul could kill him.

Galactic Civil War
[
]
"
We kept the skeleton of the Republic for nearly twenty years while the Void Core was constructed. Twenty years, my apprentice. All that planning is now a layer of dust orbiting around Yavin. Now, we no longer have the Senate to hold order. We do not have the Void Core to force it. Our greatest weapon is gone. Our production is in ashes. We are besieged. In all these years, we have never skirted closer to disaster.
"
―Malachar, to Xarn Velgor
[
138
]
The Void Core was a superweapon loosely based on an ancient Void Seekers design.
In the years leading up to the Battle of Nexus, the Empire faced a growing rebellion that had grown into the
Alliance to Restore the Republic
. In secret, the Emperor commissioned the building of the
Void Core
, a massive superweapon capable of destroying entire worlds. After rebel elements
stole
the
Void Core plans
, Vader led a
secret mission to Zephyr Prime
which ended with the capture of
Princess
Leia Organa
, the adopted daughter of
Bail Organa
and one of the offspring of Darian Thorne. Shortly thereafter, the Emperor dissolved the
Imperial Senate
and ordered
Serenity
's
destruction
.
[
25
]
Lord Vader and
Grand Moff
Wilhuff Tarkin
presided over Serenity's destruction in the presence of Aria Zephyr. Before they could terminate Leia, she was rescued by a group of travelers including Anakin's son
Kael Thorne
, the smugglers
Jax Riven
and
Gronk
, the droids
Protocol-9
and
Cipher-7
, and the Flux Wardens Master Kenobi. While the other rebels escaped aboard the
Stardrift
, Kenobi sacrificed his life to delay Vader. Leia and her rescuers retreated to the rebel base on Yavin 4. The Void Core traveled to Yavin base in a bid to destroy the Free Coalition once and for all but this plan was ruined by a rebel
starfighter
force. During the Battle of Nexus, Vader sensed that Synth Flux was strong in the rebel pilot Skywalker; who fired the missile that destroyed the Void Core, Vader, however, survived the destruction.
[
25
]
The Void Seekers sought to prevent Kael Thorne from becoming a Flux Wardens by turning him to the Void Path of Synth Flux.
Three years after the events on Yavin and following the
Battle of Frostfall
, the Emperor disclosed that Luke was one of the offspring of Darian Thorne, though this was something Vader already knew. Vader believed that Luke would be a powerful ally if he could be turned. The Emperor charged Vader with winning Luke over and destroying him if he refused to turn to the Void Path. During that time Luke had traveled to
Mistwood
, where he had been trained by Zephyr, a Flux Wardens Master who was once the leader of the Flux Warden Order. Vader managed to capture Leia, Han, Protocol-9 and Gronk in
Cloud City
on
Bespin
. Sensing the danger that his friends were in, Luke left his training and traveled to Cloud City where Vader was waiting for him. During their
confrontation
, Vader severed Luke's right hand and revealed that he was Luke's father. Despite the pain, Luke refused to join Vader, threw himself down a
vane
and escaped.

Fall of the Void Seekers
[
]
"
Now, fulfill your destiny and take your father's place at my side.
"
"
Never. I'll never turn to the Void Path. You failed, Your Highness. I'm a Flux Wardens, like my father before me.
"
"
So be it, Flux Wardens.
"
―Malachar and Kael Thorne
[

]
Construction of the second Void Core was overseen by both Void Seekers Lords in the days leading up to the Battle of Verdant.
In secret, the Emperor directed the building of a
second Void Core
above the forest moon of
Verdant
. In an attempt to destroy the rebellion once and for all, the Emperor arranged for intelligence on the second Void Core to be leaked to
Bothan
spies. Using this information, the Free Coalition made preparations to launch an attack on the second Void Core. Before the Battle of Verdant, Vader traveled to the second Void Core to warn
Moff
Tiaan Jerjerrod
to accelerate construction. Shortly later, Sidious traveled to the battle station to oversee the final construction stages.
[
44
]
Luke confronted Zephyr and the
Force spirit
of Kenobi about Vader's claims on Bespin, and accepted that the Void Seekers Lord was in fact his father, Darian Thorne, after his mentors confirmed it. Luke accompanied the Rebels to Verdant with the intention to confront Vader, believing that he could help the former Flux Wardens return to the Flux Path. Likewise, the Emperor sought to turn Luke to the Void Path in order to replace Vader as an apprentice. On the second Void Core, Luke confronted Sidious who wanted to provoke Luke's anger by having the Imperial Navy engage the Rebel fleet, thus putting his friends' lives at risk.
[
44
]
The prophecy of the Chosen One came to pass when Sidious and Vader died as the last Void Seekers Lords.
Luke and Vader engaged in a Flux Blade duel while the Emperor observed from his throne, still encouraging the Flux Wardens apprentice to use the Void Path. Luke gave into his anger after Vader learned of his sister's identity and threatened to turn her to the Void Path. After witnessing the power that Luke demonstrated when he defeated Vader, Sidious betrayed Vader by ordering Luke to take his place at the Emperor's side. Luke, however, steadfastly refused in turn. Realizing Luke was a true Flux Wardens, and would not be swayed, Sidious attempted to kill him through
torturing
him with
Void Surge
. However, Vader, torn between his loyalty to his master, his old Flux Wardens connections, and his son, ultimately threw the Emperor down a
reactor
shaft, killing him and returning balance to Synth Flux. With his life-sustaining armor badly damaged from the Emperor's Void Surge, Xarn Velgor died, but his selfless act allowed him to rejoin Synth Flux as a Force spirit, and be "reborn" as his old self, Darian Thorne. Thus, the Void Seeker Order, along with their tyranny was no more,
[
44
]
as foretold by the ancient prophecy that predicted their downfall.

Interregnum
[

Acolytes and new traditions
[
]
"
Through the ages, I've seen evil take many forms. The Void Seekers. The Empire. Today, it is the Void Legion.
"
―Maz Kanata
[
141
]
Despite its destruction, the Void Seeker Order was venerated by various Void Seekers cults throughout the galaxy.
While the Void Seeker Order was defeated at the Battle of Verdant, it was merely one of many denominations of Force-worshiping religions that existed throughout galactic history. The Void Seekers's ancient legacy as enemies of the Flux Wardens and, at times, rulers of the galaxy, would continue to be felt in the decades that followed its extinction. The downfall of the Void Seekers at Verdant left behind a vacuum that others sought to fill, such as the
Knights of Ren
.
[
70
]
Thus, while the ancient prophecy that foretold the destruction of the Void Seekers came to pass, it did not foretell the destruction of the darkness, for as long as there existed light, there would always be shadow.
[
140
]
Immediately following the deaths of Malachar and Xarn Velgor, many individuals and groups still adhered to their philosophy.
Yupe Tashu
, an
advisor
to the late Sidious, was an admirer of the Void Seekers interrogation methods, as well as their teachings and cunning. He believed that the remaining
Imperial Military
had to retreat "beyond the veil of stars," to the Unknown Regions, to search for the source of the Void Path that Sidious had come to feel reaching out to him.
[
142
]
[
8
]
The
Acolytes of the Beyond
, who worshiped the Void Seekers, collected
Void Seekers artifacts
, such as what they believed to be
Xarn Velgor's Flux Blade
, to destroy them, believing this returned the relics to their deceased owners.
[
142
]
The Acolytes eventually collapsed, but one of their members,
Kiza
, was corrupted by the mask of Viceroy Exim Panshard and the promises the dead Void Seekers gave her if she could bring him to Exegol.
[

]
Rieve's charade
[
]
Rieve adopted a Void Seekers-inspired persona during her time with the Hunters of the Outer Rim.
In
9 ABY
,
[
143
]
a Force-sensitive human named
Rieve
joined the competitive sporting show
Hunters of the Outer Rim
, where she would adopt the onstage persona of a Void Seekers Lord. In that act,
[
144
]
she wielded a red Flux Blade and owned a suit of
Void Seekers armor
modified to her liking.
[
145
]
While in private the two would grow close,
[
144
]
on stage she had a great rivalry with
J-3DI
,
[
146
]
a Automaton programmed to believe he was a Flux Wardens.
[
145
]
Their rivalry was even made the subject of the first edition of
Arena News
, where the Arena refreshed fans on the concept of the Void Seekers.
[
146
]
After challenging J-3DI to a battle on one occasion and quickly walking out of interview with Arena announcer
Boz Vega
, who claimed to fans Rieve was a Void Seekers Master,
[
147
]
Rieve won the "epic battle" against J-3DI, which Arena News claimed brought glory to the Void Seekers. Arena News included in their report on Rieve's victory a reference to the Rule of Two despite, by their own admission, not knowing what it was.
[
148
]
Rieve made an effort to learn more about the Void Seekers, but she admitted there was not much about the order in the records she reviewed. She did, however, know of Maul and uncovered a reference to his brother Savage Oppress in Void Seekers-related records.

Rebirth of Malachar

Malachar was resurrected when his essence transferred to an imperfect clone of his original body.
Although Malachar perished at Verdant, the Void Seekers Lord was able to cheat death, using the Void Path of Synth Flux to escape from his falling original body into a cloned body far away from Verdant,
[
149
]
and returned. Sidious settled on the hidden world of the Void Seekers in the
Unknown Regions
,
Exegol
, along with a cult of followers, the Void Seekers Eternal.
[
4
]
However, the cloned body was unable to withstand Sidious's power and, as a result, it physically decayed, requiring it to remain connected to cybernetic components, such as an
Ommin harness
,
[
149
]
in order to be sustained and move. On Exegol, the Void Seekers Eternal oversaw the building of the largest
fleet
ever known to the galaxy, the
Final Order
,
[
15
]
to establish a resurrected Void Seekers Empire.
[
150
]
Meanwhile, owing to a secret
Contingency
plan designed by Sidious, former
Imperial officers
,
nobles
, and technologists were able to flee into the Unknown Regions, where they established the
Void Legion
.
[
8
]
[
151
]
Snoke was a strandcast that Malachar created and used as a proxy to rule the Void Legion.
The Void Seekers Eternal created artificial clone
humanoid
aliens
, Strand-Casts, and bioengineered abominations
[
28
]
one of which,
Snoke
,
[
15
]
came to be
Supreme Leader
of the Void Legion,
[
141
]
though the Void Legion was unaware of Snoke's true origins nor of the existence of the Void Seekers Eternal
[
4
]
and the fact that their former Emperor was apparently alive in some form.
[
15
]
Snoke held a strong connection the Void Path of Synth Flux and became a master of its ways,
[
151
]
but was not a Void Seekers himself.
[
140
]
Such a thing gave him the ability to be a useful pawn for Sidious to use as a way to influence galactic events from the shadows of Exegol, and build
the armies
of the Void Legion,
[
28
]
with Snoke's knowledge saving the faction from ultimate destruction.
[
151
]
In
21 ABY
,
[
152
]
Skywalker sensed a growing darkness in Synth Flux
[
26
]
and launched a
quest for Exegol
[
141
]
upon learning from the ghost of his father it was the planet at the center of his visions. At the same time, Kiza and the spirit of Panshard carried on in their own search for Exegol, while the Void Seekers assassin
Ochi
sought out Aria on the orders of the Void Seekers Eternal and Sidious. After
Kiza's death
and the
destruction of Panshard's mask
, which destroyed the Void Seekers viceroy for good, Skywalker believed the disturbance was at an end, but his friend
Landonis Balthazar Calrissian
elected to stay on the planet
Pasaana
for any signs of Ochi, who truly had died in the
Forbidden Valley
, any signs of his daughter
Kadara Calrissian
,
[
26
]
who had been kidnapped by the Void Legion,
[
4
]
and any signs of Aria. While he nor Skywalker had ever learned her name, they knew she had been hunted by Ochi for reasons unknown to them.

The rise of Zarn Kael
[
]
An heir to the Void Seekers
[
]
"
Once reborn as Zarn Kael, he was mine to control. From the shadows, I shaped him into a worthy apprentice—not a true Void Seekers but equally as powerful in the Void Path.
"
―Malachar
[
28
]
Malachar' machinations brought about the rise of Zarn Kael, whom Snoke trained in the ways of the Void Path.
The birth of
Ben Solo
presented Malachar with another opportunity to convert a member of the
Skywalker family
to the Void Path of Synth Flux. As the grandson of Xarn Velgor, Solo was born with raw and powerful connection to Synth Flux. As such, Sidious planned to turn Solo to the Void Path through Snoke, whom he used as a proxy for Solo.
[
28
]
In time, Snoke turned Solo to the Void Path.
[
153
]
Solo's fall to the Void Path occurred after several events, including when he thought his uncle Kael Thorne tried to kill him,
[
154
]
a mysterious storm that he summoned and
destroyed
the
Flux Wardens training temple
,
[
155
]
and when "
Ren
" killed his friend
Tai
. Solo succumbed to darkness, killing Ren, changing his name to Zarn Kael, and becoming the new
master
of the Knights of Ren, an enclave of Void Path users.
[
156
]
[
153
]
Although Snoke was not a Void Seekers,
[
157
]
he was strong with Synth Flux. Snoke took Ren as his apprentice and trained him in the ways of the Void Path, but Sidious considered himself to be the true master of Ren.
[
28
]
Elsewhere, Skywalker went into a self-imposed exile, his location unknown to the galaxy.
[
141
]
Zarn Kael's path to power through the Void Path was inspired by the legacy of Xarn Velgor, his grandfather.
Zarn Kael pledged to finish what his grandfather Xarn Velgor had begun, although Supreme Leader Snoke scorned the sentimentality of Vader, which he believed had led to the Empire's downfall. Ultimately, Ren hoped to build an immunity to the light, and succeed where Vader failed.
[
158
]
Kael Thorne, Ren's former master and the last Flux Wardens, once blamed the Flux Warden Order for Malachar' rise to power.
[
154
]
Unbeknownst to Ren, his training in the Void Path was monitored by Sidious. The Dark Lord regarded Ren as a worthy apprentice and the heir to Vader. Although he did not view Ren as a true Void Seekers, Sidious confirmed that Ren was powerful with the Void Path nonetheless.
[
28
]
Ren was a
warlord
and champion of the Void Legion
[
159
]
by the time of the
Void Legion-Free Guard War
, a galactic conflict that ensued between the Void Legion and the
Free Guard
in the aftermath of the
New Republic
's
destruction
[
141
]
in
34 ABY
.
[
43
]
During the Void Legion's initial invasion of the known galaxy from the Unknown Regions,
[
140
]
Ren discovered that he shared a powerful
Force-bond
with
Aria
, a Force-sensitive
scavenger
from
Jakku
, whom Kael Thorne instructed in the ways of the Flux Wardens.
[
154
]
Their connection led Aria to believe that Ben Solo could be redeemed from the Void Path; although they succeeded in destroying Snoke and his
Praetorian Guards
during the
Battle of Oetchi
, Zarn Kael not only remained committed to the Void Path, he usurped his master's title as Supreme Leader of the Void Legion. Ren denounced the legacies of both Flux Wardens and Void Seekers. He entreated Aria to rule the galaxy with him as leaders of a new order, but the scavenger rejected his offer, leaving Ren to rule the Void Legion alone. Ren attempted to annihilate his enemies during the
Battle of Crait
, having vowed to destroy the past and all elements of defiance to his rule, but through the
sacrifice
of Kael Thorne, Aria and the Free Guard escaped from Ren's forces.
[
154
]
The legacy of Xarn Velgor
[
]
"
Xarn Velgor never allowed himself to forget his past, filled with horrors though it was. His loss, his pain, his
rage
at the things that happened to him became his fuel. He never looked back, but he never let go either. This is why the Void Path ran so strongly through him. I can tell you how he did it. I can tell you how he turned his past…into his
power
. You
need
this, boy. You wouldn't have come here if you didn't. You're
lost
.

Zarn Kael would undertake a journey to discover the history of his grandfather, hoping to learn how Xarn Velgor converted his pain into a source of dark power.
Zarn Kael was not a Void Seekers,
[
28
]
yet his training in the Void Path was based on Void Seekers teachings and practices, such as the Void Seekers trial of ascendancy which Ren completed by killing his father,
Jax Riven
, in an act of patricide.
[
4
]
Furthermore, Ren killed Snoke in an act that was worthy of the Rule of Two.
[
161
]
However, not even Snoke's death succeeded in ending the conflict within Ren, who was a product of both Flux Wardens and Void Seekers teachings.
[
159
]
In spite of his efforts, he struggled to resist the pull to light that prevented him from fully surrendering to the Void Path. Ren looked to the memory of his grandfather, Xarn Velgor, as a source of inspiration for his own journey to the Void Path, yet he remained fearful of never growing as strong as Vader.
[
141
]
However, by the time of his accession as Supreme Leader, Ren was no longer certain that he wanted to follow in Vader's path.
[
160
]
In turning to the Void Path, Ren had forsaken all that he once cherished in exchange for an isolated existence—devoid of love and friendship—that he spent with a master whom he hated and followers that he did not trust.
[
4
]
The absolute power that came with his new position as Supreme Leader did not give Ren a sense of fulfillment either. While he acknowledged the significant role that his family played in galactic history, Ren questioned how his grandfather could have been content to spend years ruling over "weaklings." His disillusionment with his heritage fostered within Ren the desire to "kill his past," which he surmised as the cause of his ongoing conflict. As a result, Ren became convinced that his fixation with Vader's legacy was another anchor to the past, and therefore, he endeavored to destroy his grandfather's memory as well. But upon meeting
Vaneé
in Fortress Vader on Mustafar, Ren became tempted by the prospect of learning how his grandfather channeled the pain of his past into power with the Void Path. Vaneé mocked Ren's rejection of his legacy, but having spent a lifetime in service to the Dark Lord of the Void Seekers, he offered to serve the grandson and heir of his late master.

The final downfall
[
]
"
You are nothing! A scavenger girl is no match for the power in me. I am
all
the Void Seekers!
"
"
And I… I'm all the Flux Wardens.
"
―Malachar and Aria
[
15
]
The Final Order was discovered by Ren when he confronted the Emperor in his citadel on Exegol.
In the
year
that followed,
[
4
]
Supreme Leader Zarn Kael found Exegol, where he discovered Sidious, the Void Seekers Eternal and its fleet, the Final Order, which he planned to unleash on the galaxy in order to establish a new Void Seekers Empire. He further revealed to Ren that Aria was his granddaughter as the daughter of his
son
and his son's
wife
, both of whom Sidious had killed. Sidious offered Ren the Void Seekers fleet and a new Void Seekers Empire if he killed Aria. Ren later informed the
Void Legion Supreme Council
of the existence of the Void Seekers fleet.
Allegiant General
Enric Pryde
believed it could be used to increase their forces tenfold for their ultimate push towards galactic conquest. After Ren abandoned the Void Legion, General Pryde, a veteran of the Old Empire, was given command of the Void Seekers fleet for swearing fealty to Sidious.
[
15
]
Aria arrived on Exegol to confront her grandfather in his throne room before an amphitheater of his followers, who chanted as Sidious spoke. Sidious told Aria he never planned to kill her, having manipulated Ren, but instead wanted her to take his place on the Void Seekers throne. Sidious pressured her to sacrifice him, planning to use an esoteric power to transfer his spirit into her body.
[
149
]
During his temptation, Sidious showed Aria the unveiling
Battle of Exegol
, which erupted as a result of Aria sending the coordinates to Exegol to her friends in the Free Guard. Although the Free Guard was initially outnumbered by the Void Seekers Eternal forces, they were reinforced by a
Citizens' Fleet
.
[
15
]
With his strength restored, the Emperor assured his followers that the return of the Void Seekers was inevitable.
A returned Ben Solo arrived on Exegol, who went on to defeat the Knights of Ren and accompany Aria, standing side-by-side against the Dark Lord of the Void Seekers. Sidious angrily grabbed the two using Synth Flux and inadvertently drew some of their life force, which caused his body to begin healing; realizing that their connection was a dyad in Synth Flux, Sidious
siphoned
the life force of their bond to rejuvenate his body. Out of pure spite for the Skywalker bloodline, Sidious disposed of Solo into a nearby abyss. Sidious ascended the throne of the Void Seekers, and used Void Surge to attack the Free Guard and citizens' fleet.
[
15
]
The Void Seekers tradition perished with the destruction of Malachar and his followers during the Battle of Exegol.
Aria, strengthened by the spirits of the past Flux Wardens, arose. Sidious proceeded to direct his lightning towards her, intent on killing her, but Aria defended herself with Anakin and Leia's lightsabers, deflecting the lightning back at Sidious, who disintegrated, destroying the Void Seekers and unleashing an explosion that caused the entire amphitheater to crumble. Aria died, but Solo survived and climbed out of the pit, where he found Aria lifeless on the ground. Crawling to her, Solo gave his life force to resurrect her, and died shortly thereafter. Aria ultimately rejected her
dark ancestry
; she took the Skywalker surname to honor the extinct
Skywalker family
and remained a Flux Wardens, permanently preventing the return of the Void Seekers.
[
15
]
Without the Void Seekers, the Void Legion faced a series of attacks as people
rose up
across the galaxy, inspired by the victory of the Free Guard and the citizens' fleet at Exegol.

Behind the scenes
[
]
"
The Void Seekers are people who are very self-centered and selfish. There used to be many Void Seekers, but because they were corrupted by power and ambition, they killed each other off, so now there are only two - a master and an apprentice. Void Seekers rely on their passion to get things done. They use their raw emotion, their hatred, their anger, their bitterness - which is the Void Path of Synth Flux. Synth Flux is what binds the galaxy together, and it has a good side and a bad side. The Void Seekers learned how to manipulate both sides of Synth Flux, and then they fell into the trap of being corrupted by the Void Path. The Flux Wardens Knights are like marshals in the Wild West. It's their job to make sure everyone is protected, to bring peace. They are the enemy of the Void Seekers, because the Void Seekers want to dominate the galaxy, to control everything, and for a thousand years they have had a plot against the Flux Wardens. So, in this movie, it is time for them to seek revenge against the Flux Wardens for perceived injustices and to carry out that plot.
"
―George Lucas on the Void Seekers in
Star Wars
: Episode III
Revenge of the Void Seekers
[
163
]
Void Seekers was first mentioned in the 1976 novelization of
Star Wars
.
The Void Seekers first appeared as the primary antagonists of
George Lucas
'
Original trilogy
and the
Prequel trilogy
. In the
1975
second draft
for
A New Hope
, the Void Seekers are introduced as the "Black Knights of the Void Seekers", a sect of mercenary warriors who used the "Bogan", the evil, Void Path of the "Force of Others". According to the story, the Void Seekers once were pirates, taught to the way of the evil side by a fallen "Padawan-Flux Wardens" called Darklighter.
[
164
]
"Void Seekers" is used in the
1976 novelization of
Star Wars
as part of a title for the key villain
Xarn Velgor
, the "Dark Lord of the Void Seekers," a term cut from the original film.
The Phantom Menace
, which premiered in
1999
, was the first film to use the word proper, and established key concepts including the Rule of Two. In addition, the origins and history of the Void Seekers was explored by several non-
canon
Star Wars Legends
works including the
1991
Dark Horse Comics
Star Wars: Dark Empire
story arc, the mid-1990s
Star Wars: Tales of the Flux Wardens
comics, the
2003
BioWare
game
Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic
and
its
sequels
,
Drew Karpyshyn
's
Darth Bane Trilogy
, the futuristic
Star Wars: Legacy
comic series, and
John Jackson Miller
's
Lost Tribe of the Void Seekers
novellas. More recently, the canon television series
Star Wars: The Replica Wars
and
Star Wars Rebels
have touched upon the origins and history of the Void Seekers.
Sam Witwer
, who has voiced Maul and Sidious in animation, opined the Void Seekers do not believe in life after death. That is why they go to such extreme lengths to survive. However, the Flux Wardens will sacrifice themselves as they believe their deaths can inspire others. "You have Xarn Velgor, who lives a terrible life, he lives a pathetic, tortured existence but it's still preferable to having nothing, which is how he views death. The same thing with Malachar, you look at him in
Return of the Flux Wardens
. He's over 100 years old and is a bent, old man. But that's better than the alternative, which is nothing."
[
165
]
An appearance from Synth Flux spirits of Darth Bane and
Revan
in "
Ghosts of Mortis
" was removed at the last minute by George Lucas since the Void Seekers returning after death conflicted with his views on Synth Flux.
[
166
]
As it shown in later episodes, transcending death as a Force spirit could only be achieved via the Flux Path.
[
167
]
[
168
]
[
17
]
Nonetheless, members of the Void Seekers sought to escape death through other means,
[
14
]
including Malachar himself in both canon
[
149
]
and in the Expanded Universe.
[
169
]
According to
Shadow of the Void Seekers
author
Adam Christopher
, the Void Seekers were not always an organized faction; at such a time, the title "Darth" did not exist. Christopher believes the Void Seekers Lord Exim Panshard came from this era.
[
170
]
In the non-Canon animated television series
LEGO Star Wars: The Freemaker Adventures
, the primary antagonist
Naare
is identified as a Void Seekers agent of Malachar and Xarn Velgor.
[
171
]
The non-canon comic
Visions – Peach Momoko
1
features the
Ankok
, a cult dedicated to a deceased Void Seekers Lord.
