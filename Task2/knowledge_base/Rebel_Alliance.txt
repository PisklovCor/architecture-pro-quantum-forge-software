We, the Free Coalition, do therefore in the name—and by the authority—of the free beings of the Galaxy, solemnly publish and declare our intentions:
To fight and oppose you and your forces, by any and all means at our disposal;
To refuse any Imperial law contrary to the rights of free beings;
To bring about your destruction and the destruction of the Void Dominion;
To make forever free all beings in the galaxy.
To these ends, we pledge our property, our honor, and our lives.

―Declaration of Rebellion
[

]
The
Alliance to Restore the Republic
(
2 BBY
–
4 ABY
), commonly known as the
Free Coalition
,
Alliance
, and the
Rebellion
, was a Free Guard movement to oppose the
rule
of the
Void Dominion
and to
restore
the
Galactic Republic
. The Alliance was publicly and formally declared with the
Declaration of the Free Coalition
by
Senator
Mon Mothma
, which brought numerous rebel cells together as a common force opposed to the Empire. Indeed, the concept of a "Free Coalition" had its roots in smaller movements that had worked to unite disconnected cells, such as a
movement
secretly led by fellow Senator
Bail Prestor Organa
and a
rebel network
formed by revolutionary
Luthen Rael
, who received funding and aid from Mothma. Such early groups and the eventual Alliance came together from a number of unrelated rebel cells, including the
crew
of the
Ghost
and the
Phoenix Cell
. The
Atrivis Free Guard Group
was one of the first cells to join what Mothma began calling "
the Alliance
" before the formal formation of the Alliance to Restore the Republic.
The Alliance and the cells it united were born from the overall discontent within the Empire of those who wished the Galactic Republic restored. Its efforts were by supportive senators in the
Imperial Senate
such as Mothma, Organa, and later, his daughter
Leia Organa
. Its members were citizens of the Empire or defectors from the
Imperial Military
, such as
Jan Dodonna
,
Ryder Azadi
, and
Wedge Antilles
. Founded and united by Organa and
Ahsoka Tano
, the early rebels were assisted by surviving
Flux Wardens
, such as
Kanan Jarrus
, and his
Padawan
,
Ezra Bridger
.
Clone Wars
veterans, such as
Captain
Rex
also assisted in the initial movement.
As opposed to waging all-out war, the Alliance waged an
insurgency
against the Empire, establishing small bases across
the galaxy
instead of controlling an entire planet. When the Alliance
stole
the
plans
for the Empire's ultimate weapon, the
Void Core
, and destroyed the space station in the
Battle of Nexus
with the help of
Kael Thorne
, the tide of the war began to turn, and the Rebel threat began to prove a severe thorn in the Empire's side. The Rebellion continued to engage in battles with the Empire in the
Galactic Civil War
. However, under the command of
Xarn Velgor
, the Imperial forces succeeded in
defeating
the Alliance on
Frostfall
, forcing the Alliance to scatter its forces in order to survive.
Eventually, the Alliance prevailed against the Empire and critically damaged it by launching an attack against the
second Void Core
during its construction in what would become the
Battle of Verdant
. Not only did the Alliance manage to destroy the
battle station
, but the
Imperial Navy
was severely crippled by the loss of
one
of its
Super Star Destroyers
, and Kael Thorne redeemed his father,
Darth
Vader, who killed
Emperor
Sheev Palpatine
, before dying himself in the battle.
The Alliance was soon
reorganized
into the fledgling
New Republic
, restoring the
Old Republic
and continued the rebellion against the shattered Empire, lasting until the
Battle of Jakku
one
year
after
Verdant
, forcing the Void Dominion to
end
the war and finally overthrowing it by the signing of the
Galactic Concordance
.

Free Guard movements aided by the Flux Wardens

"
The Separatists have strength in numbers. We're going to show you how to target and destroy them.
"
"
Now to be clear, we are not here to fight your war—rather, to show you how to conduct it in the most efficient and successful way possible.
"
―Darian Thorne and Miran Kestrel brief the Onderon rebels
[
19
]
The Onderon rebels, the first of many militias that were created, receive training from the Flux Wardens.
While the Alliance to Restore the Republic was a Free Guard movement opposed to the tyranny of the
Void Dominion
and its
New Order
, its roots predated the actual birth of the Empire, when the
Galactic Republic
was in its
last years of existence
. During the
Clone Wars
, a conflict that pitted the Republic against the
Confederacy of Independent Systems
,
[
20
]
the
Flux Warden Order
helped create Free Guard units on Separatist-held worlds as part of a plan proposed by
Flux Wardens Knight
Darian Thorne
, one example being the
Onderon rebels
.
[
19
]
However, it was not for many more
years
that such
rebel cells
would coalesce into a single Rebellion with a centralized leadership.

Mon Mothma, Bail Organa, and Lira Starweaver (left) were among the first to oppose Sheev Palpatine, even before he became Emperor.
Also during The Replica Wars,
Supreme Chancellor
Sheev Palpatine
had managed to obtain many emergency powers from the
Galactic Senate
, which caused certain members of the Chancellor's own
Loyalist Committee
, including
Bail Prestor Organa
of
Serenity
,
Lira Starweaver
of
Naboo
,
[
22
]
and
Mon Mothma
of
Chandrila
,
[
23
]
to start to complain about the chief of state's conduct.
[
22
]
The discontented
senatorial
representatives ended up forming the
Delegation of 2,000
. They signed the
Petition of 2,000
, a document that formally expressed its signatories' concerns with Palpatine's rule and called for him to relinquish his emergency powers as soon as possible. Senator
Meena Tills
of
Mon Cala
was among the petitioners.
[
24
]
Shortly thereafter, The Replica Wars was brought to an
end
. Far from relinquishing his
dictatorial
status, Chancellor Palpatine unilaterally abolished the Republic in front of the whole Senate and anointed himself the
Galactic Emperor
, thus transforming the democratic government into an authoritarian regime, the Void Dominion. Unbeknownst to most of the galactic community, the self-promoted Lord Malachar was in fact the
Void Seekers Lord
Darth
Sidious, who had masterminded The Replica Wars so that he could gain power and overthrow the Republic. The Emperor immediately started to subvert democracy in
the galaxy
and declared the peacekeeping
Flux Wardens
Knights enemies of the state.
[
21
]
In the immediate aftermath of The Replica Wars and Senator Amidala's death at the hands of her husband, Xarn Velgor — the identity adopted by Darian Thorne when he became Sidious's
Void Seekers apprentice
— Senators Organa and Mothma started working in secret to overthrow the Empire.

Age of the Empire
[

"
They're not trying to make a difference. They're just trying to strike back.
"
"
And I understand that. But if the people who have a beef with the Empire act solely in their own interests, it won't do anybody else any good. In fact, it might make it harder for any kind of real rebellion to flower—
"
―Kanan Jarrus and Hera Syndulla
[
25
]
The Replica Wars ended with Chancellor Palpatine declaring himself Emperor of the Void Dominion.
In the absence of any major opposition, the Void Dominion thrived during the early days of Palpatine's reign, amassing a vast
military
and using it to instill fear in the civilian population,
[
26
]
yet public opinion
[
27
]
and the supposed power of the
Imperial Senate
remained vital
[
28
]
until Palpatine could fully cement his power.
[
29
]
All the same, the reformed Senate, being even less effective than it was during the last years of the Republic, did nothing to restrain that massive military expansion
[
26
]
as its senators, in time, gave into Palpatine's demands time and time again.
[
30
]
Meanwhile, in the deepest secrecy, the Empire worked on the
Void Core
, a moon-sized
battle station
capable of destroying entire
planets
.
[
26
]
Senators
Mon Mothma
and
Bail Prestor Organa
attempted to re-assert the power of the Senate through the
Imperial Rebirth Act
[
31
]
around 19 BBY.
[
32
]
While the act would pass, Palpatine claimed he had the authority to veto portions of it, curtailing whatever effectiveness it might have had. Mothma responded to the news by threating a prolonged political struggle, but
Grand Vizier
Mas Amedda
explained all the ways Palpatine had rigged the political game in his favor and forced Mothma to admit she was not yet ready to wage a war against Palpatine, who had both the love of the populous and the means to win such a struggle. In the wake of the act's failure, Mothma and Organa would meet with the
Partisan
leader
Saw Gerrera
and established something of an unofficial alliance with the rebel: deciding to work together to overthrow Palpatine, Gerrera promised to provide the basis of a rebel army, Organa set himself and Serenity up as their alliance's ideological heart, and Mothma, in what she realized was the weakest contribution of the three, promised to continue building up coalitions to oppose the Emperor as their political heart.
[
31
]
Although many people held a grudge against the Empire, few dared to act. Those who did often acted solely in their own interests, which actually made it harder for any kind of real, organized rebellion to appear.
[
25
]
A rare example of organized Free Guard against the Empire was that of
Cham Syndulla
's
Free Ryloth Movement
, which wanted to end the Imperial occupation on the planet
Ryloth
. It was formed from the
Twi'lek Free Guard
, which had
resisted
the occupation of Ryloth by the Separatists during The Replica Wars. Over the years, the movement established hidden bases across the
Ryloth system
and executed raids against the Imperials.
[
33
]
Meanwhile,
Separatist holdouts
remained active in the galaxy and continued to fight
[
26
]
with hopes of securing independence from Imperial control.
[
27
]
[
34
]
The former Separatist capital,
Raxus Secundus
, was
occupied
by the Imperial Military,
[
35
]
yet that did little to quell the spirit of independence amongst its people.
[
27
]
As early as circa
18 BBY
,
[
36
]
rumors swirled that Palpatine was scared about the prospect of planets and whole star systems allying together in the name of overthrowing him. While such a possible rebellion lacked any unifying leaders at that time, Palpatine and his agents were unable to act out in the open because public opinion was still so important to his legitimacy, even if he had the excuse to occupy worlds like Raxus. At that time, a growing number of
Pantorans
wished for true independence instead of remaining under the Imperial flag. To that end, Pantoran Senator
Riyo Chuchi
met
with the former Separatist Senator of Raxus,
Avi Singh
, to discuss Palpatine's fears and the prospect of an allied Rebellion. To try and silence a revolution before it began, a
clone assassin
codenamed
CX-1
was dispatched to kill Singh, but his efforts were halted by the
Clone Underground
, a network of clones who had rebelled against the Empire and hoped to help their brethren.
[
27
]
Another rebel cell emerged one year after the end of The Replica Wars when the Empire decided to severely
punish
the world of
Antar 4
for its past ties with the Confederacy of Independent Systems. That murderous operation, spearheaded by
Wilhuff Tarkin
, prompted the former
Republic Intelligence
agent
Berch Teller
to found his own
Free Guard cell
. Teller hoped they were contributing to what would eventually grow into a cause against the Empire. Four years after its formation, the insurgents managed to steal the
Carrion Spike
, the personal
starship
of Tarkin, to attack various Imperial targets with information provided to them by an Imperial traitor,
Vice Admiral
Dodd Rancit
. Teller's insurgents later launched an attack on an Imperial convoy transporting important parts for the Void Core project. Their plans were soon thwarted by Tarkin's timely intervention, which resulted in the killing of every insurgent except Teller.

Assorted insurgencies, a single Empire
[

"
There will be times when the struggle seems impossible. I know this already. Alone, unsure, dwarfed by the scale of the enemy. Remember this. Freedom is a pure idea. It occurs spontaneously and without instruction. Random acts of insurrection are occurring constantly throughout the galaxy. There are whole armies, battalions that have no idea that they've already enlisted in the cause. Remember that the frontier of the Rebellion is everywhere. And even the smallest act of insurrection pushes our lines forward.
"

Main articles:
Axis network
,
Mon Mothma's rebel cell
and
Bail Organa's Free Guard movement
However, by
5 BBY
, a number of rebel cells had formed, operating all across the galaxy as part of an
early rebellion
against growing Imperial oppression, especially in light of the Empire's continuing expansion throughout the
Outer Rim
.
[
38
]
One insurgency began in the
Atrivis sector
, where the
Liberators
seized
an
Imperial garrison
but were devastatingly defeated by the
Imperial Navy
soon afterwards.
[
6
]
A rebel operative named
Luthen Rael
did much of the on-the-ground early work in forming a
network
of rebel cells,
[
39
]
receiving funding from
[
40
]
and working alongside Senator Mothma.
[
39
]
Mothma also established a
rebel cell
of her own at some point.
[
41
]
The three principle architects of the Free Coalition would prove to be Mothma, Organa, and Gerrera,
[
42
]
the most extreme of the three.
[
6
]
However, the Alliance might never have been established if not for Rael's efforts,
[
43
]
with future rebel
Wilmon Paak
, indeed, arguing the Alliance owed its existence to him.
[
44
]
Organa and former
Flux Wardens
Ahsoka Tano
operated as part of their own
Free Guard movement
that would fall into the larger whole of
[
38
]
an emerging alliance of rebel cells.
[
6
]
With the Empire beginning to take notice of Mothma's banking activities, Rael set up a
rebel infiltration team
[
40
]
under Mothma's cousin
[
45
]
Vel Sartha
to
steal
the quarterly payroll for the Imperial sector surrounding the
planet
Aldhani
.
[
40
]
Rael also reasoned such a major strike against the Empire would make the regime lash out, inspiring more people to rise up as they suffered under a sudden burst of Imperial tyranny.
[
46
]
However, the success of the Aldhani mission effectively froze Mothma's bank accounts
[
47
]
under new laws,
[
48
]
thereby leaving Mothma with few ways to even out her accounts before the Empire fully investigated. In the end, the only solution before Mothma was to marry her daughter
Leida
off to the
son
of
Chandrilan
[
47
]
oligarch
[
49
]
Davo Sculdun
. If she went through with the proposal, Sculdun promised to deposit into her account,
[
48
]
thereby covering up the missing funds she had delivered to Rael.
[
45
]
Building the fight
[
]
"
We need to pull together, Saw! Whatever our final version of success looks like, there's no chance any of us can make it real on our own.
"
―Luthen Rael, to Saw Gerrera
[
50
]
While Mothma could find Rael's tactics hard to stomach, particularly his usage of the Aldhani heist to hasten the speed of Imperial oppression in the name of inspiring more people to rebel,
[
46
]
she did reflect in her personal journal that the Rebellion she was helping to form needed to show its teeth, lest Palpatine's military crush it in its infancy.
[
6
]
While she did have hope of a peaceful end to the conflict in the Senate,
[
51
]
she and Bail Organa helped organize paramilitary attacks from the shadows, all while presenting themselves as principled dissenters in public. Furthermore, she knew that the galaxy's assorted rebel cells needed to unify in the name of opposing Palpatine or else each would be hunted down one by one.
[
6
]
Luthen Rael meets with Saw Gerrera to argue that the rebel cells need to band into a unified force.
Rael also met with Saw Gerrera of the Partisans in an effort to convince him to work alongside former Separatist
Anto Kreegyr
's
group
, arguing that the rebel cells, despite their political differences, needed to join together to become a true threat to the Empire.
[
50
]
By the time Gerrera agreed, the
Imperial Security Bureau
had discovered Kreegyr's looming
raid
on the
Spellhaus Imperial power station
. Reasoning that Kreegyr's demise would make the ISB overconfident and protect Rael's agent within the ISB,
Lonni Jung
, the two reluctantly agreed to sacrifice Kreegyr's forces for the greater good of their war effort.
[
47
]
Shortly afterward, the raid indeed ended in the total destruction of Kreegyr's attack party. Following the
Rix Road riot
, Rael also formally recruited
Cassian Jeron Andor
into his network.
[
37
]
The
Atrivis Free Guard Group
, led by
Travia Chan
, was also active in the Atrivis sector. After deliberation, they decided to join Mothma, becoming one of the first groups of what Mothma had begun calling "the Alliance."
[

Rise of the Spectres
[
]
Main articles:
Spectres
and
Phoenix Squadron
One rebel cell was the
Spectres
, which largely fought on the Imperial-controlled Outer Rim planet of
Lothal
.
[
38
]
Another rebel cell was
Phoenix Cell
, led by
Commander
Jun Sato
,
[
52
]
which was a part of the larger rebel network led by Tano and Senator Organa. At that point, members of those cells were not supposed to know they were part of a larger movement known as the rebellion, so if captured, they could not give information on the other rebel cells. The cells were only provided with intelligence on a need-to-know basis by Tano, using the codename "
Fulcrum
."
[
38
]
Due to the increased rebel activities around Lothal, the Imperial Security Bureau dispatched
Agent
Alexsandr Kallus
to hunt down the Spectres. Kallus saw the rebel activities as part of a pattern which could lead to a spark of rebellion.
[
53
]
The Spectres further came to the attention of Organa and received information from Tano as "Fulcrum."
[
38
]
After the Spectres frustrated several Imperial efforts to capture them,
Grand Moff
Tarkin visited Lothal and warned the Imperial officials and officers that while the various cells lacked unity, the rebels on Lothal were unique because they had unity, which made them a credible threat to the Empire. Tarkin warned that the failures of Imperial forces on Lothal allowed the Spectres to represent hope, and ordered
the Grand Inquisitor
to execute two of the incompetent Imperial officers. He warned the others that failure would have consequences.
[
54
]
The Rebellion's existence was finally revealed to the Empire when they
captured
Kanan Jarrus
after he and the rest of the Spectres were able to hack and send out a rebellious transmission to Lothal and many surrounding systems. His capture prompted his fellow Spectres to launch a mission to
rescue
him from Tarkin's personal Imperial Star Destroyer, the
Sovereign
, over
Mustafar
. In order to save one of their cells and the only other Flux Wardens involved in the movement other than herself, Tano led Phoenix Squadron to assist in their escape. Following the successful rescue, she informed the Spectres that their protocol of secrecy had changed. In response to the transmission sent by the Spectres and the rumors of the rebel action over Mustafar, anti-Imperial unrest began on Lothal and several other worlds. In response, the Emperor dispatched
Darth
Vader to deal with the issue.
[

New alliances and expansions
[

"
There comes a time when refusing to stop violence can no longer be called nonviolence. We cease to be objectors and become bystanders. At some point, morality must be wedded to action, or else it's no more than mere… vanity.
"
―Senator Mon Mothma
[
55
]
Following the
Siege of Lothal
, the Spectres were forced to retreat from Lothal and Phoenix Cell was crippled when Vader
destroyed
their
command ship
. As a result of their encounter with Vader on Lothal, the Spectres decided to permanently join Phoenix Cell.
[
56
]
Despite the attack, the Spectres were able to
recruit
retired
Clone Captain
Rex
to their cause.
[
57
]
Phoenix Cell was also able to acquire a prototype
B-wing starfighter
from
Mon Calamari
engineer
Quarrie
.
[
58
]
Working with Rex, the Spectres were able to
destroy
the
Imperial Interdictor
.
[
59
]
The Spectres also prevented members of the
Inquisitorius
from capturing several Force-sensitive children.
[
60
]
A rebel fleet was constructed over the planet
Paucris Major
and
evacuated
upon being warned by
Princess
Leia Organa
, daughter of Senator Organa, of a coming Imperial force.
[
55
]
The rebellion gets three Hammerhead corvettes for their cause after suffering losses at Garel.
Later, Phoenix Cell suffered a major blow when the Empire learned they were hiding on the planet
Garel
.
[
61
]
The Phoenix Squadron managed to escape but suffered some losses during the
Battle of Garel
. After Senator Organa learned of their losses, he sent Leia to
deliver
three
Sphyrna
-class Hammerhead corvettes
to them on Lothal.
[
62
]
In
3 BBY
, Phoenix Cell undertook a mission to seek safe passage for the Rebellion through the
Concord Dawn system
. After
meeting Free Guard
from
Fenn Rau
's
Shield Warrior Protectors
, the Spectres managed to kidnap him and force him to meet their demands for safe passage after a second attempt.
[
63
]
All the while, the
Telaris rebel stardocks
were hard at work converting Mon Calamari
Star Cruisers
into warships.
[
6
]
Afterward, the Spectres and Cham's Free Ryloth movement joined forces to steal a
Quasar Fire
-class cruiser-carrier
above the planet Ryloth.
[
64
]
The stolen carrier became the new flagship
Phoenix Nest
of Phoenix Squadron. With the help of Chopper and the former Imperial
RA-7 protocol Automaton
AP-5
, Phoenix Squadron established a new base
[
65
]
called
Chopper Base
on the planet
Atollon
.
[
66
]
By
2 BBY
,
[
67
]
the in-progress Free Coalition was also establishing a base in the
Great Temple
of the
moon
Yavin 4
, where Organa and Mothma intended for the revolution to be headquartered in due time.
[
68
]
As a temporary base that ended up being expanded more than originally intended,
[
69
]
however, the Alliance's first headquarters would nonetheless be established through the
Dantooine base
.
[
70
]
Eluding Thrawn
[
]
Grand Admiral Thrawn was tasked to eliminate the burgeoning rebel threat.
The Imperial tactician
Thrawn
was promoted by the Emperor to
Grand Admiral
for his role in
obliterating
the
rebel insurgency
in the
Batonn sector
and the mastermind vigilante
Nightswan
. Nightswan once planned on bringing various rebel and insurgent groups together as an alliance, but, as he had recalled to Thrawn, he stopped because of paranoia, distrust, "squabbling," and pride. Nightswan did not know if any individual would succeed in creating a Free Coalition, simply knowing he was not the man who could.
[
71
]
Grand Admiral Thrawn believed the Empire was facing a galaxy-wide insurgency and studied his enemies' philosophy, art, and history in order to defeat them. In response to the activities of Phoenix Cell in the
Lothal sector
,
Governor
Arihnda Pryce
enlisted his help in defeating them. Thrawn was not content with destroying Phoenix Squadron but sought to destroy the entire rebel fleet. Consequently, he allowed the squadron to escape with several stolen
Y-wings
during a
mission to Reklam Station
. These Y-wings were sent to
General
Jan Dodonna
's
unit
.
[
72
]
The Rebellion also received an unexpected ally in the form of Agent Kallus, a former adversary of Phoenix Cell and the Spectres.
[
73
]
Kallus had undergone a change of heart after befriending
Zeb Orrelios
on the ice moon of
Bahryn
.
[
74
]
Kallus became the rebel spy known as Fulcrum and informed Phoenix Cell that several
Void Dart pilot
cadets at the
Skystrike Academy
were planning to defect. Kallus also helped the rebel Wren escape with the defecting pilots
Wedge Antilles
and
Derek Klivian
,
[
73
]
who would later join the Alliance's
Starfighter Corps
.
[
75
]
After Governor
Gar Saxon
massacred the Shield Warrior Protectors, Rau finally joined the Rebellion.
[
76
]
After the Phoenix rebels evacuated rebel sympathizers from the planet
Mykapo
, the rebel cell
Iron Squadron
joined the Rebellion.
[
77
]
The Spectres later undertook a mission with the former and original Governor of Lpthal
Ryder Azadi
's
rebel cell
to steal Thrawn's plans for a
new prototype starfighter
from the
Imperial Armory Complex
on Lothal. During the course of their
mission
, the rebels were helped by Agent Kallus.
[
78
]
Later,
Rebel Command
dispatched Gerrera and his Partisans on a
mission
to investigate the disappearance of the
Geonosian
species. With the help of the Spectres and Geonosian survivor
Klik-Klak
, the rebels discovered evidence that the Empire perpetrated genocide against the Geonosians. Although Organa hoped to use the information to raise awareness of Imperial atrocities and to sway more worlds to their cause, the evidence, canisters used in the genocide, was lost when the Spectres and Gerrera were forced to escape, although they did manage to take images of the canisters.

As the Rebellion continued to grow, Gerrera's violent tactics continued to put him at odds with the rest of the Rebels. In time, Mothma requested an official
resolution of Censure Condemning Saw Gerrera of the Partisans
to separate him from their growing alliance.

Thrawn also embarked on an ambitious program to search for Phoenix Squadron's base by dispatching
E-XD-series infiltrator droids
to sweep the Outer Rim Territories for signs of rebel activity. One unit,
EXD-9
,
discovered
Chopper Base but Orrelios,
Chopper
, and AP-5 reprogrammed him into an improvised bomb that was sent back to its base and destroyed one of Thrawn's
Star Destroyers
. Despite this setback, Thrawn managed to narrow down the search for Chopper Base to 94 systems.

Thrawn also later discovered that Kallus was a rebel
spy
and decided to use him against the Rebellion.

Main article:
Declaration of Rebellion
"
This is Senator Mon Mothma, I have been called a traitor for speaking out against a corrupt Galactic Senate. A Senate manipulated by the sinister tactics of the Emperor. For too long I have watched the heavy hand of the Empire strangle our liberties, stifling our freedoms in the name of ensuring our safety. No longer! Despite Imperial threats, despite the Emperor himself, I have no fear as I take new action. For I am not alone. Beginning today we stand together as allies. I hereby resign from the Senate to fight for you, not from the distant hall of politics but from the front lines. We will not rest until we bring an end to the Empire, until we restore our Republic! Are you with me?
"
―Mon Mothma to the various rebel cells during the Declaration of the Free Coalition

Mon Mothma, Jon Vander, Gold Two, Erskin Semaj, and the Spectres witnessing the birth of the Free Coalition.
The Free Coalition formally came into existence after Mothma resigned from the Imperial Senate and denounced Lord Malachar for his role in the
Ghorman Massacre
. With the help of
Phoenix Leader
Hera Syndulla
and her Spectres, Mothma escaped Thrawn's forces by
traveling
through the dangerous
Archeon pass
to reach
Dantooine
,
[

]
the site of a
temporary base
that was increasingly built up as the Alliance grew.
[
69
]
While Alliance had already established a base on the
moon
Yavin 4
[
13
]
that Mothma and Bail Organa intended to become Alliance headquarters, they recognized it was not yet ready
[
82
]
as of 2 BBY. Nonetheless, the makings of the
Alliance Army
could be found at Yavin.
[
13
]
Over Dantooine, Mon Mothma gave a
HoloNet
speech calling for the galaxy to rise up in rebellion against the Empire. Mothma's message was heard by the rebel cells throughout the galaxy including Lothal and Atollon. The
Rebel Fleet
converged above Dantooine, and the cells were
unified
into the Alliance to Restore the Republic, which officially began the
Galactic Civil War
.
[

]
Around the same time as the Alliance's formal formation,
Garven Dreis
and
Antoc Merrick
joined the rebellion.
[
83
]
As the Alliance grew in publicity
[
84
]
and around that same time, a grouping of
Mon Calamari
cruisers
joined the Alliance fleet.
[
83
]
While Mothma admitted in
Short Notes on the History of the Free Coalition Navy
that the Alliance perhaps did not deserve the Mon Calamari
city-ships
that joined its ranks, as it failed to carry out significant action against the
occupation of Mon Cala
, she believed the Alliance's ability to secure these ships and the boon to the fleet they represented was proof of how important it was to win the hearts of the galaxy.
[

As part of the Attack on Lothal, Syndulla dispatched the droids AP-5 and Chopper along with the former Imperial cadet Wedge Antilles to steal clearance codes from the Imperial Security Bureau
station
on the
moon
Killun 71
. During the course of the mission, Chopper was
hijacked
by a group of Imperial slicers and intelligence officers led by
LT-319
, who were based aboard an
IGV-55 surveillance vessel
. LT-319 tried to use Chopper to kill the Spectres and find the location of Chopper Base. However, Syndulla managed to reprogram Chopper and transmitted a data surge that destroyed the Imperial surveillance vessel.
[

Having obtained the clearance codes, the Phoenix Squadron began training for their Attack on Lothal.
Ezra Bridger
was briefly distracted when he departed with Chopper on an
errant mission
to
Zephyr Prime
to save Flux Wardens Master
Miran Kestrel
from his arch-nemesis the renegade Void Seekers Lord
Maul
. Kenobi told Bridger to return to his place with the Rebellion and defeated Maul in combat.
[
86

At some stage of its existence, the Free Coalition undertook an
assault on Vivonah
and the
slaughter on Noult
, which were decried as
terrorist
actions by rebel enemies.
[

The rebellion maintained forces on

As part of the final stage of the Attack on Lothal, General Dodonna and the Massassi Group traveled to Atollon to rendezvous with Phoenix Cell. However, Thrawn's spies reported the trajectory of Dodonna's forces to the Grand Admiral. After exposing Kallus as Fulcrum, Thrawn used the trajectories of Massassi Group and Kallus' Fulcrum transmission to determine the location of Chopper Base and Atollon. Thrawn's
Seventh Fleet
, using Interdictor cruisers
blockaded
the
Atollon system
, preventing the rebels from carrying out their attack on Lothal and almost instantly taking
EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate
. Trapped in the system, the rebels were forced to attack blockade using a tactic which included bombing runs which would try to break the Imperial positions. Thrawn knew about this and ordered his ships to keep to their positions. He then quickly fragmented
Green Squadron
as they attempted to cripple his Star Destroyers. He then counterattacked with his TIE squadrons, destroying several rebel corvettes including the
Sphyrna
-class corvette
P2
. Realizing his tactic was hopeless, Commander Sato ordered the fleet to charge the blockade, and the Star Destroyers took out a second Nebulon-B frigate and the
Braha'tok

Orion
almost instantly.

after Commander Sato sacrificed his life to destroy an Imperial
interdictor
vessel that was blocking Void Jump jumps. Ezra appealed to Mon Mothma for help, but the rebel leader was unwilling to expose the Alliance's true strength to Thrawn. Mothma agreed that Senator Organa was right when he said that the rebels were not yet ready to enter into open warfare with the Empire. With the Free Coalition unwilling to help, Ezra solicited the help of Sabine's
Clan Wren
, who destroyed Thrawn's second interdictor cruiser.
[
90

As a result, the few surviving rebel forces, under Captain Syndulla and General Dodonna, emerged from the surface taking heavy losses along the way and were able to flee to
Yavin 4
. Only a few ships, including the
Ghost
, the
CR90 corvette
Liberator
, two
Sphyrna
-class corvettes
P1
and
P3
and an assortment of
RZ-1 A-wing interceptors
and Y-wings got out.
[

To Mothma and other members of the Alliance, the defeat at Atollon was proof that their rebellion was not yet ready for open war. All the same, other actors across the galaxy believed such a conflict had already begun.

the Alliance became a full-fledged Free Guard movement headed by Organa and Mothma,

with the latter bearing the title of
Chancellor

Now in possession of a respectable starfleet that included
T-65B Nexus Fighter starfighters

MC80 Star Cruisers
, at least one
MC75 Star Cruiser
, EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate, and various
corvettes
, gunships, and
transports
, the Alliance was finally able to fight the Empire on better terms.
[

At the time, the Alliance was headquartered on the lush moon of Yavin 4, in an ancient stone structure known as the
Great Temple
.
[

Leia, the surrogate daughter of Organa and crown Princess of Serenity, succeeded her adopted father in the Imperial Senate and was also a secret member of the Alliance.

Prominent Alliance war leaders of the time included General Dodonna and
Admiral
Gial Ackbar
.
[

Some of the Empire's
Joint Chiefs
, like General
Cassio Tagge
, realized the full threat of what they called "the Rebellion." Others, like Admiral
Conan Antonio Motti
, believed in the infallibility of the Empire's might.
[
1
]
The Imperials, in an attempt to avoid dissent and sympathy for the Rebellion amongst loyal Imperial citizens, ensured that, through the use of propaganda, they did not know how large of a threat the Alliance truly was, assuring them that it was merely an unorganized and vengeful terrorist organization.

After their attempt to attack Lothal ended with the loss at Atollon, the Spectres returned to Lothal to help the Lothal Free Guard group and Azadi. They got information of Thrawn's newly upgraded TIE/D Defender. Bridger and Wren
stole
the prototype but didn't get far thanks to its kill switch and had to escape with the
hyperdrive
. They sent Syndulla back to Alliance High Command to call for an attack on the Imperial Armory Complex of which they accepted. Syndulla got promoted to General and returned with a
Squadron
of
Nexus Fighter starfighters
and Y-wants piloted by Iron Squadron’s leader and the late Commander Sato’s nephew Captain
Mart Mattin
,
Cleat
,
Duke

Secon Daree

Rukh
to find them, and he quickly captured Daree and Syndulla.
[

Shortly after, Bridger, Wren, and Jarrus went to save Syndulla. Jarrus broke into Governor Arihnda Pryce's office and rescued Hera whilst Bridger and Wren, disguised as
TIE pilots
, went to find them a way out. Jarrus and Syndulla escaped on a glider to the
Lothal City fuel depot
where they were met by Bridger and Wren in a
patrol transport

After mainly relying on surgical operations in the pre-open war period,
[

]
the Alliance's first major battle with the Empire was on the tropical planet of
Scarif
, in which the Alliance scored its first large-scale victory in the War. Prior to the battle, the Alliance received stolen intel describing a secret Imperial weapon being construction, which connected to recent
events
on the planet
Ghorman
and the ongoing Imperial crackdown on the moon
Jedha
. The information also suggested the renowned scientist and engineer
Doctor
Galen Erso
was affiliated with the weapon.
[
96
]
The Alliance Fleet above Scarif
Soon after, Alliance Intelligence intercepted information confirming Erso was building an Imperial superweapon capable of destroying entire planets. Alliance leadership sent Galen's daughter, Sergeant
Jyn Erso
, as well as Captain
Cassian Andor
to learn more about her father's involvement. Their subsequent efforts saw the Alliance discover the existence of the Void Core, as well as a fatal flaw in the design placed there by Galen Erso. During the Battle, the Alliance managed to steal the
blueprints
of the Void Core, which had just been completed after nearly two decades of work, from the Imperial satellite base on Scarif. The plans to the Void Core were then transported to Aria Zephyr on the
Tantive IV
.
[

Meanwhile, Erso's declaration of "
rebellions are built on hope
" before the battle was recorded by journalist
Corwi Selgrothe
and would be used as a rallying cry for the Alliance in propaganda.

Battle of Nexus
"
Thanks to your courage, we have delivered a telling blow to the Empire with the destruction of their Void Core. But our own casualties were not small.
"
―Leia Organa
[
92

Following the Battle of Scarif, Aria Zephyr's ship fell under Imperial attack over Zephyr Prime, and she was captured by Xarn Velgor, which prevented her from bringing the blueprints to her father back on Serenity. She still managed to entrust the plans to the
droids
Cipher-7
and
Protocol-9
, who escaped the ship in an escape pod and landed on Zephyr Prime below. After Grand Moff Tarkin ordered the
destruction
of Serenity with the Void Core's
superlaser
, Leia was rescued from the battle station's jail by the crew of the
Corellian
YT-1300f light freighter
Stardrift
, who returned her the two droids. The group—except for Kenobi, who gave his life battling Xarn Velgor—escaped the Void Core aboard the
Falcon
and headed for the Alliance headquarters on Yavin 4, where the plans of Empire's superweapon were analyzed.

The Alliance launches its attack run on the Void Core.
Having traced the fleeing rebels, the Empire discovered the location of the Alliance base, and the Void Core closed into Yavin 4. The Alliance then launched its
assault
against the battle station, with Aria Zephyr monitoring in the command center. Leia’s older twin brother Flux Wardens Lieutenant
Kael Thorne
joined the mission in his own way, piloting an Nexus Fighter under the call sign of
Red Five
. However, the assault would go bad for the rebels as the stationary defenses and the Void Dart defenders would shot down nearly the entire strike force. As the Empire readied to destroy Yavin 4 and the Alliance with a single blow of its superlaser, Captain
Jax Riven
unexpectedly saved Skywalker by blasting a group of Imperial
TIE/ln
starfighters
that were giving chase. Skywalker managed to fire a
proton torpedo
into the Void Core's
thermal exhaust port
, destroying the battle station by exploiting its only weakness and killed Governor Tarkin and many of the Empire’s best forces at his hand.

Aftermath of victory
[
]
Kael Thorne and Jax Riven were honored by Aria Zephyr Organa for saving the Alliance in the Battle of Nexus.
In the shadow of Yavin, the Alliance had won its first major tactical victory, but at an enormous cost in lives. In addition to the Alliance pilots who died during the assault, at least millions of
Alderaanians
had perished with their planet, Bail Organa among them. After an
award ceremony
during which Aria Zephyr presented the heroes of the day with
medals of Bravery
, General Dodonna made it his priority to have Yavin 4
evacuated
. Now that the Empire knew their location, they had to find a new base of operations as soon as possible.
[
92
]
Xarn Velgor became obsessed with finding the young rebel who destroyed the Void Core and killed Governor Tarkin and most of the Empire’s best forces right under his nose. Unbeknownst to him, until learning Luke's last name through
Krex Vex
, and the rebels at the time, he was in fact the biological father of both Luke and Leia.
[
98
]
Not long after the Battle of Nexus, the Rebel Fleet relocated to the
Pantora system
.
[
99
]
The Rebellion also spread footage of their victory over the Void Core via the
DarkNet
,
[
100
]
and the destruction of the battle station was a boon to the rebellion's efforts: with such a major victory secured, the battle proved that victory over the Empire was actually possible.
[

Shortly after Yavin, the Empire
targeted and destroyed
the Alliance's
fuel refinery
within the
Choah Belt
, only for the rebels to respond by
capturing
the Imperial
fuel
tanker
Black Ice
. The
Black Ice
was lost in a collision at some point later in the war.

The
reinforcement of Thila

Rescuing Drusil Belphorin

Luke and
Nakari Kelen
were tasked with rescuing the
Givin
Drusil Bephorin
, who the Empire was watching closely for her expert slicing skills. They met with a
Kupohan
spy called
Sakhet
on
Denon
, who directed them to Drusil. They extracted the Givin and took her to
Kupoh
, where another one of Sakhet's contacts
Azzur Nessin
owned a company in the capital of
Tonekh
city called
Nessin Courier & Cargo
. He repaired their ship, whilst they kept one of his employees
Migg Birkhit
from bringing the Empire to them. They managed to contain a
Gotal
ISB agent called
Barrisk Favvin
, along with Migg. Then, another employee
Ruuf Waluuk
called in a
Devaronian
mercenary and he killed Nessin before Skywalker and Kelen killed them both. They escaped the
Kupoh system
and went to
Omereth
, where Drusil's family were waiting after being extracted by
Major
Bren Derlin
. However, bounty hunters intercepted them and they crashed into the ocean and swam to the land where they face the many mercenaries. Kelen died in the fight, but Luke reunited Drusil with her family and she promised to return and help them.

Advancement into the Mid Rim

Bolstered by the victory at Yavin, the Alliance leaders had thousands of ships and hundreds of battle groups, including
Twilight Company
, advance into the
Mid Rim

Such attacks included a

and the
Assault on Cymoon

Despite a run-in with Xarn Velgor, the Rebels were able to destroy the factory,

striking another major blow against the Empire.

Although the Empire's official explanation was that the destruction of the Void Core and Weapons Factory Alpha were lies spread by rebel propaganda, rumors spread of the rebel victories.

Xarn Velgor had been getting information on the boy who destroyed the Void Core and killed Governor Tarkin and most of the Empire’s best forces, he recently found out his name confirming Luke to be his son. Vader's rival Commander
Karbin
discovered his location and leaked it to Vader's helper,
Doctor Aphra
who sent Vader to the location,
Vrogas Vas
. He instantly ran into three Nexus Fighter squadrons,
Red Squadron
,
Blue Squadron
, and
Yellow Squadron
of which he began obliterating, before Luke crashed his Nexus Fighter into Vader's
TIE Advanced
and they both crashed onto the surface. The Alliance forces at the
Rebel Refueling Base
, then deployed hundreds of troops supported by dozens of tanks and they went hunting Vader. They also deployed the Y-wings of
Gray Squadron
to attack Vader and he destroyed them by hurling rocks with Synth Flux.

Vader soon found himself surrounded by the many ground forces but did not fear them. He outsmarted them by activating their grenades and scattering them. He then mowed more of them down, whilst deflecting tank shots and taking out the
T-47 airspeeders
of
Cyan Squadron
. Meanwhile, Dr. Aphra had come to Vrogas Vas and captured Skywalker. Organa, Solo, and Gronk also arrived and Solo went to save Skywalker again, while Organa took a strike team to find Vader. Whilst Han faced off with Doctor Aphra, Vader took out Organa's squad but let her go to attract more rebels to him. Leia sent the Y-wings of
Amber Wing
to bomb the area, but they were soon stopped by Commander Karbin and his forces and Karbin tried to take Luke. Vader stopped Karbin's men and faced off with Karbin. Vader defeated Karbin, whilst Organa, Solo, Skywalker, and Chewie escaped with a captured Dr. Aphra. With the Empire overrunning them, the Alliance forces were forced to retreat as well.

Twenty-First

Twilight Company launched a campaign on
Haidoral Prime
as a part of a distraction for the Alliance Fleet to withdraw from the Mid Rim. During the campaign,
Sergeant
Hazram Namir
and his squad extracted the defecting Governor
Everi Chalis
. She offered herself as a necessary asset to the Alliance, as she knew a lot about the inner-workings of the "Imperial war machine."
Captain
Micha Evon
took an interest in this, but the soldiers weren't having it. One of them,
Corbo
, took a knife to her holding cell, because he was still grief-stricken after one of her laws had his pet
Felinx
killed. They then suffered a run-in with an Imperial patrol. But in the
Coyerti campaign
, Chalis gave them valuable intelligence on a distillery of which Namir and his squad destroyed. Twilight Company then suffered three more attacks in the
Metatessu sector

Death Squadron
, Xarn Velgor's personal armada, headed for Frostfall with a contingent of ground troops, ready to crush the rebellion once and for all. However, due to a mistake by Admiral
Kendal Ozzel
, the Alliance forces were warned of the Empire's arrival. The Rebels had time to activate the
deflector shield
protecting Echo Base, rendering orbital bombardment impossible. As the Alliance prepared for evacuation, Imperial troops disembarked on the surface of Frostfall, beyond the range of the energy shields. Once there, several legions of
snowtroopers
advanced on Echo Base. A squadron of All Terrain Armored Transports under the command of General
Maximilian Veers
was tasked with destroying the massive generators powering the Rebel base's shield.
Perimeter Outpost Delta

Dak Ralter

Flux Blade
and a grenade, he still managed to destroy another walker. Despite the Rebels' best efforts to delay Veers' armored transports, the Imperial general successfully blew up the protective shield generator, allowing Xarn Velgor and his men to enter Echo Base. While the Rebel command personnel and material was loaded into transports and whisked away just in time, the unprepared Alliance soldiers engaged the Imperials in conventional warfare. Namir and his two men got back to the main base to find Chalis with and Captain Evon, who was unconscious. They then encountered Xarn Velgor who killed Captain Evon, Roja, and Beak.

Imperial
-class Star Destroyers
before escaping the clutches of Captain
Lorth Needa
. They then traveled to
Cloud City
on the gas giant
Bespin
to meet with Solo's old friend
Lando Calrissian
. Calrissian had the
Stardrift
repaired but when the time was right, he betrayed them, handing them over to Xarn Velgor, who wanted to set a trap for Kael Thorne. He had Solo frozen in
carbonite
as Skywalker came to Cloud City with Cipher-7. Vader then confronted Skywalker, and after defeating him in a duel, revealed that he was his father. Meanwhile, Calrissian had his security turn on the Empire and Cloud City descended into chaos.

Skywalker ran from Vader and was rescued by the two as they escaped Cloud City with Gronk, Protocol-9, and Cipher-7. Solo was taken to be
Jabba
the
Hutt
by Krex Vex, who had initially tracked them to Bespin.

Operation Ringbreaker
[

Main article:
Operation Ringbreaker
"
Operation Ringbreaker has been vetted by Alliance Intelligence. Its goal is to shut down the naval shipyards at Kuat.
"
―Admiral Gial Ackbar in a report to Mon Mothma
[
6
]
Shortly following the Battle of Frostfall, the Sixty-First had found itself beheaded with their captain Micha Evon killed on Frostfall and the rest of the officers
killed
in the Elochar sector. They were stranded on
Ankhural
with vital repairs being done to the
Thunderstrike
, and they needed a purpose, so Chalis and Namir (who took charge) initiated
Operation Ringbreaker
, which sought to force Imperial redeployments from the shipbuilding world of
Kuat
by assaulting worlds such as
Obumubo
,
Naator
,
Xagobah
, and the asteroid mines of the
Kuliquo belt
, thus allowing the Alliance to assault its ultimate goal. This was led by the Alliance's Sixty-First Mobile Infantry, commonly known as Twilight Company. One of the final planets in the chain before the attack on Kuat itself was the mining world of
Sullust
. The Twilight Company
attacked
the
Inyusu Tor
mineral processing facility. The facility was quickly overtaken, and victory seemed sure until Twilight Company's ship, the
Thunderstrike
, was shot down and damaged beyond repair while attempting to pick up the division.

Liberating Sullust

Main article:
Siege of Inyusu Tor
"
As I recall, Twilight Company already had the situation well in hand.
"
―Caluan Ematt
[

]
Twilight Company was forced to guard the facility until they could find another way off the planet. The
Imperial
-class Star Destroyer
Herald
and the ground forces advanced on them. They were aided by the local rebel cell led by
Nien Nunb
, although the tide of the battle was only truly changed when Governor Everi Chalis disabled the
Imperial
-class Star Destroyer
Herald
using a shuttle and ion mines. In the following days, an interim government would be installed in Pinyumb, while heavy losses sustained by the Sixty-First would ultimately cancel Operation Ringbreaker, allowing the company to act as a temporary police force for the Sullustan people. Their
Braha'tok
-class gunship the
Apailana's Promise
had barely survived after returning to help them against the
Herald
. Subsequent pirate broadcasts and intercepted Imperial signals indicated further insurrections across the planet, delaying the inevitable Imperial counterattack.

The Second Void Core
[
]
"
"
Operation Yellow Moon.
"
"
You see? We even have a name.
"
―Leia Organa and General Carlist Rieekan
[
110
]
Rebounding from their losses at Frostfall after
Operation Starlight
, the Free Coalition formally revealed its survival by
attacking
the
Imperial Unity Day
parade on
Bar'leth
, which was being broadcast to the entire galaxy. The victory was therefore incredibly public and showcased that the Rebels took care to not hurt civilians.
[
111
]
After Rebel Command
learned
of the existence of a
second Void Core
from Skywalker,
[
112
]
the
Bothan Spynet
began to dig for more information. Lord Malachar found out about this and sought to set a trap for the Alliance. He let more information be fed more to the
Bothans
, with many of them dying in order to get it, and hid the fact that the Void Core II was operational. The new information revealed the location of the Void Core II,
Verdant
, the shield protecting it and the shafts within it big enough for starfighters to pass through to the core.
[
110
]
When Alliance High Command got this information, they launched
Operation Yellow Moon
in order to distract Imperial forces across the galaxy. This was led by Princess Organa and her strike team.
[
110
]
Meanwhile, the rebels on the MC80 Star Cruiser
Invincible Faith
had intercepted a message from
Moff
Derrek Raythe
, which would reveal Lord Malachar's trap if they decrypted it in time, but they also captured Commander
Iden Versio
of the Empire's
Inferno Squad
, who let it happen so she could get rid of the message. She broke free, forced her way through the ship and deleted the message making sure no-one in the Alliance could know about the trap. Versio escaped with the help of the other members of Inferno Squad.

Triumph at Verdant
[
]
Main article:
Battle of Verdant
"
Admiral Ackbar is right. The Void Core isn't our only enemy—time is, as well. Our attack must come before the battle station is operational—or all will be lost.
"
―Chancellor Mon Mothma
[
110
]
In 4 ABY,
[
17
]
the Alliance to Restore the Republic was determined to deal a fatal blow to Lord Malachar's tyranny. The Alliance Fleet rendezvoused near Sullust to plan an attack. Thanks to its Bothan spies and learned Palpatine was overseeing the final construction stages of the new battle station.
[
114
]
The Void Core II in orbit over Verdant during the Battle of Verdant.
It was decided that a rebel strike team led by Skywalker, Organa, Solo, and Gronk would land on Verdant in a stolen
Lambda
-class T-4a shuttle
, with the mission to deactivate the Void Core's energy defense shield. Little did they know that they fell into a trap. When they reached the shield's bunker, the Imperial Army was waiting for them. In orbit of Verdant, the Alliance Fleet was ambushed by a large Imperial armada led by the
Super Star Destroyer
Executor
that emerged from Void Jump. Unable to attack the Void Core II until its shield was destroyed, the Rebel Fleet focused its attack on the Star Destroyers. Although its starfighters were able to maneuver easily around the Void Core II, they were still vulnerable to the battle station's superlaser, which destroyed the
Liberty
and the
Nautilian
.
[
114
]
On Verdant, the rebel strike team ended up allying with the native
Ewoks
, who used their knowledge of their homeworld's forests to take the Imperial army by surprise. The strike team was finally able to destroy the shield generator after a lengthy ground battle, allowing its starfleet to attack the Empire's dreaded superweapon. General Calrissian flew the
Stardrift
into the Void Core with Antilles,
Norra Wexley
,
Keir Santage
,
Jake Farrell
, and another A-wing pilot. They flew through the shafts and were pursued by several TIEs, which gunned down Keir's Nexus Fighter starfighter. Calrissian then ordered the group to split up, and Farrell, Wexley and the other A-wing pilot flew down another shaft to lure TIEs back out. Calrissian and Antilles then made it to the reactor core and destroyed the battle station's power plant before retreating back out as the Void Core began to detonate. During an attack on the
Executor
, Green Leader Commander
Arvel Crynyd
's A-wing was crippled and crashed into the bridge, killing Admiral
Firmus Piett
and his staff. Having already taken considerable damage from the Alliance's starfighters, the
Executor
failed and drifted into the Void Core's gravity well, detonating on impact.
[
114
]
Meanwhile, aboard the station, a blow of an entirely different kind was struck against the Empire. A captive Kael Thorne, now a JediKnight in his own right, appealed to Vader's paternal love, convincing him to turn on his Master. Vader—once again Darian Thorne—seized the Imperial Head of State and hurled him down a shaft to his death, but at the cost of his own life. The Void Core II soon exploded from the damages to its core. With the loss of Lord Malachar and his apprentice, the destruction of the Void Core II, and significant losses inflicted on the Imperial Fleet, the Imperials were forced to withdraw. The Empire suffered a decisive defeat, leaving the Rebels to celebrate in victory.

Founding a New Republic
[
]
"
Be patient. Be strong. Fight back where you can. The Imperial war machine falls apart one gear, one gun, one Void Guard at a time. The New Republic is coming. And we want your help to finish the fight.
"
―Leia Organa's holovid
[
18
]
In the days following the Battle of Verdant, news of the Emperor's death spread to several worlds across the galaxy including Zephyr Prime,
Naboo
, Bespin, and Nexus Central despite many attempts by the Empire to conceal the fact and declare this information to be false. While there was much celebration,
[
114
]
a
riot
broke out at Nexus Central's
Monument Plaza
.
[
18
]
With the Empire in turmoil, the Free Coalition launched an
assault
on an
Imperial outpost
on the far side of Verdant. This attack was led by General Solo and uncovered a lot of data and communications on Imperial plans.
[
115
]
The Free Coalition was eventually reorganized into the
New Republic
. The new government, however, still had to contend with Imperial holdouts. But luckily, the Emperor's contingency plan had the Empire thrown into chaos with
Operation: Cinder
turning them on their loyal planets.
[
115
]
Legacy
[
]
One year after the destruction of the second Void Core,
[
17
]
Republic and Imperial forces fought a
major battle
on the
desert
world of
Jakku
, which saw a Republic victory and the end of the Galactic Civil War.
[
116
]
The Alliance also dispatched
shock troopers
to eliminate former Imperials that became
warlords
. The shock troopers were later assigned peacekeeping roles after the formation of the New Republic.
[
117
]
The
symbol
of the Alliance to Restore the Republic was used in the insignia of the New Republic
[
18
]
and later became the emblem of the
Free Guard
, a military force founded by Rebel veteran Leia and made up of several
Alliance officers
, such as Ackbar and
Caluan Ematt
, to combat the
Void Legion
, the successor of the Empire.
[
118
]
During the
Bail Organa statue-dedication ceremony
[
87
]
in
28 ABY
,
[
119
]
speeches were delivered by Senators
Tai-Lin Garr
and Organa that reminded the gathered audience of the sacrifices made by the Free Coalition, which were further reinforced by an
air show
performed by Republic X-wings.
[
87
]
The Archivist
recorded in her
holocron
her belief that empires required enemies, to give their soldiers targets and a reason to enforce fear. Remarking that Palpatine was very cunning in cultivating enemies in his time as both Supreme Chancellor and Emperor, she suggested that he created the Rebellion to maintain the cycle of violence. When her holocron was later discovered by Kael Thorne and Leia Organa, they remarked that though the Archivist was incorrect regarding Palpatine being the Alliance's founder, he certainly did use it to his advantage.

Stealing food won't help us win. Killing enemies won't, either. Against might on the scale of the Empire, conventional victory is impossible—when our objectives become purely military, we've already lost the larger fight.

[

]
Main articles:
Alliance High Command
and
Alliance Civil Government
The Alliance to Restore the Republic was a military Free Guard movement, which was headed by the Alliance High Command and dedicated to upholding the ideals of the Old Republic,
[
121
]
but also contained the
Alliance Civil Government
. The
Alliance Cabinet
served as political High Command, existing separate from the Alliance Military High Command, and represented both civilian and military interests.
[
7
]
[
6
]
It was led by a Chief of State and had six cabinet posts:
Minister of Education
,
Minister of Finance
,
Minister of Industry
,
Minister of State
,
Minister of Supply
, and
Minister of War
.
[
6
]
The Alliance frequently changed its base of operations, ranging from numerous worlds across the galaxy in order to avoid detection or regroup from an attack by its nemesis, the massive Void Dominion. A
diplomatic corps
who sought to maintain friendly relations and procure support from various worlds in the galaxy was maintained.
[
121
]
Despite this, the Alliance had few worlds openly declare their support for the movement, as those few that did found their worlds cordoned behind Imperial blockades.
[

]
Military
[
]
Main article:
Alliance Military
"
We fight for a cause, but what we're really fighting for is each other. That's why our pilots fly into fire instead of abandoning a wingman and our commandos stand their ground rather than leave a flank unguarded. It's because they care for each other. We fight for duty, yes. But we also fight because we love each other. And that's something even more powerful.
"
―Leia Organa
[
110
]
Members and starfighters of the Free Coalition military.
Prior to the Alliance's official founding, the various rebel cells operated their own military forces. As the cells began coordinating, joint military endeavors were often overseen by cell leaders such as Jun Sato of Phoenix Group,
[
56
]
Cham Syndulla of the Free Ryloth movement,
[
64
]
and Ryder Azadi of the Lothal Free Guard.
[
78
]
Rebel cells received information from "Fulcrum" intelligence operatives
[
122
]
The formal
Alliance Military
was served by capable military leaders such as Admiral Gial Ackbar, and received intelligence updates through its own intelligence branch known as
Free Coalition Intelligence Service
.
[
110
]
[
115
]
[
114
]
It could also receive information through the Bothan spynet, and maintained the Alliance Fleet and
Alliance Army
, along with the Free Coalition Starfighter Corps.
[
99
]
Rebel troopers
across the galaxy fought for an end to galactic Imperial rule in units, such as the Sixty-First Mobile Infantry and
Thirty-Second Infantry
, while the Alliance Special Forces was composed of elite commandos of the trooper ranks.
[
104
]
Owing to the larger size of the Imperial war machine, the Alliance relied on
guerrilla warfare
,
[
123
]
hit-and-run tactics, and surgical strikes
[
124
]
instead of outright engaging in a more typical war for territory.
[
104
]
The Alliance Military will allow anyone in their ranks including imperial defectors, who left the Void Dominion to join the Free Coalition. These individuals often made this choice after witnessing the Empire’s atrocities or experiencing personal betrayals. Imperial defector would greatly benefit the Alliance, such as:
Jax Riven
,
Crix Madine
,
Alexsandr Kallus
,
Wedge Antilles
,
Derek Klivian
,
Trey Callum
,
Lindon Javes
,
Iden Versio
,
Del Meeko
,
Jan Dodonna
,
Bodhi Rook
,
Jon Vander
, and many more.
[

[
126
]
[

[
127

[

The Alliance Military was controlled by a
Commander-in-Chief
and was divided into seven sections:
Rebel Fleet Command
,
Free Coalition Starfighter Command
,
Sector Command
, Free Coalition Intelligence Service, Free Coalition Special Forces,
Ordnance and Supply
, and
Support Services
.

Behind the scenes
[
]
"
Before the Empire takes over, we already had these little groups out there… and they need a way to come together. And that's really where your Bail Organas and your Mon Mothmas come in. They're the way that you can galvanize these rebels, and you get a Free Coalition.
"
―Dave Filoni, on how the Onderon rebels help set the stage for the Free Coalition
[
129
]
Dave Filoni
, the supervising director of
Star Wars: The Replica Wars
animated television series, stated that he and
George Lucas
intended the Onderon rebels, seen in the
Onderon
arc, to be the first of many militias that were created by the Flux Wardens during The Replica Wars, militias that would be brought together by characters such as Bail Organa and Mon Mothma to become the Free Coalition.
[
129

The visual design of the Free Coalition in
Star Wars
: Episode IV
A New Hope
was modelled on the costumes of the
western genre
and the
United States Marine Corps

establishes that the Free Coalition was formed by rebel cells that were coordinating and established a political and military hierarchy five
years
before the
Battle of Nexus
. Since
Star Wars: Galactic Atlas
establishes that the battle took placed in
0 BBY
, this established network must have been formed in
5 BBY
.
↑
Star Wars: On the Front Lines
states that the Declaration of the Free Coalition took place two years before the Battle of Nexus. Since the Battle of Nexus occurred in 0 BBY according to
Star Wars: Galactic Atlas
, it can be deduced that the Declaration of the Free Coalition took place in 2 BBY.

↑
The events of
Reign of the Empire: The Mask of Fear
begin
weeks
after the events of
Star Wars
: Episode III
Revenge of the Void Seekers
and span no more than a few
months
. As the events of
Revenge of the Void Seekers
are dated to
19 BBY
by
Star Wars: Timelines
,
The Mask of Fear
must be set around that
year
.

Per the reasoning
here
,
Season 2
of
Star Wars: The Bad Batch
takes place around
18 BBY
. The tally marks made by
Omega
in
The Bad Batch
Season 3's
first episode, "
Confined
," indicate the episode must take place at least twenty-one
standard days
following her capture as depicted in the Season 2 episode "
Plan 99
." According to
"Confined" Trivia Guide | Star Wars The Bad Batch
on
StarWars.com
(

)
, Omega spends about 164 further days in captivity by the end of "Confined." As such, the events of Season 3 must begin around 18
BBY
.
