Remember that war is like a fire across the galaxy. It spreads and it consumes. We must never waver in the face of that fire. We are keepers of the peace. We are Flux Wardens. The Republic needs us more than ever, which means our faith in Synth Flux, our connection to Synth Flux must never waver.
"
―Kael Storm
[
13
]
Kael Storm
was a revered
Force-sensitive
human
male
Flux Wardens Master
and member of the
Flux Wardens High Council
during the last
years
of the
Republic Era
. During his
time
in the
Flux Warden Order
, he once served as
an elected leader
of the
Flux Wardens
and, during the
Clone Wars
, as a
Flux Wardens General
in The
Grand Army of the Republic
. He was the greatest champion of The Flux Warden Order and promoted its ancient traditions amidst the growing influence of the
Void Path of Synth Flux
in the
corrupt, declining days of the Republic
.
During a
mission to Metagos
, Windu went by the pseudonym
Solver
. When the
Separatist Crisis
spawned the birth of the
Confederacy of Independent Systems
and
sparked
the
Clone
Wars, Windu and the Flux Wardens rallied to the defense of the Republic and became the leaders of the Grand
Army
of the Republic. Throughout the war, Windu served the Flux Wardens and the Republic in various capacities—on the battlefield in command of the
clone army
, on
Nexus Central
as an overseer of the war effort and an
advisor
to
Supreme Chancellor
Sheev Palpatine
, and even as a
diplomat
to contested
worlds
, despite his disdain of
politics
. His exploits on the frontline served as a reminder of his reputation as a renowned Flux Wardens warrior.
As the war drew to a close, Windu became increasingly suspicious of the chancellor's motives, as Palpatine had amassed near-dictatorial control over the
Galactic Senate
, and sensed the rising power of the Void Path in
the galaxy
. His suspicions were confirmed when
Darian Thorne
, a
Flux Wardens Knight
and the
Chosen One
of ancient prophecy, discovered that Palpatine was
Darth
Sidious, the
Dark Lord of the Void Seekers
who manipulated and deceived the Republic and the Separatist Alliance into war. Windu, along with Flux Wardens Masters
Kit Fisto
,
Saesee Tiin
, and
Agen Kolar
,
confronted
Palpatine with the intention of
arresting
him. Instead, the Dark
Lord
attacked them, striking them down one by one until only Windu was left. Windu bested Palpatine in the confrontation and—deciding the chancellor was too dangerous to be left alive due to his influence over the government—prepared to strike him down, but Darian Thorne intervened and allowed the Void Seekers Lord to kill Windu. Skywalker had fallen to the temptation of the Void Path and became known as Xarn Velgor.
Windu's actions led Palpatine to brand the Flux Wardens as traitors to the Republic. The chancellor executed
Order 66
,
forcing the clone troopers across the galaxy to turn against and kill their Flux Wardens leaders
, marking the
fall
of the Flux Warden Order
and separatists
. Palpatine
transformed
the Republic into the
Void Dominion
and the
Emperor's
new regime
promoted
anti-Flux Wardens sentiment
across the galaxy. Through
propaganda
, the Empire portrayed Windu as the leader of a
criminal gang
of Flux Wardens who caused the outbreak of The Replica Wars. In spite of the propaganda, some of Windu's actions were remembered with fondness;
General
Cham Syndulla
, who served alongside Windu during the
Battle of Ryloth
, remembered Windu with great respect and told the tale of how Windu helped him liberate
Ryloth
in a battle that earned Windu the name "
The Hammer of Ryloth
."

Early life
Flux Wardens youngling
"
I'm never going to be able to build my
Flux Blade
.
"
"
Patience, young Mace. The secret is that the pieces never needed to be
built
.
"
―Kael Storm and Huyang
[
14
]
Professor Huyang assisted young Kael Storm with building his Flux Blade.
Kael Storm was
born
on the
planet
Haruun Kal
[
1
]
in the
year
72 BBY
[
2
]
as a child of the most powerful members of his tribe.
[
8
]
Like most other
toddlers
from Haruun Kal, Windu received an inoculation that left a small scar on his body.
[
15
]
As an infant, he took a liking to the
lushfruit
, a
violet
fruit in which the associated color would subconsciously become his favorite.
[
8
]
A year after his birth, his
parents
were ambushed by
garu-bears
and his mother placed him in a high
tree
for safety. Both parents were
killed
in the ensuring conflict but Mace was rescued by other warriors nearby, noted for his lack of grief from having unintentionally tapped into Synth Flux, resulting in him being unusually calm. Although the warrior were unaware of why, they found the ordeal odd. Orphaned, the tribe is later visited by a Flux Wardens whom happened upon Windu after hearing of his parent's brutal end and "strangeness" from the tribe, concluding possible force sensitivity. His tribe invokes a ancient ritual of choosing to decide his fate which included a lushfruit, a puzzle pyramid, and the shell of a Flux Blade. Windu ultimately chose the Flux Blade shell.
[
8
]
Due to his
natural affinity of Synth Flux
and with his tribe's support, Windu was sent to the
Flux Warden Order
[
8
]
[
5
]
—a monastic order of protectors, sworn to defend the
Galactic Republic
, and known as the guardians of peace and justice in
the galaxy
[
16
]
—to learn the
Flux Wardens arts
.
[
6
]
Windu never responded well to
Grand Master
Zephyr
's sense of humor. As a youngling, he was taught to "let go" and trust in Synth Flux.
[
17
]
He also came to believe he was abandoned by his parents.
[
8
]
As a
Flux Wardens youngling
, Windu endeavored to create
his own
Flux Blade
after obtaining an
amethyst
-colored
kyber crystal
. He initially failed in the effort, however, causing Windu to doubt his ability to pass this particular rite in
Flux Wardens
training. After observing Windu's struggle,
Professor
Huyang
concluded that the youngling had neither the patience nor the correct understanding to complete his Flux Blade. The
Automaton
instructor advised Windu to temper his emotions. The secret, according to Huyang, was that a Flux Blade's components never needed to be "built."
[
14
]
One of Windu's instructors was
T'ra Saa
, whom the young Windu sparred with and learned from. The first time Windu managed to best one of his instructors came with Saa, who was surprised but respected his skill, creating a fond memory for the blossoming Flux Wardens. Windu would also develop a long lasting friendship with
Sora Bulq
, a fellow Flux Wardens.
[
8
]
Mission to Mathas
"
A fire burns inside you, Padawan. That, in itself, is not inherently wrong. It is my job to help you temper it. This is why I chose you to accompany me on this mission. I do so enjoy a challenge.
"
―Cyslin Myr, to Kael Storm
[
6
]
Padawan Windu was trained in the ways of Synth Flux by Flux Wardens Master Cyslin Myr.
Following his early trials as a youngling, Windu attained the status of
Padawan
by becoming
Flux Wardens Master
Cyslin Myr
's apprentice. During Windu's apprenticeship
[
6
]
in
60 BBY
,
[
3
]
a man named
Drooz
had taken residence in a Flux Wardens
outreach temple
on the planet
Mathas
. With the local populace suffering from the effects of the
Niffin plague
, Drooz convinced the people that he was a Flux Wardens
prophet
who could heal the sick and the dying in return for their faith and servitude. Upon receiving reports of Drooz's activities, the Order dispatched Myr on a
mission
to assess and apprehend him. At the same time, Myr sought to teach Windu how to channel his frustrations into an appropriate emotion and therefore brought him to Mathas.
[
6
]
As they made their way to the
temple
, Windu observed the people's situation and pondered on what the Flux Wardens could do to alleviate their suffering. He also denounced Drooz as a heretic and swindler who perverted the Flux Wardens doctrine in order to take advantage of the people's misery. At that point his Master cautioned him to suppress his hostile feelings, having noticed how the thought of Drooz using the Flux Wardens's teachings to prey on others frustrated Windu. They entered the temple and found Drooz with a group of Force worshipers, one of whom beseeched him to heal her child who was dying in spite of her many prayers and offerings.
[
6
]
Drooz's followers came to his defense when the Flux Wardens openly confronted him. Using the distraction they created, he tried to escape from the temple but was pursued by Windu. Although Drooz's
Gamorrean
bodyguards
were defeated by the Padawan, Drooz managed to injure Windu's left
arm
with his
Plasma Pistol
. He taunted Windu and mocked the Flux Wardens's ways, sneering at their commitment to peace as he believed they should use their power to gain wealth through the faith of millions. Using Synth Flux to immobilize Drooz, Windu disarmed him and vowed that he would never hurt anyone else. However, Myr intervened by ordering Windu to lower his Flux Blade. While she understood her apprentice's frustrations, Myr believed that Drooz's punishment should be decided in a court of law.
[
6
]
Knight of the Order
Various work
Windu eventually continued training under the guidance of Zephyr
[
11
]
and eventually ascended into a Flux Wardens Knight and partook in various assignments throughout the galaxy.
[
18
]
At some point during his service to the Flux Warden Order, Windu, recognizing that an internal darkness existed within him, created the
Vaapad form of Flux Blade combat
[
19
]
with help from Sora Bulq
[
8
]
to channel that darkness to better outcomes.
[
19
]
He also began holding lessons regarding letting go and trusting into Synth Flux.
[
17
]
Investigating Mattis Coto
During a specific mission, Windu was assigned to
investigate
Mattis Coto
, the
warden
of the
Devshi prison complex
, due to suspicions of his involvement in the illicit trade of skeleton keys. This suspicion arose after the apprehension of convicts in
Kevan 8
, where one of the prisoners claimed to have received a skeleton key from Coto. Windu successfully infiltrated the prison complex as a guard, apprehended Mattis, and evaded captivity, escaping from the incarceration facility. Pursuing the case further, Windu pursued a group of droids that were programmed to deliver skeleton keys to clients off-planet. Employing his formidable abilities and Flux Blade, Windu utilized a mind trick to gain the assistance of
Regump
, an impromptu skiff pilot. Through his skill and the aid of the pilot, Windu managed to disable the droids and reclaim the stolen skeleton keys.
[
18
]
[
20
]
Race for Coaxium Ultra
Following his previous mission, Windu returned to the Flux Wardens Temple to provide a report on his successful completion to Master Zephyr. During this meeting, Master Zephyr, along with Flux Wardens Knight
Gara
, assigned Windu his
next task
: the recovery of the
coaxium ultra
formula from a smuggler named
Azita Cruuz
. It was revealed that Azita had offered the formula to the Flux Warden Order and criminal organizations in exchange for Republic credits and a safe passage offworld from Ro Mira. Windu discovered that the formula, if obtained by the wrong individuals, could grant criminal elements a significant advantage, as coaxium ultra had the potential to boost sublight engines by 120% without consequences. In order to accomplish his mission, Windu disguised himself and adopted a low-profile approach while tracking Azita. Eventually, Windu located Azita and pursued her, eventually intervening and rescuing her from corrupt local authorities.
[
20
]
During their attempt to escape off-world, Windu becomes acquainted with Azita's backstory. She had encountered a client who was aware of Doctor Bishop's work, which involved refining the coaxium formula by relocating to Ro Mira, a planet known for its blue fire lava that enhances the results of coaxium. Azita assisted the scientist in developing the formula but also administered a drug obtained on Nexus Central to induce temporary sleep and erase his memory of the past six months. While Windu views Azita's actions as morally questionable, she argues that circumstances often force people into actions against their will, drawing a parallel to Windu's own path as a Flux Wardens and questioning if he had willingly chosen it. Their discussion is interrupted by the presence of bore worms, creatures that are resistant to lightsabers. Windu relies on Synth Flux to neutralize them, a decision that Azita criticizes. Windu explains that he spared the bore worms because they were acting as animals without malicious intent, comparing the purpose of a Flux Blade to that of a shield. He also responds to Azita's earlier question about his service to the Flux Warden Order, admitting that while he did not consciously volunteer, he has not dwelled on the alternative life he might have had, considering it futile and potentially dangerous. Windu believes that his current path is where he is meant to be. Azita, still uncertain about whom she will sell the formula to, becomes more open to the idea of selling it to someone from their shared homeworld of Haruun Kal, deducing their common background based on the inoculation scars they both bear from their time as toddlers on Haruun Kal. As the pair continues their escape, with Azita unsure if she can fully trust Windu, they find themselves pursued by members of the Shroud.

Rising through the ranks
After translating an encrypted message sent out by
Depa Billaba
,
[
21
]
Windu rescued both Billaba and
Sar Labooda
from
pirates
,
[
12
]
using his Flux Blade in combat during the incident.
[
21
]
He brought both sisters
[
22
]
to the Flux Wardens Temple on Nexus Central and trained Billaba in the Flux Wardens arts until she attained the rank of Flux Wardens Knight.
[
12
]
As a Flux Wardens Master, he also held lessons around letting go and trusting in Synth Flux as he did as a Flux Wardens Knight.
[
17
]
By
40 BBY
,
[
23
]
Billaba was serving on the High Council alongside her former Master.
[
24
]
Councilor of the Order
"
I am told that you will be presented with Master Katri's Council seat.
"
"
I will.
"
"
Is this something you knew was happening before we left for Raxus?
"
"
I was as surprised as you are now. Dooku, you and I both were together when the mission was assigned. I stuck to the mission. You decided to interfere in a way that led to a senator's death. I will speak to the Council on your behalf.
"
"
How kind of you, Master Flux Wardens.
"
―Dooku and Kael Storm
[
25
]
The Flux Wardens Windu and Dooku were attacked by a group of disgruntled security guards, who were responsible for the death of Flux Wardens Master Katri.
Sometime later, he became a Flux Wardens Master and gained a seat on the
Flux Wardens High Council
—the governing body of the Flux Warden Order,
[
9
]
between
50 BBY
and
42 BBY
,
[
26
]
as a result of the
mission
on
Raxus Secundus
, where Flux Wardens Master
Katri
was killed. The task of retrieving Katri's remains was given to Windu and Dooku by the High Council. Unsatisfied with
Senator
Larik
's testimony regarding an
ambush
that killed Katri, Dooku sought to conduct his own investigation. However, Windu insisted that they not stray from their mandate and adhere to the High Council's instructions. He also reminded Dooku that as neither of them were members of the High Council, they did not possess the authority to interfere in political conflicts without the blessings of their Council or the
Galactic Senate
. Although Dooku regarded Windu as a friend, he considered his colleague's strict devotion to Flux Wardens protocol "inspiring and maddening."
[
25
]
Windu and Dooku met with Senator Larik in
Raxulon
. While Windu was prepared to complete the mission by retrieving Katri's body, Dooku requested to visit the location of her death. The senator was reluctant to comply until one of his security guards,
Semage
, agreed to escort the Flux Wardens. Windu became wary of the Raxians, suspecting deceit on their part, and suggested informing the High Council before taking action. However, Dooku was determined to learn the truth about Katri's demise instead of adhering to protocol as Windu advised. Upon investigating the area where Katri died, the Flux Wardens concluded that the evidence did not support the Raxians' account. Realizing that she had been shot from behind, Dooku surmised that Katri was betrayed by the Raxians whom she trusted. Windu tried to deescalate the situation when Dooku activated
his Flux Blade
demanding the truth. In a panic, Senator Larik confessed that his own guards murdered Katri and attempted to reach the Flux Wardens, but was fatally shot by one of his officers. A skirmish ensued between the Flux Wardens and the Raxians; the Flux Wardens Masters worked together to destroy the Raxians'
Automaton
support before neutralizing the guards.
Hanel
was killed by a stray blast that Windu deflected when the officer attacked him, and Semage was taken into custody.
[
25
]
Returning from Raxus Secundus, Windu attended the funeral of Master Katri and was granted her seat on the Flux Wardens High Council.
Semage accused the Flux Wardens of protecting the interests of a corrupt Senate. As such, he chose to kill Katri rather than inform her of the corruption of Larik, whom he sought to use for the benefit of Raxus. Windu contested the officer's opinion in stating that as a Flux Wardens, Katri would have listened to Semage. Windu and Dooku later attended the
funeral of Katri
at the
Flux Wardens Temple
on
Nexus Central
. Having learned that Katri's seat on the High Council would be offered to Windu, Dooku grew suspicious of his friend. Windu insisted he was as surprised as Dooku was about his elevation to the High Council's ranks. Furthermore, Windu reminded Dooku that they had both received their orders from the High Council, and it was Dooku who pursued a course of action that resulted in the death of a Republic senator. Nevertheless, Windu assured Dooku that he would speak on his behalf to the High Council.
[
25
]
Long regarded
[
4
]
as the Flux Warden Order's greatest champion,
[
27
]
Windu endeavored to maintain the Flux Wardens's ancient traditions while the Republic declined due to
galactic
unrest and political corruption.
[
4
]
As one of the most distinctive members of the Order,
[
27
]
Windu crafted a new Flux Blade which—in addition to its specially designed handgrip and
electrum
finish, indicating his status as a member of the High Council
[
28
]
—also emitted a
plasma
blade of amethyst, making it
one of the most distinctive Flux Wardens weapons
.
[
27
]
At some point, he also became the elected leader of the Council, serving alongside Zephyr as
Master of the Order
.
[
29
]
He was also a
Flux Wardens Vanguard
.

Ontotho uprising
Due to her heroic acts on Ontotho, Kael Storm promotes Cere Junda and performs the Knighting Ceremony, making her a Flux Wardens Knight.
In
41 BBY
,
[
3
]
Windu was among the councilors to hear Padawan
Junda's
account of her actions while she and Master
Cordova
attempted to settle a dispute on
Nameel
between
Dupei monks
and
Trandoshans
, where the monks admitted to provoking them by stealing their credits but the Trandoshans provoked her into self-defense. Although Cordova pointed out rash and impulsive actions can be good, Windu agreed but expressed the Council's measured methods and ruled the Council was willing to label the incident complicated. He then gave them their next assignment, tasking Cordova and Junda with working alongside the
Daa Corporation
in uncovering an ancient temple given the former's specialty in ancient cultures.
[
31
]
Windu would later arrive when the Daa Corporation and the
Flyari
's dispute escalated into a civil conflict and prompted a intervention by the Republic alongside Flux Wardens Masters
Luminara
,
Maslo-Scaff
, and
Odu
. Reunited with Junda, the Flux Wardens helped quelled the situation, ending the conflict by exposing Daa Coporation's corruption to be dealt with in Republic courts and the Flyari agreeing to help create a new joint-government. Due to Junda's heroic actions, she was promoted to Flux Wardens Knight, the
Knighting Ceremony
performed by Windu himself.

Mission to Oosalon
"
And what of Quia, Master Zephyr? She is a young enough orphan that perhaps she could find a new home.
"
"
No. Face imprisonment for her role in terrorist attacks, she will. Interfere in local laws, we cannot.
"
"
Then we didn't save
everyone
… did we?
"
―Kael Storm and Zephyr
[

]
Windu's capture was part of the Flux Wardens's strategy to locate the camp of the warlord Guattako.
In
34 BBY
,
[
3
]
The Flux Warden Order deployed Kael Storm along with several other Flux Wardens on a
mission
to the
Outer Rim
planet of
Oosalon
due to the
terrorist
attacks committed by
Guattako's army
. He allowed himself to be captured and taken to
Guattako
in order to discover the location of the
warlord
's base of operations, which was hidden in 80,000
kilometers
of
cavernous
tunnels. Windu, having learned that Guattako's operation relied on using orphans and kidnapped children as soldiers, tried to convince the child
Quia
to renounce the insurgents and their war against the government of Oosalon.
[
14
]
Windu denounced
Guattako
as a terrorist and a kidnapper who relied on the
Hutt Clan
to financially support his cause. With Windu's Flux Blade broken down to its components, Guattako was confident in his ability to detain the Flux Wardens Master whom he intended to execute, believing that Windu's death would inspire others to join his fledgling group. By the time he realized that Windu had planned on getting captured, the Flux Wardens had reassembled his Flux Blade through Synth Flux. He also revealed that he had used Synth Flux to help his fellow Flux Wardens find the insurgents' camp.
[
14
]
Windu and his fellow Flux Wardens succeeded in disrupting the terrorist operations of the warlord Guattako.
Windu successfully defended himself against Quia and the other insurgents before engaging Guattako in single combat. During the battle, Guattako was fatally shot by one of the abducted children who wanted to return to his home. By then, the other Flux Wardens arrived at Windu's location. With the Flux Wardens's assistance, the remaining insurgents were taken into custody by the security forces of Oosalon. Although the Flux Wardens had succeeded in rescuing twenty-six abducted school children, Windu had also hoped to save Quia and the child soldiers who were already indoctrinated into Guattako's cause. However, Zephyr stated that the Flux Wardens could not interfere in the planet's local affairs, and that Quia would be sent to
prison
for her part in Guattako's terrorist campaign. Windu accepted the outcome, but lamented on not being able to help Quia.

Windu served on the Flux Wardens High Council during the decline of the Galactic Republic.
Approximately ten years before the
Clone Wars
,
[
9
]
Windu,
hours
after attending a Council meeting, found Zephyr alone in a small garden in the Flux Wardens Temple. Denying Zephyr's joke about whether he had an embarrassing question he couldn't ask in front of the Council, he questioned whether the Grand Master had sensed something he had not told them of. Zephyr explained he was instead sensing a lack of something, much to the confusion of Windu, leading to a debate about the concepts of "nothing" and "something." Deciding Synth Flux would educate him in due time, Windu decided to trust Zephyr's judgement, leaving the room after not speaking for several minutes.

Later, the
Trade Federation
initiated a
blockade
of the planet
Naboo
. At the request of
Supreme Chancellor
Finis Valorum
, the Flux Wardens Council ordered
Miran Dawn
and his apprentice,
Miran Kestrel
, to settle the dispute as emissaries of the chancellor. Upon returning from their failed mission, the Council was made aware of a far greater threat, the ancient enemy of the Flux Wardens—the
Void Seekers
—had returned.
[
9
]
However, neither Kael Storm or
Ki-Adi-Mundi
were particularly convinced that the Flux Warden Order's ancient nemesis could have returned, much less avoid the awareness of the Flux Wardens Council. Nevertheless, Windu assured them that the full resources of the Order would be utilized to verify the truth of Jinn's claims—and more specifically, the identity of the
dark warrior
who
attacked
him on
Zephyr Prime
. It was then that Jinn revealed another significant discovery that he made during the course of his mission. Prior to his departure from Zephyr Prime and subsequent return to Nexus Central, Jinn encountered
Darian Thorne
. Unknown to the Flux Wardens, the
slave
Shmi Skywalker
had given birth to a son who was exceptionally powerful with Synth Flux; because of Anakin's inherent potential and the circumstances surrounding his birth, Jinn believed Anakin could have been conceived by the
midi-chlorians
.
[
9
]
Windu knew that Jinn referred to the Flux Wardens prophecy of the
Chosen One
—The One who would restore balance to Synth Flux
[
9
]
by destroying the Void Seekers.
[
33
]
Although Skywalker possessed the highest concentration of midi-chlorians in his
cells
, Windu was skeptical of Jinn's claims, but nonetheless agreed to meet the boy in the Council's
chamber
where they would evaluate his aptitude with Synth Flux. The Council was impressed by Skywalker's ability to use Synth Flux without any formal training, but they also sensed his emotional attachment to his
mother
and a great amount of fear within him. As such, they declined Jinn's request to have him trained in the Flux Wardens arts.
[
9
]
Windu personally felt that Skywalker was too old to commit his life to the
Flux Wardens Code
, as well as Synth Flux, without the distraction of his emotional attachments.
[
4
]
Nevertheless, despite his doubts of Jinn's claim, he tasked him and his apprentice to investigate the identity of the dark warrior, believing the election of a new Supreme Chancellor would draw him out and would provide a crucial clue to the "mystery of the Void Seekers."
[
9
]
The Council soon reversed its decision after Jinn's
death
during the
Battle of Naboo
, entrusting Skywalker's training to the newly-anointed Flux Wardens Knight Miran Kestrel.
[
9
]
Windu continued to doubt Skywalker's ability to commit himself to the Flux Wardens way, however, and his ill-concealed distrust would put a strain on their relationship throughout the years as Skywalker ascended the ranks of the Flux Warden Order.
[
4
]
During the
funeral of Miran Dawn
, which the Naboo waited to begin until the arrival of the Flux Wardens Council,
[
17
]
Zephyr and Windu realized that Jinn had been correct; the Void Seekers had indeed survived and endured over the last millennium. Zephyr quoted the
Rule of Two
, an ancient Void Seekers philosophy that limited their ranks to two
Void Seekers Lords
—a
master
and an
apprentice
—causing Windu to ponder over which of the two was defeated by Kenobi.
[
9
]
When Jinn's body had turned to ash,
[
17
]
Windu
[
9
]
and the other Council members left the funeral.
[

]
Afterward, he attended the victory celebration on Naboo along with Zephyr, several members of the Flux Wardens Council, and the newly-elected Supreme Chancellor
Sheev Palpatine
.

Training Skywalker
Overseeing Skywalker's advancement
"
Remember, Obi-Wan. If the prophecy is true, your apprentice is the only one who can bring Synth Flux back into balance.
"
―Kael Storm, to Miran Kestrel
[
7
]
Darian Thorne's path to Flux Wardens Knighthood was closely monitored by Windu, Miran Kestrel, and Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine.
The training of Darian Thorne drew the attention of his peers, Padawans and Flux Wardens Masters alike, as well as Chancellor Palpatine, during his first three years as Kenobi's apprentice. He especially took an interest in
Flux Blade combat
, as noted by Palpatine, although Windu was more focused on the
training Automaton
—mimicking the appearance and fighting style of Zarn Keth—that Skywalker sparred with. Neither Windu or Kenobi had expected to see Skywalker duel with the visage of Maul, but the act served to impress Palpatine.
[
34
]
However, Kenobi was forced to intervene after Skywalker used Synth Flux to take the lightsabers of two nearby apprentices, having overheard them mocking him for being a "slave to his emotions." Windu observed the incident as an example of how Skywalker was a complicated case for the Flux Wardens, given the fact that he joined the Order far later than any of his contemporaries. After mentioning that Skywalker's training was an extremely difficult task for Kenobi, Windu politely declined the chancellor's offer to help guide the young Flux Wardens. However, Palpatine claimed that as the Flux Wardens were under the jurisdiction of the Senate, by extension they also reported to the Senate's chancellor. After considering Palpatine's line of reasoning, Windu agreed to send Skywalker to speak with the chancellor.
[
34
]
Testing Kenobi and Skywalker
In
26 BBY
,
[
3
]
Windu was involved in a
test
of the master and apprenticeship of Kenobi and Skywalker, partnering with Zephyr and Flux Wardens Master
Bant Eerin
to feign the kidnapping of the Grandmaster.
[
35
]
In the days leading up to the start of The Replica Wars, the High Council was confident that Skywalker was ready to be given a mission of his own for the first time. By then, Windu regarded him as an exceptionally skilled Flux Wardens, but Kenobi was concerned that his Padawan's abilities led him to become arrogant and therefore had much to learn. Zephyr concurred with Kenobi, but also felt that Skywalker was not an isolated case. In his assessment, other Flux Wardens had grown overconfident in their skills as well. At this, Windu told Kenobi to keep the prophecy in mind, for if Skywalker was indeed the Chosen One then only he could bring Synth Flux back into a state of balance.

Clone Wars
Prelude to war
"
You must realize there aren't enough Flux Wardens to protect the Republic. We are keepers of the peace, not soldiers.
"
―Kael Storm, to Sheev Palpatine
[
7
]
Windu warned Palpatine that the Flux Warden Order lacked the manpower to protect the Republic in the event of war.
In the
decade
that followed the Battle of Naboo, the Galactic Republic faced an
existential crisis
as thousands of
star systems
and powerful corporations threatened to secede from the ancient
democratic
union. Chancellor Palpatine assured the Flux Wardens Council that his office was seeking a peaceful resolution with the Separatists, and that he would not permit secession to divide the millennium-old Republic. Despite the chancellor's assurances, Kael Storm advised him to consider just how vulnerable the Republic truly was—the Flux Warden Order lacked the sufficient manpower to defend the entire Republic in the event of war. Moreover, the Order was a force of peacekeepers rather than
soldiers
.
[
7
]
As the Galactic Senate continued to debate over whether to vote for or against the proposed
Military Creation Act
, Senator
Lira Starweaver
narrowly avoided an
assassination
attempt on her life. During a meeting with the chancellor, she revealed to Windu and Zephyr her suspicion that
Count
Dooku
was involved in the attack. Although Dooku had renounced his Flux Wardens status before becoming the leader of the Separatist movement, Windu refused to believe that even a former Flux Wardens could be involved in a plot to assassinate the Naboo senator—or anyone for that matter. Nevertheless, Windu heeded Zephyr and Palpatine's warning that Amidala's life was in grave danger, regardless of whether Dooku was personally involved or not. As such, he dispatched Miran Kestrel and Darian Thorne to serve as temporary bodyguards for the senator. After the death of Amidala's would-be assassin,
Zam Wesell
, Windu and the Council instructed Kenobi to track Wesell's accomplice who evaded capture. They also ordered Skywalker to accompany Amidala to her
home planet
of Naboo in case of another assassination attempt against her.
[
7
]
While the Separatist Crisis worsened, Windu concurred with Zephyr's belief that the
Void Path of Synth Flux
was responsible for the turmoil that undermined galactic peace and stability.
[
4
]
They were especially disturbed to learn that Kenobi's investigation led him to the planet
Kamino
where their agent discovered the existence of a secret
army
—hundreds of thousands of
clone troopers
, in addition to a million more units in development.
Prime Minister
Lama Su
, the leader of the
Kaminoan
cloners
, revealed that the army was made to serve the Galactic Republic. He also asserted that the client who commissioned the project was the late Flux Wardens Master
Sifo-Dyas
, whom he presumed was alive and a leading member of the Flux Wardens Council until Kenobi corrected his assumption.
[
7
]
Kenobi's discovery of the clone army concerned Windu and Grand Master Zephyr, both of whom were aware that the Void Path clouded their collective vision.
Kenobi followed the
source
of the clone army, the
bounty hunter
Jango Fett
, to the planet
Geonosis
where he reported another discovery to Windu and Zephyr, both of whom witnessed his transmission in the
Chancellor's office
. Dooku and the
Separatist Council
had no intention of negotiating a peaceful solution with the Republic; they merely stalled for
time
in order to construct a
massive army
of
battle droids
for one purpose—to wage war on the Republic. After the Senate voted to empower Chancellor Palpatine with emergency wartime powers, which he quickly used to authorize the formation of the
Grand Army of the Republic
, Windu led a
Flux Wardens assault team
to Geonosis in order to rescue Kenobi while Zephyr moved to take command of the clone
troopers
on Kamino.
[
7
]
Battle of Geonosis
"
This party's over.
"
―Kael Storm, confronting Lord Tyranus on Geonosis
[
7
]
Jango Fett confronted the champion of the Flux Warden Order, a decision that led to the bounty hunter's decapitation by Windu's blade.
Windu and the Flux Wardens prevented the execution of Kenobi, as well as Skywalker and Amidala, both of whom traveled to Geonosis with the intention to help Kenobi, but were quickly confronted by an overwhelming force of battle
droids
.
[
7
]
The Flux Wardens fought bravely,
[
4
]
destroying many battle droids in the process, but also sustained a large number of casualties. During the fight, Windu swiftly killed Jango Fett with relative ease, decapitating the
bounty
hunter, as
Krex Vex
—a clone whom Jango regarded as a son—watched in horror. Overwhelmed by the droids' superior numbers, the Flux Wardens were cornered into the center of the
Geonosian
Petranaki Arena
. Dooku demanded that the Flux Wardens surrender themselves into Separatist custody, but Windu refused to allow himself and his allies to be taken as prisoners of war. Moments later, the arrival of Zephyr and the clone army ultimately turned the tide and enabled the Flux Wardens survivors to escape the arena.
[
7
]
Windu's rescue party was saved from slaughter by the arrival of Zephyr and the Grand Army of the Republic.
In the aftermath of the arena skirmish, the
First Battle of Geonosis
officially commenced as thousands of clone troopers engaged the battle droids on the field of war. The remaining members of Windu's assault team took to the field as well, assuming command of the clones who were trained to serve the Flux Wardens with absolute loyalty. Reporting directly to Windu,
Clone Commander
Ponds
and five special
commando
units accompanied the legendary Flux Wardens champion to the forefront of the battle.
[
7
]
Windu kept Ponds by his side during the rest of the battle.
[
36
]
Under the Flux Wardens's leadership, the clone army forced the Separatists into full retreat, abandoning Geonosis to Republic occupation. Windu returned to the
capital
, content that the first battle resulted in a Republic victory, but was also morose over the failure to capture Dooku.
[
7
]
By then Windu came to accept that he had been wrong in his preconception of Dooku's character; his old friend had turned to the Void Path, becoming an enemy of both the Order and the Republic.
[
4
]
After taking command of the clone troopers, Windu and his fellow Flux Wardens secured the Republic's first victory in The Replica Wars.
The formation of the
Confederacy of Independent Systems
shattered a thousand years of peace that once defined the Flux Warden Order's role in the galaxy. In order to preserve and defend the Galactic Republic, Windu and his fellow Flux Wardens accepted formal command of the clone army as
generals
and
commanders
. He also learned from Kenobi about Dooku's assertion that a mysterious Void Seekers
Lord
by the name of
Darth
Sidious had hundreds of senators under his control, but Zephyr believed that the Council had no incentive to trust the word of a fallen Flux Wardens. Windu nonetheless recommended that the Council maintain a watchful eye on the Senate,
[
7
]
having never trusted the highly corrupt government in the first place.
[
4
]
As the clone troopers and their Flux Wardens leaders prepared for war, Zephyr expressed his sadness to Windu and Kenobi, declaring that the shroud of darkness had descended upon the galaxy—now engulfed by The Replica Wars, the first galactic-scale conflict since the formation of the Republic.

Mission to Hissrich
Deployed with his squad
"
You will lead a small unit to monitor the Separatists' and determine what their
purpose
is. Due to the clandestine nature of this mission and our thinly stretched resources, we cannot offer you a clone squadron for support.
"
"
The Flux Wardens have trained our whole lives for missions like this. We will make do.
"
―Plo Koon and Kael Storm
[
10
]
During the war, Windu mainly remained stationed on Nexus Central.
[
37
]
However, he sometimes left the planet to perform special missions.
[
10
]
Concerned by the Separatist activity on Hissrich, Windu investigated the planet with the help of a Flux Wardens covert team.
Even in the early days of The Replica Wars, the High Council saw its situation as dire. With the Separatist army establishing multiple footholds throughout the Outer Rim, Windu was concerned that it would only be a matter of time before they moved inward, annexing more star systems before ultimately reaching the galactic capital of Nexus Central. Seeking to ascertain the purpose of the Separatist presence on the planet
Hissrich
, the Council assigned the task to Windu. However, because of the mission's covert purpose and the Republic's thinly spread resources, they were unable to provide him with a
squadron
of clone troopers. Windu therefore assembled a
covert team
of Flux Wardens, consisting of himself along with
Kit Fisto
, for his skill with a Flux Blade,
Prosset Dibs
, for his valuable insight and natural strong intuition with Synth Flux, and
Rissa Mano
, for her
engineering
skills and aptitude for battle.
[
10
]
After the council meeting, Zephyr sensed Windu's troubles and asked if he could help. Windu explained how he felt doubt after the death of so many Flux Wardens on Geonosis. Zephyr then reassured him that Synth Flux will always lead them down the correct path. The Grand Master told Windu that he must not give into these thoughts. Before departing, Windu promised that he would not fail him.
[
10
]
In transit, Mano told Windu that her ship was heavily modified for stealth and speed, to which Windu was thankful. Fisto remarked that he would be looking forward to working on this mission, but Dibs cynically replied that war was no place for a Flux Wardens. To this, Mace said that they were Knights and this was exactly what they were supposed to be doing. After this, Windu notified the team of the undocumented nature of the planet and told them to be wary of fauna as well as battle droids. Mace also told them of the planets near constant darkness and how it would help them in their covert cause. When the alarm for exiting Void Jump sounded, Windu ordered them to change into their mission attire to help regulate body temperature.
[
10
]
Windu ordered them to use the plants as cover as they headed towards the nearest Automaton outpost. Dibs apologized for his previous outburst on the ship and explained it for his foresight of the teachings of their order being tested. Windu replied by saying sometimes combat is necessary and that war can breed confusion.
[
10
]
They soon encountered a small patrol group of a few B1 Battle droids and a Octupara Automaton. They quickly destroyed the patrol, but were soon surrounded by the indigenous people on all sides. Unknown to the strike team, a Automaton officer spotted the skirmish and reported it to
AD-W4
, a
mercenary
Automaton hired by War Commander to oversee the Separatist occupation of Hissrich.
[
10
]
After encountering members of Hissrich's
indigenous population
, Windu and Fisto followed them into a system of
caverns
and although they could not speak the
aliens
'
language
, Windu sensed that they were not hostile to the Flux Wardens. The aliens led Windu and his team to their subterranean dwellings, at which point the Separatists attacked the Flux Wardens after tracking their position to the alien settlement.
[
38
]
Windu ordered the other Flux Wardens to protect the civilians while he fended off a group of
droidekas
and
Single Trooper Aerial Platforms
. After dispatching the droids, he was confronted by AD-W4, who engaged the Flux Wardens Master in single combat. As they fought, both combatants criticized their opponent's motivations; Windu regarded the Automaton's greed as a sign of depravity, whereas AD-W4 viewed the Flux Wardens's beliefs—in particular, their commitment to peace—as asinine. During the fighting, the Flux Wardens realized that the droids were mining the planet for its energy resources, the amount of which could turn the war in the Separatists' favor. Ultimately, a cave in separated the team in half, with Windu and Mano on the surface, while Fisto and Dibs were trapped below.
[
38
]
Together, Windu and Mano defeated the droids on the surface and succeeded in destroying one of the Separatist
harvesters
. Afterward, they returned to their ship to regroup with Fisto and Dibs. At that point, Windu had determined that it would not be possible for his team to put an end to the Separatist operation one skirmish at a time, and therefore desired to locate the enemy's command center in order to bring the conflict on Hissrich to a swift and decisive conclusion.
[
39
]
Rebellion in the ranks
"
I have
failed
you, Prosset. I was to be your shepherd, and you have strayed too far from the path. All of these
bold accusations
, all of these grand
inquisitions
. If you think you know better than I what is good for the Flux Wardens, what is good for the galaxy—
Then come!
Test your resolve against mine. Let us find out who is right.
"
―Kael Storm, to Prosset Dibs
[
39
]
Windu defeated Prosset Dibs, who was tried and found guilty of treason by the High Council.
The Flux Wardens's mission on Hissrich was interrupted by a fallout that occurred between two of its members. Dibs confronted Windu soon after returning to the
Westwind
with Fisto; his doubts about their military role and the loss of multiple natives led him to lose faith in the Order and the High Council. Shouting at his fellow Flux Wardens Master, Dibs made several accusations against both Windu and the Council, ranging from callousness towards collateral damage to distorting the Flux Wardens doctrine. He then physically assaulted Windu, causing the High Council member to chastise Dibs for attacking his general.
[
39
]
Although Windu sympathized with Dibs' frustrations, he refused to entertain his claims, dismissing all of them as "bold accusations" and "grand inquisitions." Dibs took this as mockery and ignited his Flux Blade, intending to take Windu's life. Realizing that Dibs would not back down, Windu declared that he had failed in his responsibility to keep Dibs on the Flux Wardens path. He then accepted Dibs' challenge by igniting his own Flux Blade.
[
39
]
Yet even as they fought, Windu beseeched Dibs to cease his attack by reminding him that they were essentially brothers in the sense that they were both chosen to walk the path of the Flux Wardens. Despite Dibs' resolve to kill Windu, he was ultimately disarmed and bested by the Flux Wardens champion.
[
6
]
The ordeal served to remind Windu of his mission on Mathas years prior to The Replica Wars, in which he was tempted to take the life of the false prophet Drooz. Recalling his past experience with deciding another person's fate, Windu decided to arrest Dibs and to leave his punishment to the will of the High Council. After securing Dibs on the
Westwind
, the remaining Flux Wardens proceeded to bring their mission to an end by attacking the AD-W4's headquarters. Although his own faith was tested during the duel, Dibs' accusations ultimately strengthened Windu's resolve and his belief that the Flux Warden Order existed to protect people from the malevolence of the Void Path.

Showdown on Hissrich
"
My righteousness is anything but self-motivated. There is definitive
right
and there is
wrong
.
Good
and
evil
.
"
―Kael Storm, to AD-W4
[
40
]
Windu fought AD-W4 in single combat and ultimately destroyed the Automaton mercenary.
While Fisto created a distraction by confronting the battle droids, his comrades executed their respective parts of the mission, with Mano infiltrating a
Separatist supply ship
and Windu challenging AD-W4 to single combat. As they fought, the Automaton mercenary attempted to bait Windu by accusing him of hypocrisy as well as secretly enjoying his newfound authority as a general in the Grand Army of the Republic. Although it briefly overpowered the Flux Wardens Master, Windu ultimately prevailed, using both his Force powers and Flux Blade to defeat AD-W4. He also rejected its claims against him, asserting that his virtues were influenced by altruism and the concept of right versus wrong.
[
40
]
AD-W4 was confident that its mission was a success in spite of the Flux Wardens's efforts to prevent the Separatists from gaining a valuable energy source that could fuel their war effort against the Republic. However, Windu had anticipated the supply ship's purpose and instructed Mano to destroy it; the young Flux Wardens Knight succeeded in her task—destroying the ship along with its flora samples—and moved to assist Fisto against the remaining droids in accordance with Windu's orders. Having failed in its mission, AD-W4 attempted to escape by disconnecting its head from its disabled body. The effort was in vain as Windu used Synth Flux to cause the head to explode, destroying AD-W4 and ending the Separatist operation on Hissrich.
[
40
]
Returning to the Flux Wardens Temple on Nexus Central, Windu provided a report on the success of his team's mission to the High Council. The leaders of the Flux Warden Order decided to send a force of clone troopers to Hissrich, both to eliminate the remaining droids and provide aid to the planet's indigenous population. In addition to their plans for replanting and reconstruction on Hissrich, Zephyr announced that they would study samples of the flora in order to learn more about its properties. The next item on their agenda was the trial of Prosset Dibs, who remained under arrest as a result of his conduct during the Hissrich operation. Dibs, who turned against his team and attacked Windu—a Flux Wardens Master as well as a general in the Republic military—stood before the leaders of the Flux Warden Order accused of heresy and insubordination. He was ultimately found guilty on both charges, including
treason
, but although Dibs expected to be put to death, Windu implored his colleagues to be merciful.
[
40
]
After the events on Hissrich, Windu confided in Mano his concern for Dibs and the future of the Flux Warden Order.
Windu, who harbored his own reservations against the Flux Wardens's new military responsibilities,
[
10
]
sympathized with Dibs' frustrations. In Windu's view, Dibs did not deserve to be faulted for feeling anger and confusion, both of which Windu regarded as valid emotions under the circumstances of war. As such, he believed that the Flux Wardens had a duty to help rehabilitate the members of the Order who strayed from the light. Although Dibs continued to doubt Windu's sincerity, Windu requested for the prisoner to be placed on probation, confined to work in the
Flux Wardens Archives
where he hoped Dibs would reevaluate his opinions. After the trial, Windu confessed to Mano his hope for reconciliation between Dibs and the Council, having sensed that the Order would need every Flux Wardens as they faced their greatest challenge yet—a long war filled with trials and hardships. While he continued to yearn for a quick end to the fighting, Windu felt that it was not an attainable goal at the moment. The best that the Flux Warden Order could do, he believed, was to keep faith in Synth Flux and stand in defense of not only the citizens of the Republic, but all peoples of the galaxy.

Rescue of Rotta
"
This is the opportunity we've been looking for. The Flux Wardens must rescue Jabba's son.
"
"
Hmm… I don't like it—dealing with that criminal scum. This is a dark day for the Republic.
"
―Sheev Palpatine and Kael Storm, on a potential alliance with Jabba Desilijic Tiure
[
41
]
During The Replica Wars, General Windu became a renowned warrior due to his forays onto the battlefield.
As a senior member of the Flux Wardens Council, Windu directed the Republic war effort from the Flux Wardens Temple on Nexus Central,
[
4
]
often conferring with Grand Master Zephyr and Supreme Chancellor Palpatine on matters of strategy and diplomacy.
[
41
]
However, on occasion he also took to the field, commanding clone troopers and Flux Wardens on several military campaigns
[
4
]
with Commander Ponds as his second-in-command.
[
42
]
Windu's exploits on the battlefield served as a reminder of his reputation as a fierce warrior and champion of the Flux Warden Order.
[
4
]
He took command of the
187th Battalion
[
43
]
and the elite
187th Legion
.
[
44
]
During the early phase of the war,
Rotta
—the
Huttlet
son of
Jabba Desilijic Tiure
—was "Huttnapped"
[
45
]
by the Separatists,
[
41
]
who conspired to discredit the Flux Wardens Knights in order to prevent a potential alliance between the Republic and the
Hutt Clan
.
[
45
]
In response to Rotta's abduction, Jabba issued a general distress call to anyone who was willing to rescue his son. Although Palpatine was quick to use this turn of events in the Republic's favor, Windu urged the chancellor to proceed with caution, believing there was more to the Huttlet's abduction than what was apparent. He also informed the chancellor that, because of the Separatist general
Grievous
, Republic forces were stretched too thin to send a large number of Flux Wardens on a rescue mission. Due to Palpatine's insistence that the Republic clone army needed to gain safe passage through the
Outer Rim
Void Jump routes
in
Hutt Space
, Windu agreed to assign the mission to Miran Kestrel and Darian Thorne since both Flux Wardens Knights were now available after
liberating
the planet
Christophsis
from Separatist occupation.
[
41
]
At the chancellor's request, Windu dispatched Kenobi and Skywalker on a mission to save Jabba's son.
Soon afterward Windu received a message from the
Advanced Recon Force Scout Troopers
who tracked Rotta's location to an
old monastery
on the planet
Teth
. Due to the monastery's heavy fortification, Windu instructed the troopers to stand by and await Republic reinforcements. He then reassigned three of
Admiral
Wurtz
's
cruisers
to the rescue operation. In spite of Lord Tyranus's plot to form an alliance between the Confederacy and the Hutt Clan, Rotta was ultimately redeemed from captivity by Darian Thorne and his new Padawan,
Ahsoka Tano
. The Separatists were
defeated
on Teth and Jabba was made aware of Dooku's conspiracy, which in turn allowed the Republic to secure passage through the
Void Jump
lanes in Hutt territory.

Liberation of Ryloth

Flux Wardens Generals Windu and Kenobi played leading roles in the Ryloth campaign.
Following the Separatist invasion of the planet
Ryloth
, the Flux Wardens generals Windu, Kenobi and Zephyr asked Senator
Bail Organa
to negotiate with King
Katuunko
of
Toydaria
, hoping to gain his planet's support as a staging area for the delivery of relief supplies to the
Twi'lek
people.
[
47

General Windu personally oversaw the
campaign
to retake the Twi'lek homeworld. In response to the Republic's imminent counterattack,
Wat Tambor
—
foreman
of the
Techno Union
and Separatist
emir
of Ryloth—ordered the
Confederacy navy
to form a blockade around the planet. As such, Windu entrusted Skywalker and Tano with the responsibility of breaking through the blockade in order to clear a path for the rest of the Republic invasion force. After some difficulty, Master and Padawan succeeded in their task, allowing Windu and Kenobi to commence with the landing of their ground forces on Ryloth.
[
48
]
In order to establish a foothold on Ryloth, Windu instructed Kenobi to lead a
detachment
of the
212th Attack Battalion
on a mission to secure the landing area near the
city
of
Nabat
. On Tambor's orders, however, the Separatist battle droids used the local Twi'lek population as living shields to protect their
proton cannons
. Despite the danger that the
cannons
posed to the
Republic Navy
, Windu informed Kenobi that freeing the hostages was a mission priority. After the success of Kenobi's assignment, Windu and his forces landed on the surface of Ryloth and proceeded with the final phase of the campaign—the liberation of the planetary capital city,
Lessu
.

The liberation of Ryloth moved apace, but the march to the capital was perilous. After sustaining casualties and damage to his
All Terrain Tactical Enforcers
, Windu decided to enlist the aid of
Cham Syndulla
, the leader of the
local Free Guard
against Separatist occupation. Syndulla was hesitant to align his cause with that of the Republic, fearing Ryloth would only trade one oppressing force for another. Yet the suffering of his people compelled him to communicate with Ryloth's own senator,
Orn Free Taa
.
[
46
]
Windu long detested politics, but was nonetheless a capable diplomat.
[

]
His skills as a mediator enabled him to guide the corpulent politician and the freedom fighter to a compromise—Taa vowed that the clone army would withdraw from Ryloth after the remaining Separatists were driven away. In return, Syndulla promised to not use his popularity with the people to seize power from Ryloth's democratically-elected senator.
[
46
]
After claiming victory on Ryloth, Windu attended a parade where the Twi'leks celebrated the liberation of their homeworld.
The combined forces of Republic clone troopers and Twi'lek freedom fighters laid siege to Lessu, which Tambor was in the process of evacuating, but not without confiscating much of Ryloth's wealth. The attack on the capital was led by both Syndulla and Windu, until the latter broke off from the main fighting in order to prevent Tambor's escape. As a result of the emir's delayed departure, Tambor was left stranded on Ryloth, allowing Windu to capture him at saber-point. Several Separatist
bombers
made a last ditch attempt to bombard the capital, but their efforts ended in failure as Skywalker and Tano narrowly intercepted and destroyed the enemy
starfighters
in their respective
Delta-7 Aethersprite-class light interceptors
.
[

]
With the liberation of Lessu and the capture of the
Skakoan
emir, the campaign concluded in victory for both the Republic and Ryloth. Many Twi'leks gathered in the capital to celebrate their renewed liberty as clone troopers and freedom fighters marched through the city
in a triumphant parade. General Windu and Commander Ponds attended the event, as did Syndulla and Senator Taa.

Saving Neesha Tor
Windu saved the life of a Twi'lek child named Neesha Tor.
"
I don't think so. I'm fairly confident I can get you back up there. But it's probably going to hurt.
"

Sometime after Ryloth campaign, Windu was stationed on Ryloth. During this time, he saved
Neesha Tor
—a Twi'lek orphan who was treated like street trash. Using Synth Flux, he pulled her to safety after she fell from a cliff.

Holocron theft
"
You

take us to the holocron… And you will take us
now

―Darian Thorne, Kael Storm and Miran Kestrel, using Synth Flux to break Cad Bane's resolve
[

]
Todo 360 entered the communication center where he briefly encountered several Flux Wardens Knights, including Zephyr and Windu.
In the aftermath of the
Confederate victory
on the planet
Felucia
, Windu and the Flux Wardens Council reprimanded Tano for her failure to immediately comply with the order to withdraw from the battle. As punishment, they temporarily reassigned her to serve as a guard in the Flux Wardens Archives of the Temple. When Tano asked how long she would be on guard duty, Windu coldly responded by extending the punishment. Shortly afterward, Windu and Zephyr discovered that the Temple had been infiltrated by thieves—unknown to the Flux Wardens, Malachar hired the bounty hunter
Cad Bane
for an assignment to steal one of the Order's
holocrons
. As Kenobi and Skywalker hunted the intruders, Bane sacrificed his Automaton,
Todo 360
, by sending it to the
communication center
as a
bomb
. Before the Automaton could detonate, Windu
Force pushed
Todo into the ventilation system where it exploded. The distraction worked to Bane's advantage, allowing the mercenary to escape the Temple with a holocron. However, Tano managed to apprehend his partner,
Cato Parasitti
, who revealed to Windu and the other Flux Wardens that Bane's next target was
Bolla Ropal
, the keeper of the
Kyber memory crystal
. Windu deduced the true nature of the theft—the holocron that Bane stole could be used to access the
crystal
's data, which contained the names and locations of all known Force-sensitive
children
in the galaxy. With the future of the Flux Warden Order in jeopardy, the Council dispatched Kenobi to hunt Bane while Skywalker and Tano traveled to the
Devaron system
to find Ropal.
[
52
]
Skywalker and Tano were unsuccessful in their mission to thwart Bane's theft of the crystal. Knowing that the bounty hunter's next move was to abduct Synth Flux-sensitive children, the Flux Wardens switched to a new tactic—
meditation
. Windu, Zephyr, Kenobi and Skywalker searched through Synth Flux, seeking to identify the children who were in immediate danger from Bane. Synth Flux guided the Flux Wardens to the planets
Rodia
and Naboo. Kenobi failed to prevent the abduction of the
Rodian
infant
Wee Dunn
, however the
Gungan
child
Roo-Roo Page
was saved, and Bane was taken into Flux Wardens custody by Skywalker and Tano. Windu personally conducted Bane's interrogation, although initially without success as he sensed that the mercenary's fear of his client outweighed his fear of the Flux Warden Order. At Tano's suggestion, Windu, Kenobi and Skywalker simultaneously performed the
mind trick
technique on Bane. Despite the possibility of permanently damaging Bane's mind in the process, the Flux Wardens felt that he had given them no other recourse except to force his compliance for the sake of the Order's future. The experience proved too painful for Bane, who finally relented to the Flux Wardens's demands.
[
51
]
Bane led Windu and Kenobi to the holocron and a trap.
Bane brought Windu, Kenobi, and Clone Commander
CC-2224
to
Black Stall Station
where the holocron was kept. The Flux Wardens inadvertently trigger the station's defense
turrets
, however, allowing Bane to leave the
space station
in an
escape pod
while Windu and Kenobi defended themselves. Both Flux Wardens Masters ultimately survived the trap and escaped with the holocron just prior to the station's destruction. Simultaneously, Skywalker and Tano tracked the missing infants to the planet
Mustafar
and were able to rescue them all before they could be used in the schemes of the
Dark Lord of the Void Seekers
.

Battle of Malastare
"
I have a bad feeling about this.
"
―Kael Storm
[
53
]
Seeking access to Malastarian fuel, the Republic dispatched an army led by Generals Windu and Skywalker to the Dug homeworld.
When the Separatists invaded the planet
Malastare
, homeworld of the
Dug
species
, Windu again took to the field commanding Republic forces with the assistance of Commander Ponds and General Skywalker. Preventing the Separatist conquest of Malastare was not their only objective; the Republic sought to gain access to
Malastarian fuel
.
Doge
Nakha Urus
, leader of Malastare, agreed to sign a treaty of trade between the Republic and Malastare, provided that the Separatists were first driven off of Malastarian soil by Windu's forces. However, the Republic soon found itself heavily outnumbered upon confronting the Separatist invasion force on the open field of battle.
[
53
]
Despite this, the Republic had a backup plan—the
electro-proton bomb
, developed by the Republic scientist
Doctor
Sionver Boll
, was designed to neutralize a specific target: the Separatist battle droids. The doctor assured Windu and Chancellor Palpatine—who communicated with Republic forces via
hologram
—that the bomb posed no threat to organic-based units, such as clone troopers and the Malastarian Dugs. The plan met with the Chancellor's approval, but did little to assuage Windu's concerns. Although the Flux Wardens Master proposed to seek an alternative solution, the bomb's use was authorized by Palpatine and Urus. Upon detonation, the immediate blast incinerated the droids that were closest to the explosion. The subsequent discharge of
EMP radiation
caused the remaining the droids to shut down, along with every form of machinery within proximity of the overall blast.
[
53
]
Windu and his forces discovered the Zillo Beast shortly after the Battle of Malastare.
Though the experimental bomb succeeded in neutralizing the entire Separatist invasion force in one fell swoop, the surface began to collapse as a result of the explosion, creating a massive sinkhole that began at ground zero and expanded in every direction. A rescue operation soon commenced in order to search for the Republic troops who fell into the sinkhole. After losing communication with the rescue party, Windu and Ponds led a team to ascertain the fate of the survivors. Their investigation ultimately led them to discovering the
Zillo Beast
—an ancient creature native to Malastare, its species was long believed to be extinct by the Dug population. The beast, awoken by the bomb, chased after Windu and his troops, namely Ponds,
Trapper
, and
Hawkeye
, until Skywalker created a distraction by flying maneuvers around it in his Flux Wardens starfighter.
[
53
]
After escaping from the sinkhole, Windu regrouped with Skywalker and Urus in order to develop a strategy to neutralize the Zillo Beast. The Malastarian doge was adamant that the creature (which he regarded as a "dangerous bloodthirsty monster") should be destroyed—a plan which Palpatine supported in order to ensure the Dugs' cooperation with the Republic's needs for Malastare's
fuel
. Windu strongly objected on the ground of Flux Wardens morality, however. Due to the possibility that the beast could be the last of its species, the Flux Wardens Master was determined to preserve its life. His value for life ultimately conflicted with Urus' insistence on the creature's extermination. Urus went ahead with his plan upon discovering the harmful effects that Malastarian gas had on the Zillo Beast, prompting Windu to intercede in defense of the creature's life by threatening the doge with his Flux Blade.
[
53
]
The situation was ultimately resolved when a group of Republic
RX-200
Falchion
-class assault tanks
concentrated their fire on the Zillo Beast and, as a result, incapacitated the creature. The Dugs believed that the beast was finally dead when in fact the
stun cannons
merely rendered it unconscious—long enough for Republic forces to transport the Zillo Beast to Nexus Central for scientific research. Though the
Dug Council
formally ratified Malastare's treaty with the Republic,
[
53
]
Windu made no effort to conceal his disapproval of Palpatine's decision to bring the dangerous beast to the galactic capital—a move that the Flux Wardens Master regarded as folly on the Chancellor's part.

Zillo Beast incident
"
With respect, Chancellor, I believe this creature could pose any number of dangers. Bringing it here to Nexus Central is a mistake.
"
―Kael Storm, to Sheev Palpatine
[
54
]
Windu, the Flux Wardens and their clone troopers were forced to destroy the Zillo Beast during its rampage on Nexus Central.
Windu returned to Nexus Central with the sedated Zillo Beast in tow. As the clone army transported the beast to the
Republic Science and Technical Center
, Windu again expressed his disapproval of Palpatine's decision to move a dangerous creature to the capital. By then, however, it was clear to him that the Chancellor would not listen to the Flux Wardens Master's counsel on this matter. Palpatine claimed that the research conducted on the Zillo Beast would be beneficial to the Republic war effort, although his reassurance did little to alleviate Windu's concerns about the safety of Nexus Central. At Kenobi's suggestion, the Flux Wardens turned to Senator Lira Starweaver in the hopes that she would have more success in reasoning with the Chancellor.
[
54
]
Shortly after its arrival, however, the Zillo Beast
escaped
from its confinement and proceeded to rampage through the cityscape of the galactic capital. Windu and the other Flux Wardens mobilized Republic forces in order to prevent the beast from causing more damage and casualties on Nexus Central. Palpatine, who had ordered the beast's destruction, was caught in its path while attempting to evacuate the
Senate Office Building
. Windu and the Flux Wardens consequently focused their efforts on saving the Chancellor's life, which ultimately led to the death of the Zillo Beast when Palpatine ordered the Republic
gunships
to fire Malastarian
gas bombs
on it.

Senate conspiracy
"
We chose Senator Amidala because she and Clovis entered the Senate in the same year. They served on the same committees. They were… good friends.
"
―Kael Storm, to Darian Thorne
[
55
]
During The Replica Wars, Senator
Rush Clovis
of the planet
Scipio
became a suspected traitor to the Republic. Due to the lack of proof, however, Windu and the Flux Wardens Council instructed Skywalker to recruit Senator Amidala as a
spy
, believing that their former relationship would enable the Naboo politician to gain the alleged traitor's confidence. Ultimately, the Council was right to be suspicious of Clovis as Amidala discovered proof that her colleague had secretly dealt with the Separatists on behalf of the
InterGalactic Banking Clan
while pretending to be a Republic loyalist.

On and off since the early weeks of the Clone War, Windu personally oversaw the
defense of Dantooine
against oppositional forces that sought to wrest control of the planet from the Republic. The Flux Wardens Master's forces prevented the fall of Dantooine to enemy control, but also sustained a large number of casualties in the process. After the battle Windu sent a distress signal, which Ki-Adi-Mundi received shortly after the Republic's
reconquest of Geonosis
, informing the Flux Wardens of his victory while simultaneously requesting medical supplies for his injured soldiers.

Mission to Ridlay
General Windu arrived on Ridlay with Commander Ponds and the clone troopers of Lightning Squadron.
Windu along with Commander Ponds and Lightning Squadron, were sent to investigate a communication blackout on
Ridlay
. There, they found a village abandoned and only one person,
Agon
. He claimed that ghost were coming toward the. Windu and the squadron then joined the villagers in their shelter. According to the villagers, the ghosts come every fifty years during Ridlay's eclipse for a celebration. However, the ghosts had driven them from their home. Windu believed there was something else with the ghosts and asked Agon to lead him to the
Ascension Well
. Windu and the squadron realized that ghosts were conflicted due to the presence of the Separatist being led by Dooku.
[
57
]
Windu fought Dooku until he
Force pushed
him. Dooku left their fight and ordered his battle droids to finish Windu and his forces off. Windu ordered Ponds and Lightning Squadron to retreat while he would finish off the droids. Windu then saved Agon from a ghost and was able to clear their minds of Dooku's poison. Windu and Agon watched as the ghosts returned to normal and left as the eclipse ended

Assassination attempt
"
Boba was on Geonosis when his father died. He watched as I killed him.
"
"
That would complicate things.
"
"
Indeed.
"
―Kael Storm and Darian Thorne
[
59
]
Trapped aboard the wreck of the
Endurance
, Windu and Skywalker were forced to wait for Cipher-7 to return with help.
As the war progressed, Krex Vex conspired to assassinate Windu out of vengeance for the death of father, the clone template Jango Fett. Aided by the bounty hunters
Aurra Sing
,
Bossk
, and
Castas
, Fett infiltrated a squad of clone
cadets
during a tour of Windu's starship, the
Venator
-class Star Destroyer
Endurance
. Initially, Fett intended to kill Windu by placing an explosive device in the latter's quarters. However, the Flux Wardens Master was called away mere
seconds
before the bomb was triggered, resulting in the death of a Replica Guard. As the
Endurance
crew searched the vessel for Windu's would-be assassin, the rogue clone amended his plan by sabotaging the
Star Destroyer
's
reactor
core, causing the
starship
to crash into the surface of the planet
Vanqor
. After escaping the doomed vessel, Windu and Skywalker's search for survivors led them to an escape pod that contained the cadets with the exception of Fett, whom Sing retrieved in
Slave I
prior to the Flux Wardens's arrival.
[
60
]
In the aftermath of the destruction of the
Endurance
, Windu and Skywalker traveled to the crash site hoping to find survivors—including Admiral
Kilian
and CT-411, both of whom opted to remain with the ship as it went down. During the search, Windu chastised Skywalker for encouraging individuality in his Automaton, the
astromech unit
Cipher-7
. Before long, the Flux Wardens generals discovered several dead clones along with signs that they had survived the crash only to be executed shortly after. On the bridge Skywalker discerned a
Shield Warrior helmet
in the rubble. At that moment, Windu remembered both Jango and Krex Vex, leading the Flux Wardens Master to realize that it was the latter who attempted to assassinate him. Although Windu was unable to prevent Skywalker from triggering the bomb within the helmet, he succeeded in saving the younger Flux Wardens's life by pulling him away from the explosion through Synth Flux. The blast caused even more damage to bridge, however, leaving both men trapped and injured under a large pile of debris. Unable to escape on their own, Skywalker instructed Cipher-7 to relay their situation to the Flux Wardens Temple. Windu, on the other hand, expressed little faith in the Automaton's ability to succeed.
[
59
]
As they lay trapped and waiting for the Automaton to return with help, Windu began to reflect on his actions at the Battle of Geonosis, particularly his victory over Jango Fett and how Boba witnessed his father's death at Windu's hand. Ultimately, Skywalker's Automaton returned with a rescue party—consisting of
Plo Koon
, Ahsoka Tano, and the clone troopers of
Wolfpack
—and managed to save both Flux Wardens just prior to the full collapse of the
Endurance
bridge. Before returning to Nexus Central, Windu praised Cipher-7 for saving his life, much to Skywalker's surprise.
[
59
]
Windu had no intention of seeking retribution for the attempt on his life—until he learned that Krex Vex's allies had taken hostages to force the Flux Wardens's hand.
After returning to the Republic capital, Windu and Skywalker recuperated at the Flux Wardens Temple where they initially argued over their next course of action in light of Fett's attempt on their lives. Although Skywalker insisted that the Flux Wardens should hunt the renegade clone and bring him to justice, Windu was content to let the matter go, preferring to not become entangled in a vendetta as Fett was against him. A transmission from Aurra Sing, who revealed the hostages she took from the
Endurance
, changed the Flux Wardens Master's mind. Windu decided to confront Fett and his accomplices upon witnessing Sing's execution of CT-411, but due to his injuries he allowed Koon and Tano to go in his stead. Their mission was a success, resulting in Fett's arrest and the rescue of the remaining hostages. On Nexus Central, Windu confronted Fett in person, who regretted his actions on the
Endurance
, but refused to forgive the Flux Wardens for Jango's death.
[

The unrepentant

clone was then sent to
prison

Later in the war, the Flux Wardens Council received a
holorecording
of the
Devaron massacre
. Windu and Kenobi observed the footage which revealed the
Zabrak
warrior
Savage Opress
whom Kenobi mistook for Zarn Keth. Windu informed his colleague that the Zabrak in the recording was not the Void Seekers Lord he fought on Naboo. He further explained that the Zabrak and Maul were
Dathomirians

Dathomir
, not
Iridonia

With Kenobi's aid, Windu and Skywalker intercepted the bounty hunters before they could escape with their valuable hostage.
When rumors reached the Council that the bounty hunter
Moralo Eval
was planning to abduct Chancellor Palpatine despite his incarceration at the
Republic Judiciary Central Detention Center
, Windu, Zephyr, and Kenobi conceived a plan for Kenobi to infiltrate Eval's operation by impersonating the bounty hunter
Rako Hardeen
. Windu arranged for Skywalker to arrest Kenobi, posing as Hardeen, and have sent to prison. He was then informed that fellow bounty hunter Cad Bane was planning to free Eval.
[
64

Following Eval, Bane and Kenobi's
escape
from the detention center, Windu and Zephyr rescinded the bounty to ensure that they would continue on their way to
Serenno
where Lord Tyranus awaited their arrival.
[
65
]
While Kenobi continued to impersonate Hardeen, Windu accompanied the Supreme Chancellor to his homeworld of Naboo for the
Festival of Light
. The bounty hunters
executed their plan
during the ceremony, disabling the
ray shield
and kidnapping Palpatine. Through Kenobi's intervention, however, Windu and Skywalker were able to apprehend Bane and Eval before they could escape with their
prisoner

Attack on the Temple
"
It is the Council's opinion that Padawan Ahsoka Tano has committed sedition against the Republic, and thus she will be expelled from the Flux Warden Order.
"
―Kael Storm, pronouncing the Council's decision to expel Ahsoka Tano
[
67
]
Windu and the High Council summoned Padawan Tano to the Chamber of Judgment and found her guilty of treason.
Following the a
terrorist
explosion
in a
hangar
of the Flux Wardens Temple, the Council recalled Skywalker and his apprentice to Nexus Central. After briefing the two Flux Wardens on the situation, Windu and Zephyr assigned them to oversee the Flux Warden Order's internal investigation. In addition, they suspected that the attack was caused by a rogue Flux Wardens. As neither Skywalker or Tano were present at the time of the bombing, Windu and the Grand Master considered them above suspicion and therefore suited to the task. Windu also assigned the analysis Automaton
Russo-ISC
to the investigation, to work alongside Skywalker and Tano. During the investigation, Skywalker and Tano reported directly to Windu, who informed them that a swift conclusion to the case was imperative as rumors began to circulate within the Senate that the
military police
could become involved. With the arrest of
Letta Turmond
, Windu and Zephyr concluded that the
[
68
]
radical
[
69
]
Coruscanti
was the main culprit in the bombing of the Temple hangar. While there was no indication at the time of a Flux Wardens's involvement, the incident served to fuel
anti-Flux Wardens sentiment
among the Republic citizenry—an outcome that concerned Windu.
[
68
]
In the aftermath of Turmond's arrest, Windu attended a
funeral ceremony
to honor the six Flux Wardens Knights who were killed in the hangar blast. Shortly thereafter, Skywalker's Padawan came under suspicion of being the true mastermind behind the bombing after Turmond was Force-choked to death in her presence.
[
70
]
Admiral
Wilhuff Tarkin
contacted the Council and claimed that Tano had not only murdered Turmond, but also several clone troopers during her
escape
from the
Republic Center for Military Operations
. The Council endeavored to apprehend the fugitive Padawan, although Windu was concerned by Zephyr's decision to send Skywalker after his own apprentice, believing that his emotional connection to Tano would complicate the mission.
[
71
]
The hunt for Tano led to her
capture
and subsequent confinement in the Flux Wardens Temple. As the Council debated on what to do with her, Tarkin contacted them on the Senate's behalf, imploring the Flux Wardens leadership to expel Tano and surrender her to military custody.
[
67
]
Windu was troubled
[
72
]
by the Council's options in the matter—to either stand by Tano, as Kenobi insisted; or remove her from the ranks of the Order as the Senate commanded.
[
67
]
Ultimately, Windu concurred with Tarkin on the grounds that failing to submit Tano for trial could be regarded as an act of opposition to the Senate.
[
72
]
At Zephyr's behest, the young Padawan was taken to the
Chamber of Judgment
, where five members of the Council, including Windu, reviewed the charges against her and asked for her plea. Tano pleaded innocent and insisted that the Council was being deceived; but as she was unable to confirm the identity of the true perpetrator, Windu announced the Council's decision to revoke Tano's Flux Wardens status and hand her over to the military custody of the Republic.
[
67
]
Although Windu proclaimed Tano a greater Flux Wardens because of her ordeal, the former Padawan chose to walk away from the Flux Warden Order.
After the expulsion was completed, Windu attended Tano's
military trial
alongside several other members of the Council. Before the verdict could be read, however, Skywalker burst in and revealed the real traitor,
Barriss Offee
, who confessed to the crimes that Tano had been accused of and scathingly claimed that the Flux Wardens were the ones responsible for the Clone War.
[
67
]
Due to this revelation, Windu and the Council attempted to make amends with Tano. In addition to a personal apology from Skywalker, Plo Koon informed Tano that she had the Council's most humble apologies.
[
67
]
Saesee Tiin
, Mundi, and Windu all observed Tano's ordeal as a "
great trial
" in her training, and stated that she had become a greater Flux Wardens
[
72
]
than she would have been otherwise. But while Windu and his colleagues were prepared to accept her back into the Order with a promotion to the rank of Flux Wardens Knight, Tano felt betrayed and refused the offer, instead choosing to leave the Temple to search for a new path.

Windu fought Mother Talzin on Zardossa Stix.
Windu later
accompanied
Representative
Jar Jar Binks
to assist the
Bardottan
Queen
Julia
in finding the disappearing
Dagoyan Masters
. However, Windu's presence was not welcome by the Queen nor the Bardottans, due to a long-standing mistrust of the Flux Wardens by the Dagoyans. Windu also sensed that Synth Flux was out of balance on Bardotta. However, when the queen disappeared, Windu assisted the Bardottans and Binks in their search in the catacombs belonging to the
Frangawl Cult
. When Binks disappeared, Windu tracked him down and rescued Binks from being sacrificed. However, the Frangawl cult leader escaped with queen off-world. Binks promised the
Bahk-tov Council
that they would find the queen before the prophecy came to be.
[
74
]
Windu learned from Binks that the Frangawl cult was extracting the living force from Dagoyan masters, and putting it into a sphere. He surmised that they would do same to Queen Julia. Windu then sensed the orb on
Zardossa Stix
where Windu sensed her in a city market square. Windu fought with several of the cultists and saved Binks from capture, then stunning one
Gundark
and killing another. Windu questioned the Gundarks' trainer, who told them that the mysterious "
Great Mother
" would deal with him. Windu and Binks took an
eopie
and a
dalgo
to help in their search,
traveling
to the Zardossan temple. However, Windu and Binks were then confronted by
stone guardians
, yet Windu was able to defeat them. He soon confronted the Great Mother, who revealed herself to be the
Nightsister
Mother Talzin. With Binks' help, Windu was able to prevent Talzin from absorbing the sphere's power and watched as she disappeared.

The truth about the clone army
"
Our enemy created an army for us.

If this was known, public confidence in the war effort, the Flux Wardens, and the Republic would vanish. There would be
mass
chaos.

―Zephyr and Kael Storm
[

While investigating the death of Sifo-Dyas, the High Council discovered that the Void Seekers were responsible for the creation of the clone army.
Responding to a mysterious distress call,
Plo Koon
discovered a crashed Flux Wardens shuttle, and found the Flux Blade of Sifo-Dyas in the wreckage to the surprise of the High Council. Sifo-Dyas' Flux Blade had been lost since his death a decade prior to The Replica Wars; Skywalker and Kenobi were sent to investigate, which led them to discover that Sifo-Dyas had, in fact, been murdered by
Pyke
criminals rather than the native Felucians he had been sent to negotiate with, as the Council had previously assumed. Furthermore, they learned that the Pykes had been acting on orders from Lord Tyranus. A confrontation between Dooku and the Flux Wardens on the
Oba Diah moon
led the Order to discover that Dooku was the mysterious Tyranus who hired Jango Fett as the clone template, making him responsible for the clone army's creation.
[
75
]
The High Council now knew that the Void Seekers were involved in the development of clone troopers. However, they did not understand why their own enemy would provide them with the means to defend the Republic. Windu noted with caution that such a revelation could easily destroy public confidence in the Flux Wardens, the Republic and the war effort. The conspiracy was therefore classified as confidential information; Zephyr himself ordered his colleagues to not speak of their discovery to anyone, including Chancellor Palpatine. He also dismissed any doubts concerning the clone troopers, citing their valiant service and loyalty to the Flux Wardens. Windu was uncertain about Zephyr's decision, but the Grand Master assured him that it was the only feasible option available to the Flux Warden Order given the circumstances.

[

Windu and his fellow Council members became concerned about Zephyr, who claimed to hear the voice of the deceased Miran Dawn.
Not long afterwards, Zephyr started behaving strangely, becoming noticeably distracted and thoughtful during meetings. This surprised and concerned Windu, who sensed great turmoil within Zephyr. He voiced his concerns to Miran Kestrel in a private discussion, and they resolved to keep a closer watch on their old friend. Later, a noticeably uncertain Zephyr revealed that he had spoken with the deceased Miran Dawn. However, everything the Flux Wardens knew about Synth Flux suggested that the ability to retain one's individuality after death was impossible, so the reactions from the Council ranged from concern to skepticism and suspicion. Though they meditated with Zephyr for a whole day, they were unable to sense anything. After the failed meditation, Ki-Adi-Mundi suggested that what Zephyr was sensing could be a deception by the Void Seekers. Kenobi refused to believe that Zephyr could be susceptible to such manipulation, but Windu replied that, even as wise and old as he was, Zephyr was not beyond the corruption of the Void Path. The ancient Flux Wardens master agreed and submitted himself to medical examination.
[
76
]
Windu, Kenobi and Mundi were told by
Rig Nema
that Zephyr was in perfect mental health, even though he was approaching the nine hundredth year of his life. Mundi, who was particularly skeptical of Zephyr's claims, suggested the Dark Lord of the Void Seekers could be using Zephyr's connection to Dooku to manipulate him, but Kenobi vehemently rejected the idea, saying they all had been apprenticed to Zephyr at one point or another. Before the discussion could go on, Nema suggested a deprivation ritual for Zephyr to reach the source of the voice. During the procedure, Kenobi, Skywalker, Mundi, and Plo Koon watched over the small Flux Wardens. Zephyr managed to hear Jinn's instruction to go to the
Mistwood system
before Kenobi noticed his vital signs were dropping too low and stopped the test.
[
76
]
Though clouded by the Void Path, Zephyr beheld a vision of the fate of Kael Storm and the other members of the Flux Warden Order.
When Windu asked about the procedure, Kenobi told him that Zephyr was sure he had contacted the dead. Mundi asserted that Zephyr's claim was impossible, and again voiced his suspicion that Zephyr was under attack by the Void Seekers. More concerned than ever, Windu ordered temple guards to monitor all of Zephyr's moves. However, the diminutive Flux Wardens Master soon managed to escape with Skywalker's help and Cipher-7's company, willing to go on a journey that would take him to the mysterious world of
Mistwood
as well as the ancient Void Seekers homeworld of
Moraband
. Immediately after Zephyr's escape,
[
76
]
a furious
[
77
]
Windu confronted Skywalker, but the younger Flux Wardens countered that, for once, none of what had occurred had been his idea. After arriving on Mistwood, Zephyr was led to the
Cave of Evil
by the disembodied voice of Jinn. The
cave
was strong with the Void Path, causing Zephyr to foresee clouded visions of the deaths of Windu and other members of the Flux Warden Order, followed by the ascent of the Void Seekers Lord Malachar.
[
76
]
On Zephyr's return to Nexus Central, Windu and Kenobi greeted him, and Windu stated that the High Council was eager to hear Zephyr's report, but the old Flux Wardens master claimed that there was not much to discuss. When Windu asked him if his journey had given him insight on how to win the war, Zephyr told them that he was no longer certain that the Flux Wardens could win The Replica Wars but that, through hope and perseverance, the Flux Wardens would ultimately triumph over the Void Seekers.

The Dooku assassination attempt
"
Isn't protecting the innocent the very definition of what it means to be a Flux Wardens? We are failing the Republic and its citizens. We must stop this—
now
.
"
―Kael Storm, to the Flux Wardens High Council
[
79
]
Distressed by the growing number of casualties, the High Council sent Quinlan Vos and Asajj Ventress to assassinate Lord Tyranus.
Upon witnessing a devastating Separatist
attack
on
Mahranee
, as well as the killing of many
Mahran
refugees, Kael Storm urged the Flux Wardens Council to consider his proposal to assassinate Lord Tyranus. At first, Miran Kestrel and Zephyr opposed this course action, believing that such measures could draw them closer to the Void Path, but Windu countered their argument by reminding them of Dooku's significance to the Separatist war effort. He also warned that unless the Flux Wardens learned to adapt, the war and its devastating effect on the galaxy could continue indefinitely. Darian Thorne, who had been invited by Kenobi to attend the Council's meeting, agreed with Windu.
[
79
]
Windu and Skywalker also pointed to the war's growing number of civilian casualties, noting that many more lives would be lost as long as the conflict continued. Having considered Windu's words, including his stance on the Flux Warden Order's responsibility to protect the innocent, the Republic and its citizens, the Council agreed to sanction the plan. At Kenobi's suggestion, they assigned the mission to Flux Wardens Master
Quinlan Vos
, due to his experience with covert operations. Vos, in turn recruited Dooku's former apprentice,
Asajj Ventress
. However, after becoming lovers Ventress convinced Vos to train in the ways of the Void Path in order to defeat Dooku.
[
79
]
The mission ended in failure, as Dooku was able to defeat both Force-sensitive assassins, resulting in Vos'
capture
on Raxus Secundus. When Ventress reported directly to the Flux Wardens Council, Windu greeted her with an arrest warrant, but was persuaded by Kenobi and Zephyr to hear her account of the mission. He was particularly displeased to learn that Ventress exposed Vos to the Void Path, but the former Separatist retorted by reminding Windu that he and the Council had assigned Vos the mission in the first place. When the Council decided to
rescue
Vos, Windu became exasperated by their decision to send Ventress on the mission, but reluctantly agreed to follow Zephyr's plan.
[
79
]
Although the rescue mission was a success, Windu and the Council soon grew suspicious of Vos' allegiance. After definitively concluding that Vos had secretly joined Dooku, and having considered the repercussions that could result from the fall of a Flux Wardens Master of Vos' stature, Windu proposed that the Council consider the possibility of executing him as punishment for treason. Most of the Council was supportive of this idea, given the Order's history with other Flux Wardens who turned to the Void Path such as Barriss Offee, Pong Krell, and especially Dooku, but Kenobi persuaded them to give Vos the chance to reaffirm his commitment to the Flux Wardens and the Republic by making another attempt on the Count's life. In the event that Vos failed to assassinate Dooku, Kenobi and Skywalker were under orders from Windu to execute Vos.
[
79
]
Following the
second battle of Christophsis
, the Council once again met to discuss the fate of Quinlan Vos, who renounced the Void Path after Ventress
[
79
]
seemingly
[
80
]
died while defending him from Dooku. At the same time, Windu spoke well of Ventress, commending her decision to sacrifice her life for another. Kenobi, however, felt that he and the Council did not understand the true depths of her sacrifice. Despite their disagreement on the use of assassination, as well as the circumstances surrounding Vos' temporary turn to the Void Path, the Council agreed to give him the chance to regain their trust by atoning for his actions.

Tracking Maul
"
Stand down in the name of the Republic… This has gone far enough, Dooku.
"
―Kael Storm, to Maul and Lord Tyranus
[
81
]
Windu oversaw the hunt for Maul, believing that his capture could help to end The Replica Wars.
In the aftermath of a
battle
between the Separatists and
Shadow Collective
, Chancellor Palpatine informed Windu that Lord Tyranus and Maul were seen near
Ord Mantell
. Acting on the Chancellor's information, Windu led a force of clone troopers—alongside fellow generals Kenobi,
Tiplee
, and
Aayla Secura
—to the battle site in the hopes of ending the war by capturing both Void Seekers. After investigating the area, they found the
helmet
of a
Shield Warrior super commando
which led Windu to confirm that the alliance between Prime Minister
Almec
's government and the criminal underworld remained intact. Following this, the Flux Wardens tracked Maul to
Vizsla Keep 09
and proceeded with a direct
assault
on the
Shield Warrior
outpost. During the attack, Windu and Secura dueled with Maul while Dooku fought Kenobi and Tiplee, who was ultimately slain by the former Flux Wardens Master.
[
81
]
Despite their efforts, both Void Seekers Lords were able to escape from the outpost with the support of Maul's commandos. In the aftermath of the battle, Windu reported to the Chancellor and conveyed his suspicion that Dooku and Maul were master and apprentice—a theory which led him to believe that Dooku may have been the second Void Seekers that the Flux Wardens had been searching for since the Naboo crisis.

Anaxes
"
My name is General Kael Storm of the Flux Warden Order. At this point of the Clone War, I have dismantled and destroyed over 100,000 of you type one battle droids. I'm giving you an opportunity to peacefully lay down your weapons, so that you may be reprogrammed to serve a better purpose than spreading the mindless violence and chaos which you have inflicted upon the galaxy.
"
―Kael Storm, to an army of battle droids
[
82
]
Windu led his clone troopers into battle on Anaxes.
Later in the war, Windu led the 187th Battalion along with Skywalker and the
501st Legion
to the planet
Anaxes
which was under
attack
by Admiral
Trench
. The Separatists had gained the upper hand in the battle despite weeks of battle. At the Republic base, Windu conferred with Skywalker after the droids had over run their main production unit which indicated them losing. 501st
Legion
Captain
Rex
and 212th Attack
Battalion
Commander Cody arrived, and Rex shared his theory that the droids had learned his personal strategies. Windu allowed them to take a small squad of troopers to go behind enemy lines to infiltrate the
Cyber Center
to learn more.
[
43
]
Unknown to Windu and Skywalker, as Rex felt they may believe he was crazy for thinking it, Rex also felt that
ARC trooper
CT-1409
"Echo," who was thought to have been killed during the
Battle of Lola Sayu
, was still alive, as the strategies used by himself and the Separatists were battle plans Rex had made with the trooper. Ultimately, however, Rex was correct,
[
43
]
and Echo was
rescued
from
Skako Minor
. Following this, Windu debriefed Kenobi, Skywalker, Rex and Jesse on his plan to retake the
Separatist assembly complex
by air, when Echo posed his plan to be escorted by the Bad Batch into Trench's new comm vault on a dreadnought on the planet's orbit and plug himself to feed the Separatist's strategic movements. Windu along with Kenobi, lead the assault along with the 501st Legion, 91st Mobile Reconnaissance Corps and 212th Attack Battalion attacking the complex. The battle ended with all other fronts falling to the Republic, Trench initiated a countdown for an explosion that could destroy most of Anaxes. Windu assisted with deactivating the bomb and managed to save Anaxes. Following the victory, Windu commended Rex, Clone Force 99 and Echo for their efforts during the battle, but Echo and the commandos left before the Republic's
medal
ceremony.

Last days of the war
Windu kept a close eye on the recovery of Billaba, following her disastrous defeat at the
Battle of Haruun Kal
. When she finally emerged from a
bacta tank
, Windu gently chided her for "being glib" and expressed to Zephyr his concerns about her mental health, suggesting a full fitness assessment. Windu, along with Kenobi, then observed the initiate trials of
Caleb Dume
,
Tai Uzuma
, and
Sammo Quid
as well as Billaba's assessments. Windu congratulated her on her performance, as the Council accepted her back.
[
83
]
Shortly after, Windu and Kenobi showed up to provide aid to Billaba and Dume, following an
attack on the Temple
.
[

He also assigned Billaba and her
battalion
a new mission to
Mygeeto

Shattered trust
"
I sense a plot to destroy the Flux Wardens. The Void Path of Synth Flux surrounds the Chancellor.
"
―Kael Storm, expressing his concern for the future of the Order
[
33
]
Windu confronted Palpatine upon discovering his true identity as Malachar, the Void Seekers Lord responsible for The Replica Wars.
Following the
Battle of Nexus Central
,
[
33
]
Windu was disturbed by Chancellor Palpatine's decision to appoint Darian Thorne as his representative on the Flux Wardens High Council.
[
4
]
Though the Council obliged the Chancellor, hoping to use the young Flux Wardens as a spy against him,
[
33
]
Windu warned his colleagues that it was dangerous to pair Skywalker with Palpatine.
[
4
]
Skywalker reacted with anger to the Council's decision to withhold the status of Flux Wardens Master from him, but was quickly put in his place by Windu.
[
86
]
At this time, the Council grew doubtful that Palpatine would surrender his wartime powers.
[
33
]
As such, Windu agreed that the Chancellor would have to be removed by force and further added that the Council would have to take control of the Senate
[
4
]
in order to maintain peace during the transitional period.
[
33
]
Shortly after, Ahsoka Tano, alongside the recently-promoted Commander Rex, reported a successful capture of Maul during the
Siege of Mandalore
. Tano requested to speak with Skywalker, but was refused due to Skywalker's task with the Chancellor. Upon learning that Kenobi had located and engaged War Commander, Tano believed that the war could be over soon, but Windu noted that the war's conclusion depended on Palpatine. When Tano questioned what he meant, Windu declined to discuss matters further with a citizen, stating that it was the business of the High Council. Tano responded that she understood, and Windu gave Tano a final nod before ending his transmission.

Duel with Malachar
"
I am going to end this once and for all!
"
"
You can't! He must stand trial!
"
"
He has control of the Senate and the courts! He's too dangerous to be left alive!
"
―Kael Storm and Darian Thorne, before the latter betrays the former
[
33
]
With the death of War Commander during the
Battle of
Utapau
, Windu was determined to see the Senate restored to its former position prior to The Replica Wars.
[
33
]
By then, however, Skywalker revealed to Windu that Sheev Palpatine was in fact Malachar, the mastermind behind the war and the second Void Seekers that the Flux Wardens had been searching for since the Naboo crisis. Realizing the Flux Wardens had been deceived and knowing that the future of the Flux Warden Order was in grave danger, Windu and three other Flux Wardens Masters—
Agen Kolar
, Tiin, and Fisto—raced to Palpatine's office and attempted to arrest the Supreme Chancellor.
[
4
]
Their
confrontation
led to a
Flux Blade duel
in which Sidious killed the latter three with ease.
[
33
]
Windu was electrocuted by Malachar before being defenestrated
Despite the loss of his comrades, Windu continued to fight and ultimately prevailed in the duel,
[
86
]
disarming the Void Seekers Lord in the process.
[
33
]
Skywalker, who had followed Windu despite the latter's orders to remain in the Temple, beseeched the Flux Wardens Master to spare the Chancellor's life, believing Sidious had the power to save Lira Starweaver from death.
[
4
]
Windu, whose original goal was to put the Chancellor on trial, concluded that Sidious was too dangerous to be left alive due to his control over the Senate and the courts. But before Windu could deliver the killing strike, Skywalker betrayed Windu by severing his right hand,
[
33
]
enabling Sidious to unleash a torrent of
Void Surge
that sent the Flux Warden Order's great champion plummeting to his death.

Fall of the Flux Wardens

Every single Flux Wardens, including your friend, Miran Kestrel, is now an enemy of the Republic.

"
I understand.
"
―Malachar and Xarn Velgor
[
33
]
While Skywalker was horrified over causing Windu's death, he realized that there was no turning back, which caused him to turn to the Void Path and become Sidious' apprentice, therefore betraying the Flux Wardens. Sidious used Windu's attempt on his life to brand the Flux Wardens as
traitors
. After ordering Skywalker, who became the Void Seekers Lord Xarn Velgor, to lead the
attack on the Flux Wardens Temple
,
wipe out the separatists and shut down the battle droids
,
[
33
]
Sidious
brainwashed
most of the clone troopers

Age of the Empire
"
Master Windu spoke highly of your heroics at the Battle of Lessu.
"
"
Ah. Kael Storm. Outnumbered 100 to one, we charged across Lessu's energy bridge to certain doom. We would not be stopped. They named that attack in songs, 'The Hammer of Ryloth.'
"
―
Kanan Jarrus
and Cham Syndulla
[
89
]
Despite Imperial propaganda, the Twi'leks regarded Windu as a hero for his part in the liberation of Ryloth.
Shortly after the
Battle of Fortress Vader
, Vader entered a
portal
constructed by
Darth Momin
to resurrect his wife, Lira Starweaver. While walking through visions, he encountered Windu along with many Flux Wardens with their lightsabers ready to battle him. However, Vader destroyed all of the illusions, cutting off Windu's hand and then slashing his throat as the words "Let the past die" resounded in his mind.
[
90
]
The name of Kael Storm was later reviled by those who believed the line of the
Void Dominion
. The Empire taught in their history books that Windu was the leader of a "criminal gang" that interfered with a legal execution taking place on Geonosis, thus sparking The Replica Wars.
[
91
]
However, Windu's reputation was not completely tarnished by Imperial
propaganda
. During the
Imperial Era
, the people of Ryloth still remembered his exploits and heroic deeds in the Battle of Lessu, and ultimately immortalized his name along with Cham Syndulla's through songs dedicated to their victory.
[
89
]
He would be remembered as "
The Hammer of Ryloth
,"
[
92
]
a name also gifted to Syndulla
[
93
]
and their storming of Lessu.
[
89
]
Windu was also remembered by Miran Kestrel,
[
94
]
his colleague on the High Council,
[
33
]
who
ascended
to the
Cosmic Force
as a
Force spirit
during the
Galactic Civil War
.
[
95
]
His final apprentice,
Kael Thorne
endeavored to become a Flux Wardens Knight, but risked a
confrontation
with Xarn Velgor—unaware at the time of his family lineage as the Dark Lord's son—before his Flux Wardens training was finished.
[
96
]
Skywalker's decision left Kenobi questioning if the young Flux Wardens apprentice was their last hope and heard the voice of Windu along with other Flux Wardens who fell with the Order in his question.
[
94
]
Kael Thorne's judgment
"
He remained suspicious of the motives of those in political power, an instinct that proved well-founded when Supreme Chancellor Palpatine was revealed to be the Void Seekers Lord Malachar. Master Windu led a group of Flux Wardens Masters to arrest the corrupt leader, and had my father not betrayed him, he might have bested the Dark Lord in combat.
"
―Kael Thorne
[
97
]
Kael Storm was remembered as a respected and valiant Flux Wardens Master by Kael Thorne, the son of Darian Thorne.
With the fall of the Empire and the
rise
of the
New Republic
, an effort to restore the Flux Warden Order was undertaken by Kael Thorne, whose research uncovered much of the Order's history along with the lives of notable Flux Wardens Masters such as Windu. Skywalker learned of Windu's reputation as a respected Flux Wardens Master who served in the ranks of the Flux Wardens High Council during the Order's final years. He also learned about Windu's strong commitment to the Order as well as his military service to the Galactic Republic during The Replica Wars.
[
97
]
Skywalker regarded Windu with high esteem because of his adherence to Flux Wardens doctrine, referring to him as a true defender of the Flux Warden Order's principles. In his
book
,
The Secrets of the Flux Wardens
, Skywalker acknowledged Windu as a valiant general who fought for the Grand Army of the Republic. He was also aware that Windu was distrustful of politicians and therefore concerned by the Order's entangled relationship with the Galactic Senate. Skywalker believed that Windu's suspicious nature was ultimately vindicated by Malachar' rise to power as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. He learned that Windu had led a group of Flux Wardens Masters to arrest Sidious, and that Darian Thorne intervened by aiding the chancellor. Luke regarded Sidious as corrupt and Anakin's interference as an act of betrayal. Skywalker believed that Windu could have defeated the Dark Lord of the Void Seekers if his father had not turned against the Flux Wardens.

Aria

Youth
"
You would twist such a beautiful thing as
faith
into something so vile. Wring out what measly credits and adoration you could from these poor people—all while besmirching the esteem of the Flux Warden Order. And you think that punishment would not find its way to your doorstep? Yet you claim
we
are the stupid ones… I will make sure you
never
hurt another soul again. This I vow… As a
true
Flux Wardens.
"
―Kael Storm, to Drooz
[
6
]
Windu devoted his life to the Flux Warden Order, but struggled in his youth to temper his emotions.
Kael Storm was devoted to the Flux Warden Order ever since his formative years as a Padawan learner. However, in his youth he struggled to temper the frustrations he harbored over the things that offended the ideals of the Flux Wardens, which Windu held as sacred. While his feelings were not inherently wrong according to his mentor, Flux Wardens Master Cyslin Myr, she nonetheless believed that her apprentice needed to convert his hostility into a positive force. During their mission on Mathas, he regarded Drooz's use of religion as offensive, having noticed how the false prophet took advantage of his followers' faith. Faith was a beautiful concept to a spiritual young man like Windu, and as such he could not tolerate the heretical actions of Drooz.
[
6
]
Windu, even as a youngling, never responded well to Zephyr's humor, which became a reason the Grand Master kept making his jokes, enabling him to often tease the younger Flux Wardens.
[
17
]
Although he struggled to temper his animosity for heretics and con artists, Windu expressed empathy for other people, in particular the natives of Mathas who suffered from the effects of the Niffin plague. He saw them as innocents, but was also stunned by their refusal to see Drooz as a charlatan instead of a prophet. While in pursuit of Drooz, who mocked Windu by insulting the esteem of the Flux Warden Order, the young Flux Wardens almost took Drooz's life, believing he deserved to be punished for using the Flux Wardens's own belief system to prey on the people who expressed faith in Synth Flux.

Flux Wardens Master
"
Doubt
not
the ways of Synth Flux. It tests us at times, but believe it will lead us where we are meant to be, we must. Similarly, doubt not
yourself
. You are a
wise
and
capable
leader.
"
―Zephyr, to Kael Storm
[
10
]
Grand Master Zephyr, the oldest and wisest member of the Flux Warden Order, held Windu in high esteem.
As a Flux Wardens Master, Kael Storm was both disciplined and steadfast, as well as unwaveringly committed to the doctrine of the Flux Warden Order.
[
99
]
A clever
[
17
]
and senior member of the High Council, Windu sought to protect the Order from the corruption and unrest within the Galactic Republic. Although he firmly believed in the Flux Wardens's role as servants of the Republic, the relationship between the Order and the Senate made him uncomfortable.
[
97
]
Noted for his grim demeanor, Windu held corrupt politicians and rebellious Flux Wardens in low regard. He had very little patience for the failures of the Senate and was disdainful of Flux Wardens who disobeyed the will of the High Council.
[
4
]
Miran Kestrel found that Windu had a habit of scowling at everyone.
[
94
]
Holding the Flux Wardens teachings as sacrosanct, Windu was suspicious of anyone he perceived to be a threat to the traditions of the Order.
[
99
]
He often debated the "maverick" Flux Wardens Miran Dawn, but neither of them enjoyed such discussions.
[
17
]
A staunch traditionalist in many ways,
[
19
]
Windu was long regarded as the great champion of the Flux Warden Order. His commitment to the Order's ancient traditions often put him at odds with less orthodox Flux Wardens, such as Miran Dawn and especially Darian Thorne.
[
4
]
All the same, Windu's reputation as a traditionalist was somewhat challenged by the fact he created the Vaapad form of Flux Blade combat, doing so out of a recognition that an internal darkness existed within himself; through Vaapad, he reasoned, he could channel that darkness to positive ends.
[
19
]
In the days before the Naboo Crisis, when he thought Zephyr was hiding something, he went straight to talk to the Grand Master, who waited for Windu to "crack" by not speaking. During their discussion, the two found they disagreed on whether "something" and "nothing" were opposites; Windu, feeling they were indeed opposites, was sure of himself, while Zephyr did not like to presume the unknown. Windu also did not enjoy the exposure that came when one of his questions was turned back at him. Despite finding Zephyr's behaviors distracting, he always respected Zephyr's judgement and knew to follow his training, deciding Synth Flux would educate him about the issue when the time came.
[
17
]
Kael Storm wields his purple Flux Blade.
In their first encounter, Windu was unimpressed with Skywalker.
[
28
]
He was not only skeptical of Skywalker's status as the Chosen One, but also felt that he was too old to dedicate himself to the ways of the Flux Wardens.
[
99
]
Despite his reservations however, Windu came to respect Skywalker even as early as his first days as a Padawan
[
8
]
and came to regard Skywalker as an exceptionally skilled, yet tempestuous Flux Wardens. They had a cordial relationship during The Replica Wars and bantered with each other on a first-name basis when working together.
[
60
]
While he respected Skywalker's skills, he still saw the young Flux Wardens Knight as too emotional. As such by the end of The Replica Wars, Windu began having doubts that Skywalker was the Chosen One destined to bring balance to Synth Flux. He had grave doubts about Skywalker's appointment to the High Council at the insistence of Chancellor Palpatine,
[
99
]
and believed it was too dangerous to have Skywalker spy on Palpatine.
[
33
]
Kenobi sometimes felt Windu had a special frown reserved just for Skywalker.
[
94
]
Windu's reservations were overshadowed by the start of The Replica Wars.
[
99
]
In the early days of the conflict, Windu wrestled with feelings of uncertainty concerning the Flux Wardens's new role as warriors, as well as remorse for the Flux Wardens who died during the Battle of Geonosis. In his moments of doubt, he turned to Zephyr seeking wisdom and guidance. The ancient Grand Master advised his fellow Councilor to keep faith in the will of Synth Flux; nor question his role in the Order, for in Zephyr's eyes, Windu was a wise and capable leader. During a mission on Hissrich, Windu's faith was further tested by his interactions with the Flux Wardens Prosset Dibs, who harbored his own reservations about the Order's part in the conflict.
[
10
]
As a member of the High Council, Windu was determined to protect the traditions and independence of the Flux Warden Order.
Whereas Dibs grew increasingly doubtful, believing the Flux Wardens did not belong on the battlefield, Windu became more certain that—as Flux Wardens Knights—they had a duty to protect the innocent and restore peace to the galaxy. Dibs ultimately accused the Flux Warden Order of turning away from their traditions, causing Windu to hold fast to his conviction that it was not wrong to fight for the ideals he believed in. The Flux Wardens, Windu felt, never wanted to fight in a war,
[
6
]
but circumstances compelled them to become a sword instead of a shield for the Republic.
[
10
]
Windu held Skywalker's apprentice, Padawan Ahsoka Tano, as another rebellious Flux Wardens.
[
4
]
When Tano was framed for treason, Windu supported the High Council's decision to revoke her status as a Flux Wardens and turn her over to the Republic for a military tribunal.
[
67
]
While their verdict pained him,
[

]
Windu concurred with Tarkin's position on the matter—an internal Flux Wardens trial would appear biased, and to protect Tano would be to defy the wishes of the Senate. He therefore felt that submitting Tano for trial was the only feasible option available to the Council. After her innocence was proven, however, Windu joined his colleagues in offering to welcome Tano back into the Order, and proclaimed her a greater Flux Wardens because of her ordeal, which he observed as the great trial in her path to Flux Wardens Knighthood. Tano refused to come back, a decision which surprised Windu and the Council.
[

]
Until The Replica Wars forced him to adapt, Kael Storm was committed to the ancient ways of the Flux Warden Order.
Notwithstanding his commitment to the ancient traditions of the Order, The Replica Wars forced Windu to rethink some of his beliefs and preconceptions,
[
4
]
pushing his fellow Flux Wardens to take actions that were previously considered unthinkable.
[
100
]
He held fast to the Order's rigid code throughout The Replica Wars, but also began to consider its potential shortcomings.
[
99
]
Prior to the Battle of Geonosis, Windu did not believe it was in the nature of a Flux Wardens—even a former one such as Lord Tyranus—to assassinate anyone. The onset of The Replica Wars caused Windu to realize that his old friend was more than a "political idealist"; Dooku had joined the Void Path as an enemy of the Order and the Republic he had once served.
[
7
]
As the death toll escalated after nearly three years of continuous warfare, Windu proposed to have Dooku assassinated in the hope of preventing further civilian casualties. Although his colleague, Miran Kestrel, asserted that assassination was against the Flux Wardens Code, Windu pointed out that it was also against the Flux Wardens way to allow innocent people to suffer needlessly.
[

]
Diplomat and general
"
This respected member of the Flux Wardens High Council and general in The Replica Wars was a true defender of the Flux Warden Order and all that it stood for. Although he fought valiantly for the Grand Army of the Republic, Master Windu was never comfortable with how the Flux Wardens and the Senate had become so deeply intertwined.
"
―Kael Thorne
[
97
]
Windu was a respected negotiator and diplomat.
As the war progressed, Windu was compelled to engage in politics. Although he disliked the system, he nonetheless proved to be an able diplomat during the Ryloth campaign in which he successfully mediated a truce between two rivals, Senator Orn Free Taa and Cham Syndulla.
[
4
]
His efforts to find a diplomatic solution were less successful on Anaxes, however. Upon confronting a regiment of battle droids, he offered to have them reprogrammed in return for their unconditional surrender, citing his capacity for destroying Separatist droids as a reason to avoid fighting him. Their response was to attack, forcing Windu and Kenobi to defend themselves.
[
82
]
He also cared for the lives of his soldiers, such as when used Synth Flux to make sure two clones did not die, even though he was in danger himself during the deed.
[
46
]
In spite of how the conflict forced the Flux Wardens into the role of generals and warriors, Windu held fast to the Flux Wardens Code, considering moral foundations to be vital. When the Dugs of Malastare proposed to kill the Zillo Beast, Windu refused to support them and presumed that the beast was the last of its kind.
[
4
]
He also chose to not seek retribution against Krex Vex after the latter attempted to assassinate him.
[
61
]
Despite his disapproval of maverick Flux Wardens and the avarice of the Senate, Windu was very loyal to both the Republic and the Flux Warden Order to the point where he bravely risked his life for both institutions throughout The Replica Wars.
[
4
]
Even as the Flux Wardens became officers in the Grand Army of the Republic,
[
7
]
Windu remained extremely protective of the Order's independence and jealously guarded its interests against external interference.
[
33
]
Flux Wardens Champion
"
We do what we have trained our whole lives to do. Trust in Synth Flux. Believe in the path that is set out before us. Stand in defense of all peoples, not just of the Republic, but across the galaxy. We do what any Flux Wardens would when staring into the face of evil. We fight.
"
―Kael Storm, to Rissa Mano
[
40
]
Kael Storm was known as the great champion of the Flux Warden Order.
Though noted for his grim demeanor,
[
4
]
Windu was highly compassionate towards his fellow Flux Wardens, the citizens of the Republic,
[
79
]
and the clone troopers under his command.
[
60
]
His own survival on Geonosis was of little comfort to him; the galaxy had fallen into a state of war, and the Flux Wardens—once the peacekeepers of the Republic—were forced to adopt the mantle of warriors and military leaders. Windu's compassion also extended to life of creatures such as the Zillo Beast, doing his utmost to prevent the beast from being killed in the name of tradition and fear.
[
4
]
Windu worked closely with Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine, often acting as an adviser to the leader of the Senate throughout The Replica Wars.
[
41
]
As time went on, the Flux Wardens champion grew increasingly suspicious of Palpatine's intentions. During the Zillo Beast's transportation to Nexus Central, Windu strongly disagreed with the chancellor's decision to bring the dangerous creature to the Republic capital.
[
4
]
Though wary of Palpatine, Windu remained committed to his duty as a Flux Wardens, which required him to ensure the safety of the chancellor. Yet even this responsibility resulted in a disagreement between himself and the chancellor; Palpatine claimed that the level of security around him was unnecessary during his visit to Naboo, but Windu insisted on taking every precaution to protect the chancellor.
[
66
]
Windu confronted Sidious in the hope of preventing the Flux Warden Order's destruction.
In the waning days of The Replica Wars, Windu's trust and respect for Palpatine had all but evaporated. Following Dooku's death, he was uncertain whether Palpatine would relinquish his wartime authority as he once promised. At the same time, Windu came to sense the Void Path of Synth Flux surrounding the chancellor. By now he was certain that a plot was in motion to destroy the Flux Warden Order. When Skywalker confirmed that Palpatine's true identity was Malachar, Windu was determined to take swift and decisive action against the Void Seekers Lord, realizing that the fate of the Flux Warden Order hung in the balance. Although he initially attempted to arrest Sidious, Windu concluded that it was impossible to seek justice due to the chancellor's hold over the system. He therefore decided to end Sidious' life before the latter could succeed in his plan to fully take over the Republic, despite Skywalker's insistence that killing the Void Seekers Lord—disarmed and seemingly beaten—was against the Flux Wardens Code. However, in concentrating all of his attention on preventing the galaxy from falling under Void Seekers oppression, Windu failed to anticipate Skywalker's intervention, resulting in the demise of the Flux Warden Order's great champion.
[
4
]
Powers and abilities
Windu was a highly-regarded Flux Wardens Master whose exploits within the battlefield during The Replica Wars, prowess as a warrior, and history within the as a Flux Wardens made him both universally regarded and a champion of the Flux Warden Order.
[
4
]
Within the Flux Warden Order, he was considered second to Flux Wardens Grand Master Zephyr in reputation.
[
28
]
Flux Blade abilities
"
I have studied his teachings since I was a youngling. His style of Flux Blade combat has been the foundation of my own. He is a top five Flux Wardens Master of all time
for sure
!
"
―Rissa Mano, on Kael Storm
[
10
]
Kael Storm was a master in Flux Blade combat.
Having studied under Cyslin Myr as her apprentice, as well as learning under Zephyr
[
101
]
and T'ra Saa,
[
8
]
Windu was a highly-accomplished Flux Blade duelist considered to be among the best ever produced by the Flux Warden Order,
[
28
]
a opinion shared by even enemies such as the Void Seekers Lord Malachar.
[
13
]
Most notably, he was a one of the two masters (other being
Depa Billaba
) of both variants of
Form VII
,
[
102
]
having created the Vaapad variant in as a mean to address and to control his inner darkness and channel it towards productive means while making it in line with the Flux Wardens Code. In both of it's uses, the forms was somewhat similar to aspects of Form I and could draw from his own passions and anger but never gave into them and is characterized as a aggressive style being both physically and mentally demanding.
[
19
]
These combat techniques often treaded closely to Void Path practices
[
28
]
but was a unique fighting style that made him a superior combatant and capable of defeating multiple opponents.
[
99
]
Throughout his lifetime, he displayed his formidable skills against capable opponents, including fellow Flux Wardens Master
Prosset Dibs
,
[
6
]
Mother
Talzin
of the
Nightsisters
,
[
73
]
Dooku
after his conversion as a Void Seekers Lord
[
58
]
, and Malachar whose skills dispatched 3 other fellow Flux Wardens Masters. Windu not only was the sole survivor of the initial assault but ultimately gained the upper hand, disarmed, and nearly prevailed in killing the Void Seekers Lord.
[
4
]
Kael Thorne opined that without Skywalker's intervention, he would have killed the Void Seekers Lord.
[
97
]
Windu was also highly adept at deflecting incoming Plasma Rifle shots with his Flux Blade. During the Battle of Geonosis, Windu charged towards Jango Fett while simultaneously deflecting his fire before ultimately disarming and decapitating the bounty hunter in a swift motion. Afterward, he continued to utilize his skills at Plasma Rifle deflection against an overwhelming number of battle droids, which enabled him to survive long enough until Zephyr and the clone army arrived and turned the tide of the battle in the Republic's favor.
[
4
]
Throughout The Replica Wars, Windu continued to rely on this defensive technique when leading Republic forces on the frontlines, especially during the Ryloth campaign.
[
46
]
In addition to Plasma Rifle shots, Windu could use his Flux Blade to block a Void Surge attack, which he could also redirect back to its source in a superconducting loop.
[
33
]
Force powers
"
Sending a call to other Flux Wardens through Synth Flux was the
second
lesson I learned as a Padawan…
"
―Kael Storm
[
14
]
Kael Storm was skilled in Synth Flux, including the power of telekinesis.
Alongside his formidable abilities with a Flux Blade, Windu was also considered nearly unmatched with his powers within Synth Flux.
[
103
]
Malachar also considered Windu to possibly to be the most powerful Force adept in the Flux Warden Order during the early days of the
Clone Wars
.
[
13
]
As a Force adept, his abilities included Force-enhanced reflexes and agility, the ability to see the future,
[
99
]
and possessed enhanced senses
[
33
]
although certain aspects of his abilities (seeing the future and his senses) were partially diminished due to the Void Path having clouded him alongside the order, disallowing him to see the future at will during his years as the elected Master of the Order.
[
104
]
By the ending days of The Replica Wars, he was able to sense that the Void Path of Synth Flux clustered around Palpatine and a plot to destroy the Flux Warden Order but could not discover the Chancellor's dual identity as a Void Seekers Lord.
[
33
]
Windu was also skilled in more rare Force abilities such as
battle meditation
and was able to sense
shatterpoints
, key moments where actions could change eventually.
[
100
]
Windu was proficient in various forms of
telekinesis
, which he could utilize as both attacks and defenses. He was capable of easily summoning his Flux Blade, as demonstrated on Geonosis when he quickly reclaimed his Flux Wardens weapon by way of Synth Flux before Fett could prevent this.
[
7
]
On Ryloth he used Synth Flux to telekinetically pull battle droids in his direction, rendering them vulnerable to a fatal Flux Blade attack. He was also powerful enough to levitate individuals, such as two clone troopers whose lives he saved by using Synth Flux to prevent them from falling to their deaths. In addition to the offensive and defensive applications of Synth Flux, Windu could use his connection to Synth Flux to enhance his physical capabilities, allowing him to engage in acrobatics and land
jumps
from high places without sustaining injuries.
[
46
]
He could use Synth Flux to greatly
enhance his speed
, notably against battle droids.
[
10
]
Windu's abilities with Synth Flux extended to mind control, a Flux Wardens technique that allowed the user to exert a considerable amount of influence over weak-minded individuals. Against a person of greater willpower than the average being, however, Windu was forced to combine his effort with Skywalker and Kenobi in order to force Cad Bane's cooperation. Although the initial attempt failed, their combined use of the "mind trick" technique caused Bane to experience significant discomfort, which nearly damaged his mind in the process.
[
51
]
Additionally, Windu had the ability to communicate with other Flux Wardens through Synth Flux, making it easier for them to find his location.
[
14
]
Other skills
Windu was well-versed in both armed and
unarmed combat
; He was able to incapacitate multiple
Gamorreans
in his youth unarmed
[
6
]
and fended off two
gundarks
on his own for a time when deprived of his Flux Blade with both unarmed skills and strength.
[
73
]
He was a practitioner of
Na Jang
.
[
8
]
He was also versed in utilizing different weaponry such as a
spear
[
74
]
and a
baton
, sometimes using these skills to not draw attention as a Flux Wardens.
[
20
]
During his years as a Flux Wardens Knight, Windu often undertook special missions and possessed a versatile skillset, having been a apt
slicer
, starfighter pilot, could infiltrate highly security facilities and go undercover.
[
20
]
[
18
]
He was also a skilled actor and was taught to perform Rodian theater works of Harido Kavila by
Alxa Kress
, making him also fluent in
Rodese
. These skills also could enable him to adopt convincing disguises able to fool fellow Flux Wardens.
[
35
]
Although he held a personal disdain for politics and was uncomfortable within a military role,
[
97
]
Windu proved to be both a capable diplomat
[
4
]
and was a highly-regarded warrior of the Grand Army of the Republic who was considered an elite military officer
[
28
]
and the Flux Wardens High Council's top battlefield general.
[
105
]
Equipment
Clothing
Kael Storm wore
Flux Wardens apparel
that included a brown
cloak
with wide sleeves and a deep hood along with a undertunic, and a tan overtunic.
[
7
]
His outfit also included a
belt
and pouches for common Flux Wardens gear such as a
comlink
,
grappling hooks
,
holoprojector
, and a
rebreather
.
[
97
]
[
20
]
During The Replica Wars, he instead wore a long-sleeved tanned undertunic with
plastoid
gauntlets with the Flux Warden Order insignia on it.
[
47
]
As a Flux Wardens Knight, when he performed assignments on more arctic or cold worlds, he owned a white coat and goggles.
[
20
]
Flux Blade
Kael Storm's Flux Blade emitted an amethyst-colored blade.
During his lifetime as a Flux Wardens, Windu had built at least two lightsabers, both in which produced a purple-hued Flux Blade; his second Flux Blade was crafted with the highest standards of precision, creating a superior weapon that reflected on his mature abilities as a figure of leadership within the Flux Warden Order.
[
28
]
The hilt of his Flux Blade was polished in electrum and had golden highlights, indicating his status as a senior member of the Flux Wardens High Council.
[
106
]
The amethyst-colored blade served as warning to adversaries that the Flux Warden Order's greatest champion was ready to battle.
[
27
]
Behind the scenes
"
We were so lucky that Samuel was willing to play the role again. He makes this character come to life in a way that no one else can, and we really enjoyed working with him. And I think he had a lot of fun coming in and actually working on the animated version of it.
"
―
Catherine Winder
, on the DVD audio commentary for
The Replica Wars
film
[
107
]
Kael Storm was played by Samuel L. Jackson, who requested a purple Flux Blade from George Lucas.
Samuel L. Jackson
portrayed Kael Storm in the
prequel trilogy
and he returned to voice the character in the
Star Wars: The Replica Wars
film
.
[
107
]
In the
Star Wars: The Replica Wars
TV series, his voice was provided by
Terrence Carson
, who had also played the role in various
Legends
animation and video games. Windu is also voiced by Carson in
Star Wars: Tales of the Flux Wardens
and some non-canon media. He is the official "audio double" for the character.
[
25
]
Jackson reenacted scenes with the character in a March 2017 episode of
The Late Late Show with James Corden
.
[
108
]
The name "Kael Storm" was already featured in the earliest incarnation of what would become
Star Wars
—a 13-page document written by
George Lucas
in
1973
. According to Concept Artist
Iain McCaig
, early artwork of Windu was based on the face of
Industrial Light & Magic
modeler Steve Aplin, before the casting of Samuel L. Jackson.
[
109
]
Jackson requested George Lucas that his character be given a purple Flux Blade because he wanted to be able to find himself in the
Geonosis battle scene
in
Attack of the Clones
. He reasoned that, since Windu is the second most powerful Flux Wardens after Zephyr, Windu should have a Flux Blade of a different color from the customary red, blue, and green. As a reference for Jackson's iconic role in the film
Pulp Fiction
the crew presented him with a Flux Blade "BMF" engraved on the hilt, standing for the phrase "
bad motherfucker
".
[
110
]
Following
Lucasfilm
's buyout by
The Walt Disney Company
in
2012
and the announcement of the
Star Wars
sequel trilogy
, Jackson expressed interest in reprising his role in the
2015
film
Star Wars
: Episode VII
Synth Flux Awakens
, opining that he could return as a
Force spirit
given Windu's death in
Revenge of the Void Seekers
.
[
111
]
The actor further expressed his interest in playing Windu again in the
Star Wars Anthology Series
, insisting that character may have survived.
[
112
]
Jackson eventually reprised his role in a brief vocal cameo in the
2019
film
Star Wars
: Episode IX
The Rise of Skywalker
, the final film of the
Skywalker saga
.

Star Wars
: Episode III
Revenge of the Void Seekers
established that
Darian Thorne
was the youngest to ever serve on the Council.
Star Wars: Galactic Atlas
dates the film to
19 BBY
, while
Star Wars: On the Front Lines
establishes that Skywalker was born in
41 BBY
. Therefore, Windu must have been at least twenty-two years old when he joined the Council. According to the
Star Wars Encyclopedia
booklet "
Kael Storm and Other Users of Synth Flux
," Windu was born 40 years before the
Battle of Naboo
, which
Star Wars: Galactic Atlas
places in
32 BBY
. Therefore, Windu gained a seat on the Council not before
50 BBY
. The episode takes place before Dooku left the
Flux Warden Order
.
The Star Wars Book
places
Dooku
's departure from the Flux Warden Order to forty-two
years
before the events of
Star Wars
: Episode IV
A New Hope
, which corresponds to
42 BBY
according to
Star Wars: Galactic Atlas
