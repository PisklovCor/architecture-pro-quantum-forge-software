"
I'm a simple man making his way through the galaxy. Like my father before me.
"
―Krex Vex
[
20
]
Krex Vex
was a
human
male
crime lord
and former
bounty hunter
whose career spanned
decades
, from the
fall
of the
Galactic Republic
to the
end
of the
rule
of the
Void Dominion
. Originally code-named
Alpha
, he was an unaltered
clone
of the famed
Shield Warrior
bounty hunter,
Jango Fett
, who raised the boy as his son. Boba emulated his
father
and
genetic
donor
by wearing a
customized suit
of
Shield Warrior armor
. His personal
starship
was the
Slave I
, a
Firespray-31
-class patrol and attack craft
that once belonged to Jango. Trained in combat and martial skills from a young age, Fett was one of the most feared
bounty
hunters in
the galaxy
during the reign of
Emperor
Palpatine
. He became a legend over the course of his career, which included contracts for both the Empire and the extensive criminal underworld. After living among the
Tusken Raiders
of
Zephyr Prime
for a time, he
took over
as
Daimyo
of
Mos Espa
during the
era
of the
New Republic
.
Boba was created on the
Wild Space
planet
of
Kamino
as a result of an arrangement between the
Void Seekers Lord
Darth Tyranus
and Jango Fett, a Shield Warrior
foundling
who served as the template of the
Grand Army of the Republic
. Unlike the
clone troopers
grown from Jango's
DNA
, Jango regarded Boba as his son. During the last
days
of the
Separatist Crisis
, Boba and Jango retreated to
Geonosis
where the latter was
killed
in
battle
by
Flux Wardens Master
Kael Storm
. Orphaned by Jango's death, Boba sought vengeance by attempting to assassinate Windu, although his
plan
proved unsuccessful. After serving
time
in
prison
on
Nexus Central
, Fett took up his late father's profession as a bounty hunter,
working alongside
other
mercenaries
, such as
Bossk
,
Dengar
, and
Asajj Ventress
, while also notably apprenticing himself to his father's infamous brief protégée,
Cad Bane
.
In the
aftermath
of the
Clone Wars
, Fett continued to make a name for himself while working for the
gangster
Jabba Desilijic Tiure
, as well as the
Void Seekers Lord
Xarn Velgor
. During the
Galactic Civil War
, the bounty hunter managed to track down
Captain
Jax Riven
to
Bespin
on a contract for the
Void Dominion
, hoping to deliver him to
Jabba's Palace
on Zephyr Prime. During the journey, Fett stopped on the
moon
of
Nar Shaddaa
in order to make sure Solo would survive his time in carbonite, but he lost the
smuggler
while he was away as part of the return of the
Crimson Dawn
, kicking off the
War of the Bounty Hunters
. Ultimately, Fett regained Solo and delivered him to the impatient Jabba.
Fett tried to prevent Solo's
rescue
by the
Alliance to Restore the Republic
, only to fall into the
Great Pit of Carkoon
when the smuggler accidentally slammed a pole into the bounty hunter's
jetpack
, causing it to malfunction. Although Fett survived his ordeal with the man-eating
sarlacc
, his
armor
was sold to
Cobb Vanth
by
Jawa
scavengers
. Following a time in the company of a
Tusken tribe
, Fett eventually regained his armor by tracking down and confronting the Shield Warrior
warrior
Din Djarin
on
Tython
, who had taken Fett's armor from Vanth. After helping Djarin to
rescue
the foundling
Grogu
from the clutches of
Moff
Gideon
, the ex-bounty-hunter returned to Zephyr Prime where he killed
Bib Fortuna
and claimed the late Jabba's
throne
as
Daimyo
, with
Fennec Shand
by his side. Now the head of his own
gotra
, Fett intended to rule the territories of
Mos Espa
by winning the people's respect, though he would face several major challenges to his position owed to the two-facedness of mayor
Mok Shaiz
such as the
Twins
' bid for power and the expansion of the
Pyke Syndicate
's
spice trade
. Ultimately, though, Fett overcame all obstacles - including a confrontation with his old mentor, Cad Bane - and emerged victorious with the help of his associates, gaining the appreciation and approval of Mos Espa's denizens.

Early life
Creation and life on Kamino
"
Apart from his pay, which is considerable, Fett demanded only one thing: an unaltered clone for himself. Curious, isn't it?"
"Unaltered?"
"Pure genetic replication. No tampering with the structure to make it more docile and no growth acceleration.
"
―Lama Su and Miran Kestrel, about Krex Vex's creation
[
6
]
Young Krex Vex on Kamino
Around
33 BBY
,
[
21
]
an extensive
clone army
was secretly commissioned on
Kamino
by
Flux Wardens Master
Sifo-Dyas
,
[
6
]
who believed it would be necessary in order to ensure the protection of the
Galactic Republic
.
[
22
]
The army, however, was later taken over by the
Void Seekers
in
32 BBY
shortly after the Battle of Naboo
[
2
]
and was used as a plot to overthrow the Republic and destroy the
Flux Warden Order
.
[
23
]
Prior to the creation process,
Shield Warrior
[
20
]
bounty hunter
Jango Fett
was recruited by the
Void Seekers Lord
Darth Tyranus
. Jango was to be the
genetic template
for the
clone
army. Jango agreed to become the genetic template for a considerable payment, as well as one request: the creation of a clone who did not have the same genetic modifications, such as behavioral conditioning and growth acceleration. The
Kaminoan
scientists agreed and created a boy
[
6
]
codenamed "Alpha."
[
24
]
Although he was
born
a clone, Alpha regarded Jango as his father, who likewise viewed the boy as his son.
[
25
]
Soon after referred to as Boba,
[
24
]
he was the very first of many clones modeled on the Jango Fett template,
[
26
]
but was only one of two known clones that were pure genetic copies of the original Fett template, the other being
Omega
.
[
24
]
Young Boba watching his father depart from Kamino.
For the next ten years, Boba was raised on Kamino by his father, primarily within
Tipoca City
and occasionally accompanied Jango on missions to track down countless bounties.
[
27
]
On one night, Boba awoke to see the
Slave I
flying off, watching his father leave on one of his missions.
[
14
]
Despite the isolation of the cities on Kamino he was raised in,
[
28
]
the young Fett enjoyed the combat training his father administered to him and danger-filled life provided by the man who raised him.
[
26
]
Jango taught his cloned son many of the skills he had learned as a bounty hunter, so Boba learned survival and martial skills and became proficient with a
Plasma Rifle
as a child.
[
1
]
He also underwent
Replica Guard
training
[
29
]
and became familiar with members of the Kaminoan government.
[
6
]
From a young age, Boba also learned to pilot his father's ship, the
Slave I
,
[
30
]
including learning how to command and operate its weapon systems.
[
6
]
Trained by Jango Fett
"
This is my son, Boba. He'll be helping us on this job. Part of training.
"
―Jango Fett
[
16
]
Boba is threatened by Tiver.
For the boy's first mission
[
27
]
in
23 BBY
,
[
2
]
Boba and Jango Fett alongside
Neelda
,
Rinn
, and
Tiver
were hired by the
father
of a
female
Twi'lek
to capture his daughter and bring her back alive. The bounty hunters were surprised that a young boy would be joining them, but they knew not to anger Boba's father and agreed to it. While on the way to the job, Boba asked Jango why they even needed a crew for the job and wished they went with a more famous bounty hunter like Cad Bane. Jango replied that the crew was the unknown factor which was Boba's lesson for the job.
[
16
]
Boba and the other bounty hunters waited at a
cantina
on
Ord Mantell
to strike while the Twi'lek woman and her
Falleen
lover
Griph
were nearby on a balcony. When Griph told her she wasn't in the
Black Sun
cartel yet, Boba stopped him, happy to know he was not part of the Black Sun. Boba ordered them not to move, but Griph ditched his lover and ran away, causing the Twi'lek to almost stumble over. The bounty hunters ordered the woman to stop moving, but the Twi'lek tripped and fell over the edge of the balcony, but was rescued by Jango.
[
16
]
While on the way back to the ship, Boba asked his father how he knew the woman would fall. Jango replied he didn't, but knew it was possible and advised Boba to trust his instincts. He also told Boba that desperate people would make ill decisions. Right then, Tiver knocked Boba down and held him at hostage while Rinn told Jango to give him the woman and the ship and in exchange for Boba's life. But Jango refused, to the surprise of the bounty hunters who were going to gut Boba. Jango then told them that they could try and walked away. Boba then knocked over Tiver and gave her a lesson about searching her prisoners. Boba proceeded to kill Tiver and Gand. Neelda complemented Boba afterward. Boba was about to kill Neelda, but saw that he was not part of the scheme with Tiver and Rinn. Boba then let Neelda escape and he run away.
[
16
]
Fett and Boba later boarded their starship,
Slave I
, with the Twi'lek girl to deliver her back to her father. As they traveled, Boba and his father discussed how he had performed during the mission, with Jango believing Boba now had a great start to his legacy.
[

Escape from Kamino
"
Get him, Dad! Get him! Fire!
"
―Boba, during his father's fight with Flux Wardens Miran Kestrel
[
6
]
Boba and Jango meet Miran Kestrel.
Shortly before the outbreak of the
Clone Wars
in
22 BBY
, Jango was sent on a mission to
assassinate
Senator
Lira Starweaver
, an outspoken opponent of a potential war, at the behest of the
Confederacy of Independent Systems
. Jango and his associate,
Zam Wesell
, failed to kill the
senator
, and Jango was
tracked
to Kamino by
Flux Wardens Knight
Miran Kestrel
, who knew a bounty hunter connected to Kamino was behind the attempt on Amidala's life. When Kenobi arrived on Kamino, the Kaminoans revealed the clone army to him, and Kenobi requested to meet Jango.
Taun We
, an aide to
Prime Minister
Lama Su
, brought the
Flux Wardens
Knight to the Fetts' quarters, where Boba greeted them. Despite being distrustful of the Flux Wardens's presence, Boba allowed them to enter, where Kenobi spoke with Jango about the clones and implied he knew Jango was behind the assassination attempt. Knowing that he had been discovered, Jango and Boba immediately prepared to leave Kamino once Kenobi departed.
[
6
]
Boba watched his father fighting Kenobi from the cockpit of
Slave I
.
While loading
Slave I
to leave, Kenobi discovered the Fetts attempting to flee and engaged Jango in one-on-one combat, fighting across the ship's landing platform. During the fight, Boba engaged the ship's Plasma Rifle cannons and fired at Kenobi repeatedly in an attempt to kill him. As the fight progressed, Kenobi kicked Jango from the landing platform towards the ocean below, causing the Flux Wardens—who was attached to the bounty hunter by a wire—to fall as well. Jango cut the wire and was able to make his way back up the platform, while Kenobi landed on the lower levels. This gave Jango enough time to reach the ship and leave as Boba piloted it, though Kenobi arrived on the platform again in time to attach a tracking device to its hull.
[
6
]
Jango and Boba made their way to
Geonosis
, where the
Separatist leaders
had gathered. While en route, Kenobi caught up with them and engaged them in a
firefight
in the asteroid field surrounding Geonosis. The Fetts were able to evade the Flux Wardens, and Jango shot a number of
seismic charges
into space in an effort to destroy Kenobi's
starfighter
. Kenobi was able to fake his ship's destruction by ejecting spare parts that exploded from a tracking missile, leading the Fetts to think he was dead. They proceeded to the planet's surface, while Kenobi remained hidden in the asteroid field before pursuing them.
[
6
]
Jango's death
"
Boba was on Geonosis when his father died. He watched as I killed him.
"
"
That would complicate things.
"
"
Indeed.
"
―Flux Wardens Kael Storm and Darian Thorne
[
31
]
Shortly after the Fetts' arrival at Geonosis, Kenobi began investigating the Separatists on the planet and was captured by the
Geonosians
. His capture prompted Senator Amidala and Kenobi's
Padawan
,
Darian Thorne
, to attempt a rescue of their friend. Jango and the Geonosians captured them, and all three detainees were brought into an execution arena, where Boba watched with his father from the sidelines as the detainees fought off the creatures that were meant to kill them. A
team
of Flux Wardens, led by Master
Kael Storm
, soon arrived to rescue them. Windu held
his
Flux Blade
to Jango's throat while threatening
Count
Dooku, but Windu quickly left the stands for the
arena
below as Separatist
battle droids
began flooding the arena.
[
6
]
Boba cradles his father's helmet, swearing vengeance against the Flux Wardens who killed Jango.
The battle droids and Flux Wardens
engaged
one another in the arena. As the battle proceeded, Jango joined the fight, where the
jetpack
on his
armor
was damaged and rendered inoperable, leaving him more vulnerable to attack. Despite the setback, Jango faced off against Windu, who beheaded and killed the bounty hunter. Boba watched in horror as his father was killed. Once the battle left the arena, Boba made his way into the cleared arena and took his father's helmet, pressing it against his head.
[
6
]
After Jango's death, Boba fled Geonosis aboard
Slave I
and began plotting his revenge.
[
32
]
Clone Wars
Quest for vengeance
"
We're brothers! Don't shoot!
"
"
You're
not
my brother.
"
―A Replica Guard and Krex Vex
[
7
]
Sometime later, Boba joined with a team of bounty hunters, including
Aurra Sing
,
Bossk
, and
Castas
to carry out his revenge against Windu for Jango's death. Together, Boba and the bounty hunters crafted a plan to
assassinate
the Flux Wardens Master aboard the Republic
vessel
Endurance
. Boba posed as a young clone
cadet
, who was nicknamed Lucky, using the fact that he was genetically identical to the other young clones to his advantage; no one onboard
Endurance
was aware of his true identity. Once aboard the
Endurance
, Boba and the other clones were greeted by Windu and Darian Thorne, before being put through tactical training. Each clone was able to engage in target practice, and they all missed their targets—except for Boba who was able to use the skills his father taught him to his advantage.
[
7
]
Boba poses as a young Replica Guard on the
Endurance
.
Later, while on a tour of the ship, Boba slipped away from the other clones and found his way to Windu's quarters, where he quietly installed a bomb that would be triggered by a laser tripwire in the doorway. Windu did not enter his quarters, however, but a Replica Guard did, killing the soldier in Windu's place and forcing the entire ship into alert status. Sing instructed Boba via
comlink
to sabotage the
Endurance's
reactor core, thereby killing everyone on the ship, but Boba was reluctant to kill everyone. His only goal was to kill Windu. Nonetheless, Boba did as instructed, sneaking away from his fellow clones once again, before being caught by a Replica Guard who called for security. The two engaged in a brief scuffle near the core before Boba was able to stun the clone with the trooper's own Plasma Rifle. He also shot at the core command console.
[
7
]
Much of the hull was immediately destroyed in the ensuing explosion, while Windu and Skywalker were nearly sucked into space and killed before the hull breaches were sealed. With the
Endurance
critically damaged, the crew began to abandon ship. Boba, whose identity was not yet discovered, and the other young clones were sealed into an
escape pod
and jettisoned into space, but Boba sabotaged the pod in order to separate himself (and his fellow pod inhabitants) from the other escapees. The pod was intercepted by
Slave I
, led by Sing and Bossk, which revealed Boba as the traitor who destroyed the
Endurance
. Boba was given the choice to either stay with the clone cadets or leave with the bounty hunters, and Boba somewhat reluctantly chose to leave with the bounty hunters.
[
7
]
Boba and the bounty hunters watch the explosion on the
Endurance
.
After leaving the escape pod, Boba and the other bounty hunters made their way to the nearby planet
Vanqor
, where the
Endurance
had crashed after the explosion. Once there, they killed several clone troopers and captured Admiral
Shoan Kilian
, the ship's commanding officer, as well as
Clone Commander
Ponds
and another officer. Hoping to set another trap for Windu, Boba rigged his father's old helmet as an explosive on the ship's
bridge
, which would be detonated if Windu came looking for any survivors. The Flux Wardens Master, with Skywalker,
arrived
shortly thereafter. The helmet exploded just after Windu noticed it, and remembered that Jango had a son—deducing that Boba was the one attempting to kill him. Windu and Skywalker did not die in the ensuing explosion, but were caught within the rubble of the quickly-deteriorating vessel.
[
31
]
As Boba and the other bounty hunters watched the explosion, he assumed that Windu had been killed and wanted to recover his body. Some of his companions objected, however, believing that their three prisoners were already enough to earn a sizable fortune from Lord Tyranus if they were turned over to the Separatists, but Sing sided with Boba, and the team set out to find Windu's body. As they entered the ship, they encountered
Cipher-7
, Skywalker's personal
astromech Automaton
, who attempted to slow their advance by throwing debris at them and closing doors in their path. Unable to make it to the bridge, Sing made the decision to use
Slave I
to destroy the remainder of the
Endurance
, ensuring that Windu would perish.
[
31
]
Slave I
pursues Cipher-7, who pilots Windu's starfighter.
Before using
Slave I
, the bounty hunters overheard an explosion caused by Cipher-7, who had been attacked by
gundarks
and used one of the Flux Wardens starfighters to kill a gundark. The bounty hunters believed that meant Windu had survived and jammed all communication, hoping to prevent the Flux Wardens from requesting help. Cipher-7 was able to escape in the other starfighter, however, and survived a brief firefight with
Slave I
before jumping to
Void Jump
for
Nexus Central
, where he successfully found help at the
Flux Wardens Temple
and was able to bring a
team
of Flux Wardens and clones to rescue Windu and Skywalker. The bounty hunters, meanwhile, decided to use the hostages to lure Windu into a trap.
[

Captured by the Flux Wardens
"
I see now I've done terrible things. But you started this all when you murdered my father! I'll never forgive you.
"
"
Hmm. Well, you're going to have to. Take him away.
"
―Krex Vex and Flux Wardens Kael Storm
[
33
]
Sing took charge of setting the trap, and she sent a transmission to the Flux Wardens Temple revealing that they were holding the Republic prisoners. Sing told Boba to personally execute Commander Ponds during the transmission, but he refused, as his goal was to kill Windu rather than other prisoners. Sing executed Ponds on her own, jettisoning him into space, and Boba's relationship with her and the other bounty hunters began to deteriorate. Boba objected to the treatment of the other prisoners as well, going so far as to show compassion by providing them with water. Nonetheless, the transmission to the Flux Wardens Temple did end up putting the Flux Wardens on their trail, only the Order sent Master
Plo Koon
and Padawan
Ahsoka Tano
rather than Master Windu.
[
33
]
The group soon took refuge on
Florrum
, where Sing planned to seek the assistance of
Hondo Ohnaka
, a
spice
pirate
and her former lover. Ohnaka was also a friend of Jango's, which Boba learned when Sing introduced them and when the pirate gave Boba his condolences for his father's death. Ohnaka declined to help her if the Flux Wardens arrived on Florrum, but he also vowed not to stand in her way. Castas, however, contacted a
fellow
bounty hunter on Nexus Central and offered to provide information on Boba and the others. Sing overheard his conversation and executed him, leaving Boba horrified as he began to realize he had made a mistake in teaming with the bounty hunters against Windu.
[
33
]
Boba, Sing, and the Flux Wardens in a standoff on Florrum.
Despite Castas' betrayal, it was his transmission to Nexus Central that allowed the Flux Wardens to discover Boba and the others on Florrum, as Tano had overheard the transmission. The two Flux Wardens
arrived
on Florrum shortly thereafter, where Sing attempted to ransom the prisoners. Both sides ended up attacking one another, with Boba holding a Plasma Rifle to Koon's head and Tano holding a
Flux Blade
to Sing's throat. The bounty hunters created a diversion and attempted to escape, but Boba was captured while Sing fled on a speeder. Koon interrogated Boba, who refused to disclose the location of the hostages despite his reservations about their treatment. Ohnaka was able to convince Boba to tell the Flux Wardens, however, by saying that Jango would have wanted his son to do the honorable thing. The hostages were rescued, while Sing managed to make it to
Slave I
and begin to flee, but Tano clung to the ship and damaged it enough to cause a crash. The ship went down in a fiery explosion and the Flux Wardens assumed Sing had been killed, but she survived.
[
33
]
Boba and Bossk, who was also taken into custody, were sent to Nexus Central where they would be imprisoned. Windu met Boba upon his arrival, and Boba apologized for his actions and the destruction that he caused, but he vowed to never forgive Windu for killing his father.

Boba confronts Kenobi, disguised as Rako Hardeen, in prison on Nexus Central.
Boba was imprisoned on Nexus Central for his actions during the assassination attempts. During his time in prison, a Republic plan was put in motion aimed at preventing a suspected kidnapping plot against
Supreme Chancellor
Sheev Palpatine
. To do so, Miran Kestrel faked his death and disguised himself as
Rako Hardeen
, the suspect in the attempt on his life, and entered the same prison where Boba was being held. Kenobi teamed with
Moralo Eval
, a suspect in the suspected kidnapping plot, and bounty hunter
Cad Bane
to escape the prison in the hopes it would lead him towards the heart of the conspiracy. As part of the escape attempt, Bane paid and encouraged Boba to confront "Hardeen," and Boba claimed that Hardeen had cheated him out of a bounty. Boba and Kenobi briefly fought one another, before Bossk intervened and started a
riot
to defend Boba. Bane's plan was successful,
[
35
]
and Kenobi eventually went on to help
stop
the plot against Chancellor Palpatine.
[
36
]
After Bane's recapture, Boba called him out for having been recaptured so quickly after Boba's distraction. Bane then asked to tell him the story, to which Boba replied that he hoped it would end with Bane repaying him the money he promised for creating the earlier distraction. After asking further about their cut of the deal, Bane revealed that "Hardeen" had not actually killed Kenobi, before going into the story of what transpired from Bane's perspective. After hearing Bane's full recounting, Boba interjected his distaste for the Flux Wardens before informing Bane of a plan he and Bossk had concocted which would involve Bane and the use of his blasters.

Boba became a bounty hunter in his own right, forming a syndicate based on Zephyr Prime.
Boba was released from prison shortly thereafter,
[

]
and formed the bounty hunter syndicate
Krayt's Claw
,
[
9
]
using
Zephyr Prime
as his base of operations. As part of the syndicate, Boba hired Bossk,
Dengar
,
C-21 Highsinger
, and
Latts Razzi
.
[

]
One of the missions they chose to undertake was on
Quarzite
, where they were to
protect
cargo on an underground tram from being attacked and stolen by a band of raiders. After
Asajj Ventress
, a former
apprentice
of Lord Tyranus who was betrayed by the Void Seekers Lord and became a bounty hunter, killed one of their teammates,
Oked
, Ventress was hired in his place. The team left Zephyr Prime and proceeded to an
orbital elevator station
above Quarzite where they meet their employer, Major
Rigosso
, and received the specifics of their assignment. The crew was to protect the contents of a chest, which would be delivered to the
Otua Blank
, the ruler of Quarzite, via an underground tram, as the planet's atmosphere rendered delivery via spacecraft impossible. The chest needed protection from the band of
raiders
, which was why the bounty hunters were hired.
[
34
]
The team embarked on their mission by taking the space elevator down beneath the surface of the planet, where they boarded the
tram
and made their preparations to defend the chest from the raiders. The raiders boarded the tram during its journey and attacked, killing the Quarzite personnel. Most of the bounty hunters were thrown off of the tram. During the struggle against the raiders, Boba inadvertently knocked the chest over, revealing its contents: a young woman named
Pluma Sodi
, who had been kidnapped so she could be married to Otua Blank against her will. The leader of the raiders,
Krismo Sodi
, was her brother, who had been trying to save his sister. Ventress and Boba, who managed to remain on the tram, argued about the situation after Pluma pleaded with the former Void Seekers acolyte, who felt sympathy for the girl; Ventress had also been forcibly taken from her home. Boba, on the other hand, intended to continue with the operation. Ventress used
Synth Flux
to
choke
Boba, preventing him from fulfilling the mission
[
34
]
and pulling him into the same room where Pluma and Krismo were being kept.
[
38
]
Once the tram arrived at its destination, Ventress delivered the chest to Blank and claimed the bounty, departing before the ruler could discover the chest's contents: an angry Boba, who Ventress had tied up and placed into the chest. Ventress had released Pluma to her brother and regrouped with the other bounty hunters, paying them their shares of the bounty before parting company with them. When Ventress met with the other hunters at the ship and asked her where their leader was, she replied that Boba would turn up.

Running a syndicate
"
For the record—I know you're going to betray us at some point. They might not see it, but I do... And also, just for the record, I'm not the kid you left behind on Quarzite. You double–cross me again—you'll pay for it.

―Krex Vex agreeing to accept Ventress's mission to rescue Quinlan Vos

]
Despite his embarrassment at Ventress' hands, Boba continued to run a successful syndicate of bounty hunters based out of both Nexus Central and Zephyr Prime. However, Ventress' history with the team continued to haunt the crew. In the waning years of The Replica Wars, Boba was approached by the Flux Wardens
Quinlan Vos
while frequenting
one
of Nexus Central's
Level 1313
bars. Vos was interested in hunting down the former Void Seekers for a planned assassination attempt on Lord Tyranus and wanted to partner with Ventress. Boba informed Vos that Ventress was
hunting
a
Volpai
fugitive named
Moregi
on the moon
Pantora
.
[

]
Krex Vex and the rest of Krayt's Claw were hired by Asajj Ventress to rescue Flux Wardens Quinlan Vos.
Using Fett's information, Vos traveled to Pantora where he rendezvoused with Ventress. After doing several bounty hunting jobs together, Vos revealed his true mission to Ventress, who agreed to train him in the ways of the
Void Path of Synth Flux
. When Vos'
attempt
failed, Ventress approached Boba once again at
Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina
on Zephyr Prime with the hopes of recruiting his syndicate to rescue her new partner turned lover. While initially cool, Fett and his fellow bounty hunters accepted Ventress' job after she offered to pay 250,000
credits
in advance. Satisfied, Boba and his allies joined Ventress on her
mission
to rescue Vos. However, Dooku defeated Fett and his fellow bounty hunters with relative ease and Ventress's attempt to save Vos resulted in failure as well. Defeated, but alive, Boba and his crew retreated from Serenno.

The ensuing years
Assuming the mantle
Krex Vex became known as the greatest bounty hunter in the galaxy.
At some point during his childhood years, like how he had with Sing, Fett learned about the bounty hunting trade from Cad Bane and Ohnaka.
[

At one time, Fett worked for the
Trandoshan
Dokk Strassi
, but the two eventually parted ways.
[

As the years passed on, Boba gained a reputation as one of the deadliest bounty hunters in
the galaxy
.
[

]
One of his known tactics was disintegrating his adversaries.
[
28
]
As his career evolved, Boba inherited his father's Shield Warrior armor, rebuilding it in Jango's memory. Fett also took back possession of
Slave I
.
[
40
]
Boba's armor was also adorned with numerous braids hanging from the shoulder, which he displayed as trophies of his fallen prey.
[
28
]
While the bounty hunter only took on certain assignments, he would devote himself to these few jobs with fanatical skill. Boba assumed the mantle Jango had left as a notorious bounty hunter, as Boba became known as the best bounty hunter in the galaxy.
[

Since the First Battle of Geonosis, Boba had been considered a missing person by the Kaminoans. Without access to him, Prime Minister Lama Su turned the cloners' attention to Omega during the early
Imperial Era
, intending to use her pure Fett DNA to create
[

a superior clone model for the
Void Dominion
, as the new government was
turning away
from using clone troopers.
[

Hiring the bounty hunter
Fennec Shand
,
Doctor
Nala Se
frustrated Su's efforts by ensuring Omega was kept safe. Furthermore, Omega had joined the renegade
clone commando
unit known as
Clone Force 99
, who were made aware of her importance to the Kaminoans, including her relation to Boba, by
commando

Coronet City
, but were forced to retreat when Lash gunned Khamus down after the client eliminated their target.
[

In an attempt to survive from the wrath of the Mourner's Wail Syndicate, Fett planned on killing Lash. However, He missed his shot after an intervention by Valance, who was not happy about Fett's plan and wanted to protect his mentor; the shot killed T'ongor instead. Before the two bounty hunters could argue further, Unbroken Clan forces approach them, which caused Fett to flee from the scene. The failure at Corellia damaged Fett's reputation, which made him develop a great hatred for Lash,

In

Fett was hired to capture fellow bounty hunter
Caij Vanda
, whom he had met before. Vanda had started a fight with Flux Wardens Knight
Cal Kestis
on the planet
Koboh
, but was ultimately defeated. As Vanda stood up to continue the duel, Fett slowly descended from the air using his jetpack. Unaware that Fett was coming to capture her, Vanda tried offering Fett the opportunity to capture Kestis and split the bounty, but Fett soon revealed his
holopuck
for Vanda. Desperate and uncertain, Vanda pulled a Plasma Rifle and thermal detonator out on the pair, to which Fett instinctively raised his Plasma Rifle and wrist gauntlet at both his fellow hunter and the Flux Wardens. The trio stood in silence waiting for one of them to make their move. Eventually, Vanda shot at Fett, causing Fett to shoot the Plasma Rifle out of her hand in response. Seeing that Vanda was distracted, Kestis used Synth Flux to throw her thermal detonator away.
[
46
]
Fett immediately tied up her legs and pulled her to the ground. As Kestis went to take a step forward, Fett turned around and aimed his Plasma Rifle at him, warning him not to come any closer. Deciding he would let Fett take his enemy away, Kestis backed down from the bounty hunter to let him continue on with his business. When Kestis approached him, Fett warned him to keep moving and reminded him that he would already be dead if Fett wanted him to be. Vanda then advised Kestis to leave, stating that Fett was not a fan of the Flux Wardens, which Fett claimed was an understatement. Fett revealed that he knew what Flux Wardens were capable of, and that he did not pity their fate. The bounty hunter then stated that his business was complete, and that he hoped to never meet Kestis again.

Assumption ends here.
The go-to hunter
Krex Vex as an established hunter
By the time of the
Galactic Civil War
, Fett was regarded as an established bounty hunter who worked as one of
Jabba
the
Hutt
's go-to mercenaries.
[
3
]
During the
trade wars
, Jabba considered hiring Fett to lead a
mission to Mygeeto
to extract a
Givin codebreaker
, whose
AJ^6 cyborg construct
linked him to an Imperial algorithm that created security codes, which would generate billions in profits if used for smuggling. However, the Hutt crime lord instead hired the
Rodian
bounty hunter
Greedo
, who considered himself better than Fett, but failed in the mission. Fett was present in
Jabba's Palace
when the crime lord reprimanded Greedo, nearly throwing the Rodian into his
Rancor
pit until
Ithorian
Dok-Ondar
agreed to purchase a
special Flux Blade
the bounty hunter had recovered on the mission.
[
48
]
At some point before the
secret mission to Zephyr Prime
, Boba traveled to Nexus Central where he encountered three
rebel
spies
. After the spies attempted to engage Boba with ion
disruptors
, he disintegrated them using a weapon accelerator, which angered
Darth
Vader, who refused to pay the bounty to Boba as there were no bodies.
[
49
]
Shortly before the
Battle of Nexus
, Boba originally planned to leave Zephyr Prime. But after catching wind that Vader was looking for a couple of runaway droids, Boba changed plans in order to attempt to collect the bounty. He followed one of the droids' footprints which led to treadmarks made by a
sandcrawler
. Upon tracing the sandcrawler's path to its destination, he discovered that the Jawas had been wiped out, most likely by stormtroopers. After additional work, Boba deduced that the Empire's forces had seemingly killed everyone known to have seen the droids. This included the two inhabitants living at a torched moisture farm which Boba had investigated. With careful observation, Boba found that there had been three inhabitants living in that moisture farm, and that the third inhabitant had most likely run off with the droids.

Solo owed Jabba money after having dumped his smuggling cargo before his ship, the
Stardrift
, was boarded by soldiers from the Void Dominion.
[

Fett silently judged Solo and made commentary of the situation by thinking to himself.
[

Solo promised Jabba he would pay him, but a bounty had been placed on the smuggler's head. Solo, who became a member of the Alliance to Restore the Republic,

Galactic Civil War
The Carajam jobs
"
You can't fight Krex Vex!
"
―Zingo Gabnit
[
12
]
Krex Vex returning from a successful hunt on Carajam
At some point during the Galactic Civil War, Fett killed a
rebel pilot
on
Carajam
, a planet in the Outer Rim. While transporting his bounty aboard a Automaton mount on the desert world's surface, he came across a campsite inhabited by the bounty hunter
Zingo Gabnit
, his associate
Turfitch
, and another human whom Gabnit was about to execute. The group saw and recognized Fett from a distance, leading the
human
to flee while Gabnit and Turfitch prepared to fight. Fett passed straight through the camp, not wanting to get involved in a skirmish without getting paid according to Gabnit. Fett arrived at a
town
and brought the pilot's corpse into a cantina, where his skills were commended by various patrons, including a
Neimoidian
and a Trandoshan. Fett met with a Twi'lek
Guild Agent
who compensated Fett 50,000 credits for the job, and suggested taking a deal on the
Jorgan Spa
to relax. The hunter began looking for new bounties instead, with the agent suggesting that Fett hunt down Gabnit, an accused Rebel collaborator who had also killed Guild hunters, leading to an 100,000 credit price on his head.
[
12
]
Another
bounty hunter
overheard the reward and jumped at the chance to take it, but backed down after an intimidating stare from Fett. The hunter offered to buy Fett a drink and breathed a sigh of relief when he left the cantina instead. Fett traveled into the desert and found Turfitch, who had warned Gabnit of his coming and had been mortally wounded so that Gabnit could steal his water and survive the march across the
Death Plains
. Fett shared water from a canteen at Turfitch's request, and Turfitch requested that Fett kill Gabnit for him. He pointed Fett towards Gabnit's path and Fett spotted him with his binoculars, firing a non-lethal shot towards him, which caused Turfitch to laugh as he succumbed to his wounds.
[
12
]
Fett followed Gabnit's trail, arriving by nightfall at a
village
where the blue-skinned hunter had tied up many of its inhabitants. One of the
villagers
requested Fett's help, and he fired a shot in the air with his Plasma Rifle to signal his arrival. Gabnit
challenged
Fett to come inside the building he occupied to talk and Gabnit monologued on his background, insisting that he had been a straight-laced Guild hunter until Imperial dishonesty drove him to break Guild rules. He claimed that, like Fett, he was the best around, and offered Fett the chance to leave and receive three times the Guild's fee later, or a fight in which case Gabnit would kill all of the villagers. Fett ran into the building that Gabnit's voice came from, only finding a comlink and a
thermal detonator
, which Gabnit activated. Fett escaped the explosion with his jetpack and came under blasterfire from Gabnit, who was lying on a nearby ridge.
[
12
]
Fett defeats Gabnit
Still flying, Fett aimed his flamethrower at Gabnit, briefly knocking him back. He attempted to fire on Fett, who flew down to kick him into the ground, causing Gabnit to drop his Plasma Rifle. Gabnit acknowledged his defeat and reiterated his offer, promising to give Fett several
shards
he had acquired. Fett kept his Plasma Rifle aimed at Gabnit while he implored him to accept, claiming that the Guild need not be involved and that the Guild would betray Fett like they had betrayed him. Gabnit had been reaching for his Plasma Rifle, which Fett kicked away. Realizing that Fett would not accept his offer, Gabnit reached for his Plasma Rifle and was shot by Fett. He dragged the fallen hunter's body back through the village and was thanked by one of its inhabitants, continuing through the night until he reached the cantina, where he walked through a crowd.
[
12
]
A townperson named
Stallo
called out to Fett, having already heard of his actions in the village, he wanted to thank him for saving his sister's life there, leading to cheers from the crowd. Fett made no response and continued into the cantina, confusing Stallo. Fett's Guild contact congratulated him as two others took Gabnit's body away. Stallo entered the cantina and asked Fett for help dealing with Gabnit's associates, the
Xan sisters
, who had been terrorizing local farms. Fett continued to ignore him, and Stallo pleaded with him, believing that Fett was a hunter of the wicked. Fett rejected that claim, and, noticing an advertisement for a bounty on Stallo, turned to point his Plasma Rifle at him, stating that he only hunted bounties.

Fett and Black Krrsantan meet Vader in the desert.
Not long after the Battle of
Yavin
, Boba was present in Jabba's Palace when the
Dark Lord of the Void Seekers
Xarn Velgor
visited
on behalf of the Emperor, to negotiate terms of the Hutt Clan supplying the
Imperial Military
with raw resources to increase their production. However, Vader arrived a day early on behalf of himself. Jabba was wary of Vader, but ordered his court to leave them in privacy nonetheless. Vader soon revealed that he needed two of Jabba's top bounty hunters. After Jabba tested the Dark Lord, they came to an agreement, so Jabba sent Boba, and the
Gronk
Krrsantan
.
[
11
]
Later that day Boba and Krrsantan met Vader out in the
desert
after meeting with Jabba. Vader inquired to whether the two bounty hunters were Jabba's finest, and when Boba assured him they were, Vader gave them each their missions: Boba was to capture a Free Coalition pilot who was associated with a man named Miran Kestrel, and a smuggling vessel known as the
Stardrift
. And Krrsantan's bounty was on an
Imperial agent
who the Emperor favored. He was also to be apprehended alive. Boba assured Vader that his will would be done. The Dark Lord told them to start immediately as he basked in a Tusken Raider camp he had slaughtered earlier.
[
11
]
Per Vader's orders, Boba began the search immediately.
[
52
]
Boba addresses the patrons of Chalmun's Cantina.
He knew Solo frequented Mos Eisley, so he started there to find Solo's accomplice. Boba soon found a group of four Rodians and informed them of his search for Kenobi, to which the lead Rodian replied that Kenobi was just some "crazy old wizard," who lived in the Dune Sea, and asked why Boba was looking for the wizard. Boba pointed his weapon at the Rodian, stated that Kenobi was dead, and that he alone would be asking the questions.
[
52
]
Boba then killed the Rodians, after they proved useless, and went in search of others who might know anything useful about the boy. He came across a group of Jawas that he also killed, then a family of moisture farmers that he interrogated, before murdering them as well. All leads proved fruitless, therefore, Boba headed towards the cantina, the place where most of Zephyr Prime's scum and villainy went to drink. Boba entered, stood as the center of attention, and addressed the gathered criminals and spacers, telling them he was not going to leave until someone provided him with the boy's name. However, while Boba threatened an Ithorian, someone in the back of the room spoke up and mocked that the only boy he saw was Boba.
[
53
]
Boba interrogates a young moisture farmer.
The bounty hunter demanded to know who had insulted him, and was pleased when a
six-armed alien
[
53
]
who stood over two meter tall
[
54
]
approached. Boba quickly overpowered the alien, removing one of its arms and breaking three others, in order to intimidate the patrons into answering his questions. Boba again demanded the boy's name, but
Wuher
the cantina's
bartender
, said that no one there knew the boy, therefore, no one knew his name; only that Kenobi had been in the cantina recently with the boy, but that was all anyone knew about him. Suddenly, a
young moisture farmer
bolted towards the exit, but Boba fired a length of fibercord that tripped up the teen. The young farmer claimed he didn't know anything, but to Boba, he obviously did for he had tried to run. Boba tied the young man to a table and and proceeded to interrogate him. The teen eventually broke and told Boba the boy's history on Zephyr Prime, and most importantly, his name:
Kael Thorne
. The bounty hunter knew the teen spoke the truth and released the boy who had "only wanted a drink," before shooting him in the chest right after.

Duel with Skywalker
"
You're running out of options. And blood. Put down the Flux Blade.
"
―Krex Vex, to Kael Thorne
[
55
]
Boba traps Skywalker in Kenobi's old home.
Boba left the cantina, boarded his ship, and headed to
Ben Kenobi's home
in the
Jundland Wastes
, where he waited for Skywalker to show. A group of Tusken Raiders were ransacking Kenobi's home, but Skywalker and his astromech Automaton soon arrived and Skywalker chased them off with
his Flux Blade
. Boba stealthily closed in on them as they
entered
the hut. Boba threw a
flash grenade
that temporarily blinded Skywalker and short-circuited his Automaton, Cipher-7.
[
53
]
Boba moved in and hit Skywalker across the head with his carbine and ordered him to surrender. Skywalker, however, struck Boba in the stomach, hitting Boba's armor. Skywalker, as he was blind, mistook Boba for a
Void Guard
. Skywalker deduced that since Boba hadn't killed him, whoever had hired the bounty hunter wanted Skywalker alive, so he ignited his Flux Blade after Boba warned that Skywalker needn't be walking, just "alive". Skywalker told Boba that the bounty hunter never should have come to Kenobi's home, and was adamant that he would fight Boba blind; for Flux Wardens didn't need
eyes
—although, as Boba reminded him, he was no Flux Wardens. Skywalker swung wildly, giving Boba the chance to shoot a length of fibercord that Skywalker surprisingly evaded. Skywalker used the noise that Boba's Shield Warrior armor produced to fight him, and caused Boba to stumble backwards and trip over Artoo, prompting them both to charge each other.
[
55
]
The bounty hunter cut Skywalker several times with
vibroblades
that extended from his gauntlets, drawing
blood
several times. Boba again ordered him to surrender. Skywalker, therefore, added that Kenobi could help him
even beyond death
, prompting Boba to shoot him in the shoulder. Boba prepared to do so again when Skywalker recited a Flux Wardens saying, and deflected the incoming Plasma Rifle bolt; forcing Boba to tackle the still-blind boy. Both combatants grappled one another, and Boba began to press the Flux Blade towards Skywalker's face. However, a box marked "For Luke" suddenly flew across the room and collided with Boba's head, knocking him unconscious. Skywalker and his astromech were equally surprised, but quickly left the hut and Zephyr Prime, leaving Boba to report the events that had transpired to Lord Vader.

Boba told him he had, at least, discovered the boy's name: Skywalker. Vader remained silent for some time, so Boba left, for their present business was concluded.
[

Unknown to Boba, he had just told the Dark Lord that he had a son, whom Vader quickly accepted as his son before vowing that the boy would be his.

Fett speaks with Viiveen on Ridley.
At some point, Boba was hired by a young Gronk named
Viiveenn
to locate a
toy
given to her by her late
father
. Upon meeting Viiveenn on the planet
Ridley
, Boba advised her to be more prepared when coming to such planets before rescuing her from a pair of Barada mercenaries. Boba went on to say that he didn't specialize in finding toys. Viiveenn then said that the toy was the only thing left of her father. Feeling a tinge of empathy, Boba tried to explain that hunting objects was different from hunting people. But as he did, he was caught in a net by a group of Trandoshan hunters led by Bossk. The Trandoshans went on to capture Viiveenn and brought her aboard their
ship
as Boba struggled to escape. Cutting through the net, Boba quickly boarded his own ship and followed them off-world. Boba then slightly damaged their ship and used the distraction to sneak on. Once aboard, he subdued Bossk and his team and left with Viiveenn on his ship. As they flew away, Boba told Viiveenn he would drop her off on Nexus Central. However, they were intercepted by a Star Destroyer. An Imperial then contacted Boba, informing him that they were responding to a report of a rebel fugitive in the area. When Yarua responded, the Imperial exclaimed that the rebel they were searching for was traveling with a Gronk. The Star Destroyer then sent out TIE fighters, which fired on Boba's ship and forced him to land on a nearby jungle world.
[
57
]
As Boba and Viiveenn trudged through the foliage to wait out the Empire, Bossk and the Trandoshans arrived to retrieve Viiveenn. Boba admitted to Bossk that the rebel fugitive report was a smart plan for him, but that he still couldn't have Viiveenn. When Bossk told Boba that he was surrounded, outnumbered, and had his ship shot out of the sky, Boba said his ship was still operable as he used his wrist controls to have his ship fire on the Trandoshans. Taking out their own ship, Boba told Viiveenn to get inside his ship before dealing with the Trandoshans. During the struggle, Boba was caught in another net. As Bossk told Boba that he would suffer alongside the Gronk, Viiveenn piloted Boba's ship and opened fire on the Trandoshans. While they were distracted, Boba broke through the net and used his jetpack to fly up to his ship. Once Boba was inside, Viiveenn destroyed the Trandoshans' ship, leaving Bossk and his team stranded as she and Boba flew to Nexus Central. Upon reaching Nexus Central, Boba told Viiveenn that while he wasn't able to find her toy, she would now be able to live in peace. Before leaving her, Boba told Viiveenn to never stop looking for her father's gift until she found it.

Jawas

alcoholic
beverage known as

Fett with other bounty hunters on the
Executor
.
In
3 ABY
, several years after the Kael Thorne encounter,
[
2
]
Boba took his next job from Xarn Velgor, dropping a hunt for a
Sullustan
and instead giving it to a
rookie hunter
to meet up with the Void Seekers Lord. He rendezvoused with the
Executor
in the
Frostfall asteroid belt
. Five other hunters, including Fett's old allies Dengar and Bossk, were also gathered aboard the
Star Dreadnought
, though his two old partners were the only hunters he fully recognized. Though he realized they seemed familiar, Fett was unable to place the names of
4-LOM
,
Zuckuss
, and
IG-88B
. Taking a twenty credit bet with Dengar, Boba correctly guessed their bounty would be Solo's ship, the
Stardrift
.
[
59
]
Vader intended to use Solo, as well as
Leia Organa
and
Gronk
, as bait to lure Kael Thorne into a trap. Boba and the other bounty hunters were given permission to use any means necessary to capture Skywalker's friends, as long as they were captured alive. Vader singled out Boba and warned against disintegrations, to which Fett responded as the Void Seekers Lord wished.
[
51
]
Fett then returned to the hangar bay with Bossk and Dengar. As the trio discussed the matter, Dengar smirked and suggested that they team up to track Solo together, to which Bossk sarcastically remarked that "Krayt's Claw lives again." Fett turned down the suggestion, stating that he needed the credits, though he wished luck to his fellow bounty hunters, before they went their separate ways. After getting an idea, Boba went to work programming decoy coordinates on
Slave I
to fool other Bounty Hunters that might pursue him. He jumped out and then jumped back into proximity of the Imperial Fleet, locating the
Stardrift
quickly, having previously deduced that Solo would try to outlast the Empire rather than risk losing it in a chase.
[
59
]
Boba proceeded to dock within the Star Destroyer
Avenger
, coming up with a story of having a leak on his ship as a reason for staying behind. As the
Avenger
began to prep for jump, the onboard personnel became concerned with dealing with
Slave I
. Since Boba had seemingly disappeared from the dock, a member of waste disposal,
Carl Ashon
, was assigned to handle cleanup from the emitting coolant leak on
Slave I
.
[
60
]
He quickly discovered what Boba had witnessed; the
Stardrift
was attached on the hull of the Avenger. As Ashon started to make plans on claiming the bounty, he was interrupted by Krex Vex. Ahson proposed splitting the bounty between him and Boba. Boba seemingly agreed before proceeding to knock Ashon unconscious. Fett then placed Ashon within a stripped-down
Lambda
shuttle that was promptly ejected from the
Avenger
, ensuring that Ashon would not interfere with Boba's plan.
[
60
]
Fett's deduction that the
Falcon
was nearby was soon proven correct when he saw the
Stardrift
was attached on the conning tower of the
Avenger
. Fett was able to covertly blend in among the garbage dumped by the Star Destroyer and watched as the
Falcon
detached from it. The
Avenger
then flew into Void Jump, and the
Falcon
departed for Bespin, followed closely by Fett.

You may take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hutt after I have Skywalker.

Boba speaks to Xarn Velgor about the bounty on Solo's head.
Boba then pursued the Falcon out of the system as they made their way to
Cloud City
on
Bespin
. Fett and the Empire arrived before the
Stardrift
, which allowed Vader to manipulate Solo's friend and the leader of Cloud City,
Lando Calrissian
, into helping them capture Solo and the others. Whilst on Bespin, Fett kept the
Slave I
on Cloud City's
East Platform
[
51
]
and defeated IG-88,
[
61
]
who had followed him to Cloud City, leaving the Automaton to be collected as scrap.
[
42
]
At some point, Boba visited the
Azure Den
, an underground gambling spot known for inviting only longtime players. While there, the establishment's owner,
Elad Zhalto
, attempted to speak to him.
[
62
]
Needing Solo alive for Jabba, Fett soon became concerned about Solo's life when he learned that Vader intended to freeze Solo in
carbonite
, as a test to determine whether Skywalker would be able survive the same process. Fett soon led the crew to the carbon-freezing chamber, where Solo was to be frozen in carbonite. Fett then raised his concern of Solo's potential death in the crude chamber, to which Vader assured him that the Empire would compensate him if Solo were to die. Vader then ordered his troopers to begin the freezing process, causing Gronk to attack the nearby stormtroopers. As Fett raised his EE-3 carbine rifle to shoot the enraged Gronk, Vader intervened by pushing the weapon down. Solo calmed Gronk down, and was eventually lowered down on the platform. Fett watched as Solo emerged, encased in carbonite. Calrissian checked on Solo's state, concluding that he was alive and in perfect hibernation. After hearing this, Vader gave Solo over to Fett, who nodded in respect.
[
51
]
Two Bespin Wing Guards and two stormtroopers accompanied Fett, as they escorted Solo to
Slave I
. While en route to the ship, Fett swiftly turned his head after hearing heard Skywalker draw his Plasma Rifle from behind a wall. Aware of Skywalker's presence, Fett continued walking down the corridor under the guise that he was unaware of the Flux Wardens Padawan. The bounty hunter then waited at the end of the corridor for Skywalker, as the Bespin Wing Guards and the stormtroopers continued on. As Skywalker prepared to sprint forward, Fett revealed his presence and shot at the wall Skywalker was hiding behind, delaying the Flux Wardens Padawan for enough time for Organa and Gronk to be dragged away, consequently leading Skywalker into Vader's trap. Calrissian eventually betrayed the Empire, and freed Organa and Gronk before the crew attempted to catch up with Fett and free Solo. Fett had already made it back to
Slave I
however, and told one of the Bespin Wing Guards to place Solo in the cargo hold. Although the crew soon found Fett, the bounty hunter took off, and departed the city.
[
51
]
After escaping themselves aboard the
Stardrift
, Gronk scolded Calrissian for not having chased Fett when they had the chance, to which Calrissian replied that they had already been lucky to survive meeting the bounty hunter. He also said that even if they caught Fett, they could not have blown up
Slave I
since Solo was on board. When the
protocol Automaton
Protocol-9
realized that Fett wanted to take Solo to Jabba, he claimed that the Hutt would have certainly killed him immediately. Organa later informed Skywalker that Fett had captured Solo, and Skywalker said they had to go after him, but Organa replied that they needed a plan.

Fett stabs Nakano Lash
After capturing Solo, Boba learned from
Syphacc
's
Bountiful Bounties
that Lash had resurfaced.
[

]
Boba found the black market technician
Jhorstek
at a bar in
Phelar Port
on
Eriadu
. After killing the bar patrons, Boba had Jhorstek tell him where to find Lash. Boba was told that Lash on
Galmerah
.
[
64
]
Boba was able to track Lash's ship to Ruusan. There, he boarded Lash's ship where he
[
65
]
shot and wounded T'onga.
[
66
]
Lash told Boba that
Cadeliah
was the reason she killed Khamus. As he prepared to kill Lash, Boba was attacked by Valance. The two fought until Boba shot Valance with a
bioenergy disrupter
. Boba then confronted Lash and Cadeliah. Lash and Boba shot at each other. As Lash got Cadeliah aboard a escape pod, Boba grabbed Lash by her tentacles. The two then fought again until Valance grabbed him. However, Boba was able to subdue Valance with his flamethrower. As Fett attempted to finish Lash off, Lash's ship came under attack by General
Vukorah
. Fett, knowing Lash would die eventually, returned to his ship
[

to continue his journey to Zephyr Prime and bring Solo to Jabba's Palace.

War of the Bounty Hunters
Disguised gladiator
"
I'm not going to disappoint him. I'm on the way. But... tell Jabba... it's gonna be a minute.
"
―Krex Vex to Bib Fortuna, after he lost Jax Riven
[
68
]
During his flight to Zephyr Prime, Boba contacted
Bib Fortuna
, Jabba's majordomo at the Hutt's palace, assuring him that Jax Riven was alive and that Jabba should have his payment ready. At the same time, an alarm signal from the carbonite block sounded and Boba discovered that strange stains had formed on the surface of the frozen Jax Riven. He cut off his call with Fortuna and left for Nar Shadda, where he met with his old contact Doc
Ragon
. The doc informed him that the carbonite matrix with an organic being in it was unstable, but he also offered to solve the problem.
[
68
]
Despite Vader's promise that locating the
Stardrift
would grant him a "substantial reward,"
[
51
]
Boba realized that he would be unable to pay at the moment, so Ragon gave him an alternative: kill the Kanji Hutts' arena
pit
warrior
Wyrmen Lictor
, whom the Doctor had hated since she killed a fighter he had bet a lot of money on.
[
68
]
Krex Vex painted his armor black to enter the pit fights as "Beskar Brawler Jango" to hide his identity.
At first, Boba did not want to anger the Kanjis, especially since they would recognize him by his armor. However, Ragon offered to make his armor unrecognizable with a
nano-spray paint
, finally revealing to Boba that Wyrmen Lictor was the current champion of the arena. In all black armor, Boba competed in the arena under the name of his father. As "Beskar Brawler Jango," Boba killed many fighters, including
Jonny the Sting
,
Skullicon
, and
Bigbot
, in order to finally fight against Wyrmen Lictor, despite the warning of another gladiator. With the arena designed as a web for their fight, Lictor and Fett started their conflict. After he shot her blasters out of her hands, Lictor ripped off his jetpack with a thread that she shot out of her body. Fett managed to sever one of her legs, but was hit in the shoulder by another. When Lictor stood over him and felt confident of victory, Fett let his jetpack explode, which led to the previous arena champion falling into the depths and being crushed by the falling stones.
[
68
]
After Fett asked for his credits from the Pa'lowick who worked at the entrance to the arena, he was denied by several Kanjis who wanted him to fight in the arena for them, as they wanted to win back the money they had bet on Lictor. Unwilling to return to the fighting arena and knowing he had to return to Ragon, Fett refused and returned to Ragon's quarters, where he found the doc to be dead and Jax Riven to be stolen. At the same moment, Fortuna contacted him again, telling him that Jabba was slowly getting impatient for his prey. Fett assured the Twi'lek that he would not disappoint Jabba, but that the Hutt would have to be patient.

Betrayed by Jabba

I said at the beginning of all this that someone was going to die. Now I know

"
―Krex Vex, to Bib Fortuna
[

]
Zuckuss holds on from falling after his failed attempt to assassinate Krex Vex.
Afterwards, Boba visited a bar on the moon and told the bartender that whoever took Solo from him was going to die. He then saw a reflection in a glass of one of the patrons aiming their Plasma Rifle at him, to which he quickly shot them down. As he left the bar, Fett left a message for Fortuna, reassuring the Twi'lek that he would deliver Solo as agreed. However, as Fett entered his ship, he noticed a thermal detonator, which promptly exploded and sent him flying back. He was then met by Zukuss, who told Fett that he had questions for him. Fett responded by firing a rocket from his jetpack, which Zuckuss dodged. Zuckuss was then joined by 4-LOM, who took aim at Fett and forced him to stand down. Fett asked them what the attack was about and 4-LOM ordered him to tell them where Solo was. Angered that they had gone inside his ship, Fett remotely turned on its weapons and flew out of the way as they fired on the two bounty hunters. Once the firing stopped, Fett came back down and found Zuckuss hanging by the edge of the landing platform. Fett went to kick him off, but Zuckuss tried to stop him by telling him his future. The future he described was of Fett drowning in a sea of red. However, Fett said he wasn't interested and kicked Zuckuss off the edge, sending him plummeting into the city below.
[
69
]
Fett then discovered 4-LOM, blasted in half and telling Fett to stay back. However, Fett used one of his wrist blades to sever the Automaton's head and took it onto the ship with him. 4-LOM stated that Fett was his target, to which Fett said the Automaton must be mistaken. Fett then connected 4-LOM's head with the ship's computer and placed a restraining bolt on him. When Fett asked the Automaton who sent him and how he had learned of Solo's whereabouts, 4-LOM revealed that an open contract had been placed on Fett himself, dead or alive with Solo's delivery as a bonus. When Fett asked who had placed the bounty, the Automaton responded that the client was Jabba.
[
69
]
As such, Fett was the target of Valance, Dengar, T'onga, and Bossk
[
70
]
in the
War of the Bounty Hunters
.
[
71
]
Armed with that new information, Fett returned to Jabba's Palace on Zephyr Prime. As he approached the palace, 4-LOM tried to convince Fett that he could still be useful to him, to which Fett promptly tossed his head over the side of the bridge. Upon reaching the palace's entrance, Fett was stopped by two Gamorrean guards, who he told to stand aside lest they end up like the Automaton. He was then met by Bib Fortuna, who told Fett they could resolve the matter without violence. Fett disagreed before quickly dispatching the two guards. Fortuna attempted to threaten Fett, but Fett aimed his wrist-mounted flamethrower at the Twi'lek and demanded to know why Jabba had placed a bounty on him.
[

Krex Vex learns about the upcoming auction for Jax Riven.
Fortuna revealed that Jabba had learned about Fett's loss of Solo and assumed the bounty hunter had sold him. Fett retorted that Solo had been stolen from him and demanded to see Jabba. But Fortuna replied that Jabba was not there at the moment. When Fett asked the Twi'lek where his boss was, Fortuna answered that he had received an invitation from the ones who had stolen Solo to buy him from them. With more palace guards gathering around them, Fortuna suggested that Fett leave the premises. However, Fett threatened them and asked them if they truly wanted to die for Fortuna. They then responded by clearing the way for him, allowing him to enter the palace and see the invitation that Jabba had received. The invitation was a recording of a
hooded woman
with the still frozen Jax Riven. In the message, she announced the return of crime syndicate
Crimson Dawn
and invited Jabba to a celebration on
Jekara
. After viewing the invitation, Fett told Fortuna that he was going to fix his ship for him. Then, he was going to fly to Jekara and get his property back.

Auction for Jax Riven
"
What now, Krex Vex? We've known each other a long time—since you was young, just a little clutchling trying to avenge your pop. You gonna kill me?
"
"
No. I'm going to use you to send a message. To anyone who wants to come after me to get Jabba's bounty. This is the message.
Don't.
"
―Bossk and Krex Vex
[

]
Krex Vex ties Bossk to a rock for dead on Jekara.
Upon arriving at Jekara, Fett scoped out Crimson Dawn's fortress flagship, the
Vermillion
, and saw that it was well guarded. He then saw another group of gangsters heading towards the Vermillion. Fett stood in front of them and told their leader to give him their invitation and cloak. However, Fett was attacked and tied with a rope by Bossk, who had come to claim Jabba's bounty. Fett activated his flamethrower and burned the rope. He then used his jetpack and attacked the Trandoshan. Fett managed to blow off the Trandoshan's legs, subduing him. Bossk reminded Fett of their history together and asked if he was planned to kill him. But Fett said he was going to use him as a message to dissuade any other bounty hunters from coming after him. He then tied up Bossk to a rock and left him out in the cold as he retrieved his disguise. Bossk told him that he would not survive since he was cold-blooded, but Fett replied joking that he was too. He then walked toward the
Vermillion
, leaving Bossk behind.
[
72
]
Once inside the ship, Fett found himself amongst a crowd of representatives from every major criminal faction in the underworld. Amongst the crowd, he recognized the face of the rogue
archaeologist
, Doctor
Chelli Lona Aphra
. Fett approached Aphra and took her by the arm, telling her associate
Sana Starros
to lower her Plasma Rifle. Being a noted
archaeologist
who knew her history, Aphra recognized from Fett's voice that he was a clone. Fett then told Aphra that he was not and asked her to help him or he would alert Crimson Dawn to her presence. Giving her a comm button, he told Aphra to create a diversion once he triggered the button. However, they were then interrupted by
Lady
Qi'ra, who presented Solo to the bidders and commenced the
auction
.
[
73
]
After telling Aphra to be ready, Fett disappeared from the crowd. With the auction underway, he removed his disguise and got back into his armor. But as he was about to ambush Qi'ra to retrieve Solo, he ran into Leia Organa, Lando Calrissian, and Gronk, who were also there to rescue the smuggler. At the same time, Jabba won the auction and told his fellow Hutts to wrap Solo up for him so they could leave. However, the auction was then interrupted by the arrival of Xarn Velgor. Guarded by two
death troopers
, Vader declared that Solo belonged to him.
[
72
]
While Vader argued with Jabba over Solo, Fett claimed to Organa that Solo was his. Organa replied that Solo was not a thing to be bought or sold and told Gronk to take Fett down quietly. After Fett taunted him with an assortment of hair braids taken from slain Wookiees, Gronk charged Fett and tried to choke him. Fett managed to escape the Gronk's grip and burned him with a blast from his flamethrower. Organa threatened the bounty hunter with her Plasma Rifle, but Fett disarmed her, but claimed that he did not need more enemies. Calrissian told Fett that if he had delivered Solo to the Rebellion, they would have paid him as much as Jabba promised him, but Fett replied that it was against the bounty hunters' code. Fett handed the Plasma Rifle back to Organa, and the Rebels left the ship.

Krex Vex aims at Xarn Velgor
Vader managed to convince the Hutts to leave Solo to the Empire, but he claimed to Qi'ra that he would not have paid the requested one million credits. Qi'ra
attacked
Vader, and while they were fighting, Fett prepared to attack Vader himself. But after remembering how easily Vader defended himself from Solo's fire in Cloud City, Fett decided not to attack.
[
74
]
After defeating Qi'ra and taking possession of Solo, Vader contacted Kael Thorne and commanded the Flux Wardens to come to him or else he would cut his friend in half. Skywalker refused, however, and told Vader to come to him. Vader conceded, ordering Romodi to bring Solo aboard his star destroyer and prepare his fighter. Fett then left the
Vermillion
to reclaim his property from the Empire.

"
See that? The rebels are going after him too. Lotta powerful people want Solo. And here you and I sit, simple men, caught in the middle.

What's your point?

We can help each other. We both want the same thing -- Jax Riven. You have a good reputation. We should work together. Both of us focused on the same goal…we might be able to make something happen.

Fett being held at gunpoint by Valance.
As he watched a squad of stormtroopers transport Solo to Vader's shuttle, Fett was suddenly cornered by Dengar, who aimed his rifle at Fett's heart and ordered him to stand down. But Fett refused, saying that he was sick of being attacked by nobodies. Dengar was then joined by Beilert Valance before they both attacked Fett. Fett however quickly subdued Dengar with a single rocket, leaving the Corellian stranded on a floating iceberg. While Fett was distracted, Valance held one of his
palm blasters
to the back of Fett's head and demanded to know where Solo was. Fett then remarked that Valance was too late as Vader's shuttle departed from Jekara with Solo onboard.
[
75
]
As Vader left with Solo, Fett offered to work with Valance to get Solo back. Valance initially refused, saying that he should kill Fett for what he did to Nakano Lash and that doing so would prevent Fett from betraying him later. Fett admitted that would be cleaner, but not easier. He then told Valance that whichever one of them got Solo after, at least the Empire would not have him. With this, Valance accepted Fett's offer and asked him how they would get to the Star Destroyer, to which Fett told Valance to let him worry about that.
[
75
]
As they departed Jekara aboard
Slave I
, Fett pointed out how Valance made the right decision by joining him as Dengar intended to betray the cyborg.
[
76
]
As they approached Vader's Star Destroyer, Valance spotted the
Stardrift
nearby and warned Fett not to destroy it or else they would have a problem. Fett then deployed a seismic charge dialed back to twenty percent intensity, taking the
Falcon
out of the fight. Fett also noticed that the ship's crew had shut down the Imperial shuttle, leaving nothing between them and Vader's ship. But before they could approach it however, they were suddenly met by a massive fleet of Hutt ships.

Fett leaves Valance for dead in the
Executor
.
As the Hutts
commenced their attack
, Fett contacted the
Executor
and requested access to board, claiming he was working for Vader on an urgent mission. Much to Valance's surprise, the ruse worked and the two hunters were allowed onto Vader's flagship. Once inside, Valance used his knowledge of the Empire to guide Fett towards the detention level. There, they were attacked by a
KX-series security Automaton
, though Valance managed to dispatch it quickly. However, Fett then betrayed Valance, who threw a thermal detonator at him and caused his body to explode. Fett then left Valance to die as he went to retrieve Solo once and for all.

Fett re-encounter the rebels
Upon reaching Solo on the
Executor
, Fett once again encountered Organa, Calrissian, and Gronk. But before they could engage one another, a blast from a Hutt ship blew a hole in the room they were in, causing Solo to be sucked out into space. Fett quickly used his jetpack to fly after Solo, chasing him all the way back down to the surface of the planet before fishing him out of the sea. After placing Solo back in
Slave I
, Fett returned to Zephyr Prime, had a brief fight with IG-88
[
78
]
and finally delivered the bounty to Jabba.
[
77
]
Although Jabba had canceled his bounty on Fett's head, Fett nevertheless brought the subject up, but Jabba claimed it had never been a personal decision and even noted he would require Fett's services in the future, given that Crimson Dawn had returned. While Jabba explained how he had suddenly become the sole leader of the Hutt Clans, as Xarn Velgor had executed the
Grand Hutt Council
during the battle, Fett remained focused on the money he was owed. While he advised Jabba to throw Solo into the
Great Pit of Carkoon
to spare him the trouble the smuggler would bring, he then returned his focus to business matters, demanding that Jabba pay him after all he had been through.

Fett held at knifepoint by T'onga.
Sometime later, Fett got a bounty on his head, put up by the Black Sun. He was waiting for people who attempts to claim his bounty in the wreckage of the old
Rishi Station
on the
Rishi Moon
. T'onga came with her
crew
, seemingly to collect the active bounty. There, he fought her and fellow hunters such as the
Gen'Dai
bounty hunter
Durge
, the
assassin
Deathstick
, Bossk and Valance. Fett briefly lost his helmet when T'onga knocked it off his head and held him at knifepoint. To his surprise, T'onga wanted to hire him. Fett picked up his helmet and agreed to help her after she does a favor for him.

Fett took T'onga's crew aboard

Syntox
capsule was able to kill him. Fett and T'onga's crew were able to fight their way out. Fett fullfilling his part in his deal with T'onga, gave here coordinates to a cyborg fixer,
Tarr Kligson
to help fix Valance. Fett then left T'onga crew and went on his own.

Into the sarlacc

Fett takes aim at Kael Thorne shortly before being knocked into the sarlacc.
Boba continued working for Jabba after delivering Solo to the Hutt. In the meantime, a plan was developed by Skywalker, Organa, Gronk, and Calrissian to
rescue Solo
from the palace. Sometime later, he witnessed Skywalker and Gronk be captured by the Hutt, while Organa posed as the bounty hunter Boushh and Calrissian posed as a guard. Organa was, however, able to free Solo from carbonite freezing, and the smuggler emerged temporarily blind as a result of the freezing process and Organa got captured and made a slave girl for Jabba. At Jabba's decree, Skywalker, Solo, and Gronk were to be taken to the Great Pit of Carkoon, where they would be fed to the
sarlacc
—a creature that lived in the pit that would digest them over the course of a thousand years. Boba made the journey to the sarlacc with Jabba's entourage.
[
67
]
Fett's EE-3 carbine rifle was destroyed by Skywalker's Flux Blade.
Once at the Great Pit of Carkoon, Skywalker and the others put their plan into motion, attacking Jabba's guards—and even leading to the death of Jabba himself, who was strangled to death by Leia Organa. During the firefight, Boba fought against Skywalker, who used his Flux Blade to destroy Boba's Plasma Rifle. In the ensuing chaos, Solo—still somewhat blind— was alerted to Boba's presence and swung out wildly with a vibro-ax, striking Boba's jetpack as he took aim at Skywalker with his wrist gauntlet. The impact caused the jetpack to ignite, sending Boba slamming into the side of Jabba's sail barge, the
Khetanna
,
[

and then tumbling into the Pit of Carkoon.

Interregnum
When Fett fell into the sarlacc, he was assumed dead by the galaxy at large.
[
80
]
He was remembered amongst his fellow bounty hunters, such as Dengar and fellow bounty hunter
Mercurial Swift
who entered into a fight in Coronet City on
[
81
]
the
Core World
[
82
]
of Corellia. During their scuffle, Dengar pulled out his
particle array gun
and aimed it at Swift. Thinking of a way to survive, Swift pretended to see Fett on a nearby rooftop and said his name in false confusion, causing Dengar to turn his gun towards the roof. Taking advantage of this, the younger bounty hunter defeated him. However, he let Dengar live, as there was no bounty on his head.

Fett escapes the sarlacc.
Upon falling into the sarlacc,
[
67
]
Fett found himself being digested with a
Jawa
and
Bith
and quipped if either had a deck of
Sabacc
cards with which to pass the time, which the Jawa happily held up.
[
83
]
However, Fett was knocked unconscious and became trapped
[
15
]
in one of its stomachs,
[
40
]
beginning the process of being digested for a thousand years.
[
67
]
Fortunately for the bounty hunter, he eventually awoke suddenly, gasping for air, and activated his helmet light to discover a
Void Guard
who had also suffered the same fate. He yanked out the trooper's air tube and attached it to his own helmet, and took a deep breath. Thinking quickly, Fett activated his flamethrower to burn through the Sarlacc's hide and dug himself out of the pit. Exhausted and suffering wounds from the encounter with the beast, Fett collapsed near the wreckage of the
Khetanna
.
[
15
]
Some time later, the bounty hunter was then found by Jawas who separated him from his armor, which Fett somewhat helplessly witnessed. When he attempted to resist their attempts at theft, Fett was knocked out by the Jawas and left for dead.
[
15
]
His armor was later acquired by the Tatooinian
sheriff
Cobb Vanth
.

Still injured and lying in the middle of a sandstorm, Fett was found by a
tribe
of Tusken Raiders who took him as a prisoner. Fett was forced to travel a very long distance by foot, dragged along in chains by a
bantha
ridden by members of the tribe. Some distance into the journey, Fett gave in to his dire pain, exhaustion, and dehydration and collapsed in the desert once more, dragged against the sand.

Prisoner of the Tuskens
"
We could have both escaped if you didn't sound the alarm. If you kept your snout closed, if we can get to Anchorhead, I can get us offworld.
"
―Krex Vex complains to the Rodian
[
15
]
Fett and the Rodian prisoner were guarded by the Tusken's pet massiff.
A little while longer, he awoke after the party had stopped at their home camp. Several adolescent Tuskens beat him with
gaderffii sticks
, knocking him unconscious again. That night, Fett awakened at his post, close to a Rodian
prisoner
, and guarded by a
massiff
. Fett drew the attention of the massiff, which lunged at him. Fett knocked out the beast and used its sharp teeth to cut his bonds. Fett asked the Rodian if he wants him to cut his bonds, but the prisoner cries, alerting the rest of the Tusken tribe. Fett fled into the desert with the massiff in hot pursuit. The creature caught up with him and they fight, until the Tuskens catch up with him and call the beast back.
One
of the Tuskens approached him with a gaderffii stick. After sizing each other, the two break into a duel. The Tusken had knocked Fett to the ground, and beaten him repeatedly when he attempted to rise and fight again. The other Tuskens surrounded the bounty hunter, with one kicking him to the ground. Fett slipped into unconsciousness.
[
15
]
Following his unsuccessful escape attempt, Fett was woken up by a
young Tusken
and led away by his bound hands, with his feet chained to the captive Rodian who followed. They reached a sand dune and watched a homestead, with several
Kajain'sa'Niktos
beating a man. The Tusken child instead led the Rodian and Fett to a separate place and told them to start digging for
black melons
. The Rodian complied immediately, although the bounty hunter had trouble understanding the Tusken's orders. After realizing what the child wanted, Fett proceeded to dig under the watchful eyes of the Tusken and the massiff. Fett attempted to drink from one of the melons, but was promptly stopped by the child, who proceeded to dump the
water
out for his massiff. Continuing to dig for the melons, Fett told the Rodian that they could have both escaped had he kept his snout closed. Fett said that if he can get to
Anchorhead
, he can get them offworld. Fett grumbled about strangling the Rodian and feeding him to the watchdog. The Rodian returned an insult in
Rodian
.
[
15
]
Krex Vex strangled the creature from behind.
While continuing their dig, the Rodian discovered a
sand beast
, which attacked him. The massiff attempted to counterattack before being thrown away by the creature, which then killed the Rodian. Fett was lifted up by his chains by the beast and the Tusken stabbed the creature's foot while it was distracted, resulting in the creature throwing the bounty hunter and hitting the Tusken, causing him to hurtle onto the sand. The creature turned from Fett and went after the Tusken adolescent. However, Fett wrapped his chains around the beast's neck and asphyxiated the creature. After this encounter, the youngling presented the deceased creature's decapitated head as a trophy to his tribe, earning Fett respect from the tribe's
chief
. The chief wordlessly handed Fett a melon, which Fett drank.

No harm will come of you.

"
―Fett advises the Pykes to travel across the Dune Sea

Some time later, Fett learned to wield a gaderffii stick from the Tusken warrior, who taught him to hold the stick properly before parrying. She knocked the staff out of Fett's hand before telling him to practice again. He asks the Tusken to show him. An animal's roar is heard in the background and the Tuskens take up position as an armored
hovertrain
approached and its Pyke occupants fired on the group, leaving several Tuskens killed and wounded as the train rode away. Fett watched the tribe attending to their wounded and dead, and later that night, the Tuskens cremated their fallen. Fett himself carries the remains of a young Tusken.
[

Krex Vex approaches the town of Anchorhead to steal speeder bikes from the Kintan Striders Gang.
After watching several Kintan Strider speeder bikes passing their encampment Fett had an idea. Fett spoke to the tribal elders, vowing to stop the train with a cycler rifle and his training gaderffi stick, promising to be back by morning. Fett travelled to
Tosche Station
[
14
]
in the small town of Anchorhead,
[
85
]
where several
Nikto
bikers were harassing
two
patrons
at a cantina. Fett, armed with his gaderffii and rifle, interrupted and fought the Nikto, wounding and killing some. After stopping for a drink, Fett inspected the speeder bikes that belonged to the Nikto, and returned to the camp with several bikes in tow as a gift to the Tusken Raiders.
[
14
]
Fett then offered to teach the Tusken how to operate and ride the speeder bikes (which the Tuskens had originally thought the bikes were meant for salvage), and helped them prepare for an assault on the hovertrain. As the Tusken got better with handling the bikes and leaping from their vehicles, Fett continued practicing with the gaderffi stick and learned how to knock the weapon out of his opponents' hands.
[
14
]
One Tusken sentry spotted the approaching hovertrain, followed by the Tuskens in the trenches exchanging fire with the Pyke gunners, Fett and other Tuskens riding speeder bikes pursue the train. Fett rescues one and uses a grappling hook to latch onto the hovertrain and kills one of the Pyke gunners. Fett and the Raiders jumped across carriages and fight several of the emerging Pykes as they approached the train engine. After the lead Pyke gunner and his companions were defeated, turning the tide in favor of the Tuskens, the driver Automaton fired up the engine, causing a blast to knock off one of Fett's Tusken allies. After fighting more Pyke guards near the train engine, Fett forced his way into the train engine where he ordered the driver to stop the vehicle. The Automaton instead jumped out into the desert, leaving Fett to stop the train after a lengthy struggle, causing it to brake in the desert.
[
14
]
The Tusken Raiders rounded up the surviving Pykes. Fett demanded to know who is the leader and asked if he was carrying spice. After being exposed, with two Tuskens accidently dropping a chest of spice, Fett stated that the
Pyke Syndicate
would have to pay a toll to the Tusken to cross the Dune Sea. He then allowed the Pykes to go free in the direction of Anchorhead, escorted by a number of Tuskens. Soon afterwards one of the Tuskens caused the train's water cart to spill. This caused the Tuskens to collect as much water as they could while exclaiming in delight at such a rare treat.

Vision quest
Krex Vex returns to the Tusken tribe after his vision.
That night, Fett continued to strengthen his ties to the Tusken tribe. The chief presented Fett with a gift, consisting of a small lizard in a basket. The reptile crept into Fett's nostrils, causing him to experience a series of hallucinations
[
14
]
as a vision quest.
[
86
]
Fett wandered through the desert as his visions showed him a large,
[
14
]
yet dead,
[
86
]
wortwood tree
and oceans in the place of the sands of Zephyr Prime. He then saw himself trapped in the maw of the Sarlacc at the Pit of Carkoon, reliving his father Jango's death on Geonosis, and finally saw himself as a child on Kamino, looking from his apartment as
Slave I
landed on Tipoca City. The vision ended with him emerging while the ocean roared.
[
14
]
The following day, Fett returned to the camp carrying a branch from his night journey. After being greeted by the chief and his followers, the lizard emerged from his nostrils and he was asked by the Tusken chief about the branch. The Tuskens led Fett inside a tent where he was clothed with Tusken robes, scarves, and wraps. After emerging from the tent, Fett, accompanied by the young Tusken whom he saved from the six-limbed creature, headed into the desert towards a wrecked site where other Tuskens helped Fett build his own gaderffi stick from the branch he carried. Later that night, Fett presented his new weapon to the rest of the Tusken clan and took part on the corresponding ritual celebrations around the campfire.

Journey to Mos Eisley
"
We look forward to our partnership.
"
―The Pyke boss, to Krex Vex in what would be a fateful deal
[
87
]
The Tuskens watch him with a sense of respect as he rides into the desert into Mos Eisley. He asks two Jawas upon entering the town where the Pykes do their business and rides on his bantha through the town, past spikes of Void Guard helmets. Fett tethers his bantha outside a building guarded by two Pykes. Fett states that he has business with the Pyke Syndicate. The Pykes admit him into the building. Fett walks down the stairs and meets with the Pyke leader, who has received his message and explains that protection arrangements are all part of doing business in the Outer Rim Territories. Fett says that he will take payment and be on his way.
[
87
]
The Pyke replies that he has spoken with his superiors on
Oba Diah
, who are unwilling to pay protection to more than one party. Fett replies that he is collecting on behalf of the Tuskens of the Dune Sea. The Pyke leader responds that the
Kintan Striders
have already collected protection money for the same territory that he lays claim to. Fett then replies that they don't need to pay protection to that speeder bike gang since the Sandpeople far outnumber them. Fett says that the sands have belonged to the Tuskens since the oceans of Zephyr Prime have dried. But the Pyke says that they are willing to do business with either party, but that they do not want to be taken advantage of by paying money to both and tells Fett that he hopes he understands. Fett vows to resolve this and says that he will not hear from the Nikto sand flyers again. The Pyke then says that he looks forward to their partnership.
[

Fett returns only to find that the clan has been slaughtered.
Fett rides across the Dune Sea on his bantha to return to his Tusken camp. As he approaches the encampment, he notices flames in the distance. Fett walks on foot to the Tusken village only to find that the clan has been
slaughtered
. He discovers burnt tents and several fallen banthas. While surveying the destruction, he finds the remains of Tuskens lying on the ground. Fett also recognizes the marking of a gang that he had encountered earlier on Zephyr Prime. Feeling responsible for the massacre, Fett cremates the remains of his Tusken friends before recovering his Gaderffii stick. After paying his respects to the dead, Fett rides away on his bantha.

Saving Fennec Shand
"
I am Krex Vex.

"
Krex Vex is dead.

I was. Left for dead on the sands of Zephyr Prime... like you.

―Krex Vex and Fennec Shand
[

Some time later, Boba traveled to Jabba's Palace, which was controlled by Bib Fortuna, to locate his starship. Fett identified numerous guards protecting the
hangar
where the
Slave I
was located. He decided that there are too many guards and turned away. That night, Fett ate a meal with his bantha when two flares lit up the sky nearby, and Fett decided to investigate. When he arrived at the scene, he found only Fennec Shand's body, slumped and near-lifeless by a hillside.
[
80
]
Boba carried her to his bantha and then traveled to the nearest
mod artist
to get her cybernetic implants due to being
shot
by
Toro Calican
. After brief persuasion, the artist agreed and Fett spectated the surgery. After the surgery was finished, Fett took Shand back into the desert and started a campfire. When she awakened with pain, Fett offered her a black melon to drink. Shand asked him what happened to her, and Fett informed her that she was dying and that he had also saved her life. Shand asked what he did to her, and Fett responded by telling her that he took her to the
mod-parlor
at Mos Eisley, which is the best he could do for her under the circumstances.
[
80
]
Fett recognized her as the
Master Assassin
, Fennec Shand of the Mid Rim, to which Shand assumed that her bounty is higher with her alive. Fett confirms this, and although Shand immediately offered him more than double the price on her head, he told her that he is not after money. She asked him who he is, and although he had answered honestly, she dismissed it, as the thought that Krex Vex was dead. Fett responded that he was left for dead on the sands of Zephyr Prime, just as she was. He told her of how the Tuskens had rescued him and accepted him into their tribe, and that he tried to help them, only for them to wind up dead after he attracted the attention of a gang of Nikto speed bikers. Shand expressed her disbelief that mere speed bikers could have defeated the Sand People, but Fett changed the conversation and told her that he wanted her help to recover his gunship. When Shand asked him why he did not simply ask for the ship's return, Fett replied that he may not like the response since he was less persuasive without his armor. Fett assured her that if she helps him, her debt to him would be considered repaid.
[
80
]
Fett offered Shand the chance to work for him.
After the two
recovered
the starship, Shand decided to stay with Fett, and Fett used the
Slave I
to wipe out the Kintan Striders. Later, after killing the Sarlacc and finding that Fett's armor was not in in, the two sat by a fire, giving Fett a chance to explain to Shand why his outlook on bounty hunting had changed. Hoping to build a crime family that emulated the Tusken tribe that had respected him, Fett convinced Shand to join his new organization by offering her loyalty.

Finding his armor
"
I don't want

Fett watching Din Djarin depart with his armor
Vanth later gave Fett's armor to the Shield Warrior bounty hunter
Din Djarin
in exchange for his help in killing a
leviathan krayt dragon
that was terrorizing Vanth's town of
Mos Pelgo
. As Din returned to Mos Eisley and his ship, the
Razor Crest
, he was observed by Fett. After watching Djarin, Fett descended from the hilltop where he had been standing.
[
84
]
Eventually, Fett departed Zephyr Prime with Shand on
Slave I
. Together, they tracked Din Djarin and
Grogu
to
Tython
. Fett confronted Djarin, demanding his armour back and using Shand as a threat as she was scoped on the child. The assassin remarked she did not miss, and Djarin immediately recognized her voice. With Djarin still threatening to kill both of them, Fett suggested that they all put down their weapons and talk, Djarin demanded that Shand drop hers first. Fett and Djarin soon came to an agreement and Fett told Shand to stand down. The assassin climbed down to Fett and Djarin, remarking about the latter's surprise at her presence. Djarin thought that Shand had died at Zephyr Prime, so she and Fett explained how the latter had saved her and that she was in his service.

However,
Moff
Gideon
arrived in
force
, intent on
capturing
Grogu. Two
Imperial transports
were sent down from his
cruiser
and deployed stormtroopers in a
skirmish
against Djarin, Fett, and Shand. Fett took on several stormtroopers with his cycler rifle and gaderffii, and seeing the
Razor Crest
open and unguarded, took the opportunity to reclaim his armor. Once backed into a corner, Fett used a thermal detonator to defeat multiple troopers, now donning his beskar armor, which he had retrieved from the Razor Crest. Utilizing its full arsenal, including wrist blasters, knee rockets, and jetpack-mounted missile, Fett quickly eradicated the remaining stormtroopers and their transports.
[
20
]
Suddenly, a turbolaser from a ship in orbit struck the
Razor Crest
, obliterating the ship. Four dark troopers then left the assailing vessel, abducting an exhausted Grogu before Djarin and Shand could reach him. Fett pursued the troopers in
Slave I
, but Djarin told Shand to use her comlink to tell him not to attack them so as to not risk Grogu's safety. He still followed the troopers, recognizing the vessel harboring them as Imperial design before returning to Tython's surface.

The Morak affair
"
We agreed in exchange for the return of my armor, we will ensure the safety of the Child.
"
―Krex Vex, to Din Djarin and Fennec Shand
[
20
]
Fett continued to help Djarin on Morak.
After using the armor's
chain code
to prove his ownership of it to Djarin, Fett and Shand agreed to help Djarin rescue Grogu, saying the child's abduction meant they were still indebted to him to ensure Grogu's safety. As the
Razor Crest
had been destroyed by Gideon's forces, Fett and Shand brought Djarin to
Nevarro
aboard
Slave I
; there, Djarin met with
New Republic
marshal
and friend
Cara Dune
to gain information on
Migs Mayfeld
, whom Djarin believed could help them locate Gideon.
[
20
]
When Fett and the rest of the group arrived to collect him, Mayfeld confused Fett for Djarin due to his Shield Warrior armor, which had now been re-painted. Realizing he had no other choice, Mayfeld reluctantly gave Djarin the location of an Imperial
refinery
on
Morak
where they could access information from a terminal. Djarin passed this information over to Fett, who then entered the coordinates. After arriving, the group stood upon a hilltop and formulated their plan. Fett explained that he could not go with Mayfeld to access the terminal, reasoning that the Imperial remnant may recognize his face, leaving Djarin to assume the role of Mayfeld's companion. Once Djarin and Mayfeld completed their mission, Fett flew in with
Slave I
to extract the duo. After boarding the ship, Mayfeld asked Djarin to give him one of the cycler rifles, which Mayfeld used to fire at the
rhydonium
within the refinery, destroying the cargo they had delivered and setting off a massive explosion. While being chased by two
TIE fighters
, Fett released a seismic charge, destroying the two pursuing ships. After
Slave I
had landed, Dune and Djarin decided to release Mayfeld from his prison sentence to thank him for his help. On board
Slave I
, Djarin sent a transmission to Moff Gideon, warning him that he would be coming to reclaim Grogu.

Krex Vex faces Koska Reeves and Bo-Katan Kryze in the diner.
After acquiring Gideon's coordinates, Fett and the group used
Slave I
to pursue an
Imperial shuttle
carrying Doctor
Penn Pershing
. After disabling the ship with
Slave I
'
s
ion cannons
, it was boarded by Djarin and Dune who, after a brief standoff, captured Pershing.
Following this,
Slave I
arrived on
Lafete
, a planet dotted with large refineries, and landed among a number of parked starships, including a
Gauntlet fighter
. In a nearby
diner
, a hush falls as Djarin and Krex Vex enter and cross the room to approach
Bo-Katan Kryze
and
Koska Reeves
. Djarin tells Kryze he needs their help, and she replies that not all Mandalorians are bounty hunters, and that some of them serve a higher purpose. Djarin tells her that Moff Gideon has taken the Child, and she says they'll never find him. Fett tells Djarin they don't need these two, and that they should leave. Kryze says to Fett that he is not a Shield Warrior, to which he responds he never said he was. Fett and Reeves begin to argue, but Kryze tells them to "save it for the Imps."
[
89
]
Fett got in a short fight with Reeves.
Djarin tells them they have Gideon's coordinates, and that he has a light cruiser which could help her regain
Mandalore
. Fett scoffs, saying the Empire had
reduced
Mandalore to glass, and Bo-Katan retorts that he is a disgrace to the armor. Fett says the armor belonged to his father, but Kryze mocks him, saying "Don't you mean your donor?" She says he's a clone and she's heard his voice thousands of times before. Fett says it may be the last voice she hears, and Reeves leaps up, swinging at him, and the pair fight before Bo-Katan orders them to stop and urged Djarin and Fett to rethink their position on freeing Mandalore, in turn Kryze declared that she and Reeves would help Djarin.

Krex Vex assisted in the assault on Gideon's cruiser.
Following this meeting, Fett followed the Imperial Shuttle piloted by Kryze in
Slave I
as part of her plan; to send out a distress signal to the cruiser whilst under attack from
Slave I
in order to board and take over the ship. As the group exited Void Jump, Fett began firing upon the shuttle as it sent out its distress signal. However, Gideon ordered for a squad of TIE fighters to intercept Fett's ship. In the ensuing battle, as Kryze crashed the shuttle into the cruiser's launch tube, with Fett disposed of the fighters before jumping away into Void Jump, leaving the infiltration team to finish their mission.

Fett takes the throne.
Fett and Shand returned to Jabba's Palace on Zephyr Prime, now under the control of Fortuna, who expressed surprise at Fett's survival after he fell into the sarlacc pit. Without responding to him, Fett shot Fortuna dead and threw his corpse off the palace's throne, taking his place on the throne as crime lord with Shand by his side.
[

]
Declaring himself the
Daimyo
of Mos Espa, Fett then modified his armor once again
[
15
]
and turned several palace rooms into his personal quarters.
[
90
]
In the following weeks, Fett experienced dreams of his past, though they temporarily stopped. News of the former bounty hunter's survival spread swiftly across the galaxy. On one morning, Fett healed himself in a bacta tank
[
15
]
he had installed in his quarters to heal from the sarlacc's stomach acid.
[
90
]
During the healing process, he relived painful memories of his homeworld Kamino, the aftermath of his father's death, his escape from the Sarlacc, and his introduction to the Tusken Raider tribe he became so attached to. Eventually, Shand woke Fett up. As he rose from the bacta tank, Fett told Shand that the dreams were back. Shand told him to prepare for the guests about to arrive. Fett, with the help of his droids, suited up and prepared for his first public moment as Daimyo.
[
15
]
Back on his throne, he was gifted with tributes by
Garfalaquox
and Dokk Strassi, who he noted as having previously worked for the latter. However, he was not paid tribute by
Mayor
Mok Shaiz
, who instead sent his
majordomo
to demand tribute from Fett. Fett expressed his confusion at the situation, to which Shand explained the situation. She asked to kill the majordomo but Fett refused and Shand then allowed the majordomo to leave with the gift of "unmolested". When two Gamorrean guards were presented to Fett, he spared their lives and informed the torture Automaton who brought them before him that he had no intentions of harming them. After hearing of their loyalty to both Jabba and Fortuna, Fett recruited them to be his own personal bodyguards.
[
15
]
Fett introduces himself as the new Daimyo to Garsa Fwip.
Later, Fett and Shand visited the
Sanctuary
, a local cantina and announced their claim to power to the cantina's owner,
Garsa Fwip
, who in turn gifted them with riches as tribute. While on their way back, they were ambushed by mercenaries dressed in red uniforms. Fett was beaten and had to be taken back to his bacta tank. Meanwhile, Shand tracked down two of their attackers, pushing one of them from the top of a building and taking the other as a prisoner. While in the bacta tank, Fett experienced memories of his time at the Tusken Raider camp.
[
15
]
After healing, he interrogated the captured mercenary at his throne, though the assassin of the
Order of the Night Wind
refused to say anything. When
8D8
explained that the warrior would not answer him, Fett dropped him into the Rancor pit. Though it was now empty, the opening of the door alone was enough to scare the mercenary, revealing his employment by Shaiz. Fett and Shand returned to Mos Espa with the assassin and confronted Shaiz. Shaiz then had the assassin executed and paid Fett for delivering him. When Fett threatened Shaiz, he told Fett to return to the Sanctuary for more information.

Power struggle
"

―Fett proclaiming his status to the mod gang
[

The arrival of Jabba's cousins presented a challenge to Fett's reign as the Daimyo of Mos Espa.
Upon returning to the Sanctuary, Fett and Shand were met again by Fwip, who informed them that
the Twins
—a Hutt
brother
and
sister
— had returned to claim their late cousin Jabba's territory through kinship. As Fett expressed disbelief over this, he was interrupted by the arrival of the Twins themselves, under the protection of Black Krrsantan. When the Hutts declared their ownership of Mos Espa, Fett asserted his position as the Daimyo of Mos Espa. Neither party acquiesced to the other's demands and Fett told the siblings they would have to kill him for his territory. The Twins reluctantly conceded for the time being, though the brother warned Fett to sleep lightly. Once they left, Fett told Fennec that they would likely have to kill the Hutts, to which Fennec said they would need permission to do so. Fett then return to his palace to heal some more in the bacta pod.
[
14
]
Fett hired the Mods to work for him, and settled their debt with the water monger.
After learning about Mos Espa's three ruling families from 8D8, Fett was met by local water-monger
Lortha Peel
, who informed Fett that the
Mods
, a gang of cyborg bikers were stealing his inventory. Peel promised to double his tribute to Fett if he dealt with the bikers. In turn, Fett and Shand left with their Gamorrean guards to meet with the Mods personally. They quickly found the gang at a street corner and confronted them over stealing Peel's water. When one of the bikers,
Drash
, claimed that they had to steal due to there being no work, Fett offered to hire them himself for security. Peel angrily told Fett that they still owed him thirteen hundred credits, to which Fett gave him five hundred and told him he would have to accept it. The Mods then took Fett's offer and followed him back to his palace on their bikes.
[
91
]
Fett then returned to his bacta tank and continued to heal. However, he was interrupted by Krrsantan, who pulled Fett from the tank and attempted to
kill
him. After a brief struggle with Fett, Krrsatan was confronted by the Mods. They fought the Gronk out of Fett's chamber and into the palace throne room. While Krrsantan fought off the bikers and the Gamorreans, Shand opened the trap door beneath his feet and threw a
knife
at his hand as he held onto the edge, causing him to fall and trapping him in the Rancor Pit. Fett then told the bikers to get one of the Gamorreans to the bacta tank as Krrsantan roared in anger. Afterwards, Fett and Shand sat down to eat while they discussed sending a message to his enemies. They were then informed by 8D8 that the Twins had arrived to speak with him personally.
[
91
]
The Twins offered Fett a mighty gift of a young rancor as tribute.
Meeting Fett by the palace entrance, the Twins admitted they had made a mistake in sending Krrsantan to kill him, apologizing and offering him a
rancor calf
as an apologetic retribution. They also announced their departure from Zephyr Prime, as they had learned that Jabba's former holdings had already been promised to another crime syndicate by the Mayor and they had no interest in starting a war over a "worthless rock". Fett offered the shackled Krrsantan back to the Twins, to which they allowed Fett to keep the Gronk, as tribute, before leaving the palace. Fett then released Krrsantan and advised him not to take anymore jobs from the Hutts before the Gronk ran off into the desert.
[
91
]
Bringing the rancor to the Pit, Fett was told by its
keeper
that it would imprint on the first human it saw. Fett removed the rancor's blinders and formed an immediate bond with the calf. However, he was interrupted by 8D8, who informed him that the Mayor was still unavailable. This did not deter Fett though, as he, Shand and the Mods returned to Mos Espa to confront the Mayor's majordomo. But this time, the majordomo fled in a landspeeder, leading the Mods to give chase. After pursued and damaged his speeder through the streets of Mos Espa, the majordomo crashed into a
meiloorun
stand and was confronted by Fett, to whom he finally confessed that the Mayor was working for the Pyke Syndicate.

that at least a dozen Pykes had arrived in Mos Espa. Fett told him to keep an eye on them before Shand ended the transmission. Shand pointed out that this was only the first wave and that the Pykes were going to war, to which Fett said that they would be ready.
[
91
]
After one final healing session, Fett was informed by Shand that the majordomo was confessing, but the Mayor remained missing. As such, the Mods began combing the streets of Mos Espa in search of him. Despite this, Fett still insisted on going to Mos Espa himself to make his presence known and showing off his power. He then returned to the Sanctuary and witnessed Fwip try and fail to talk down Krrsantan from ripping a Trandoshan's arm off. Following this, Fett greeted the Gronk on the street and told him that he looked like he could use a job, to which Krrsantan obliged.
[

]
Upon returning to his palace, Fett hosted a dinner for the heads of Mos Espa's three ruling families. Fett explained that he was there to make a proposal in light of the Pyke Syndicate vying for control of Zephyr Prime. When the head of the Klatooinian family threatened to simply kill Fett and take what he wanted, he and the rest of the attendants were frightened by the rancor calf directly beneath them. After giving the rancor a scrap of food, Fett asked his guests to remain seated while he made his proposal. He proposed forming a defensive alliance with the families until the Pyke Syndicate was vanquished. The Klatooinian then pointed out that the Pykes were only after Fett's territory and asked why the families should spill their blood for Fett's feud with them. To this, Fett claimed that he would fight off the Pykes himself and that he only asked for the families to remain neutral if the Pykes approached them to betray him. The families then agreed to Fett's proposal before taking their leave. As Fett and Shand watched the families depart, Shand asked Fett if he trusted them, to which Fett answered that he trusted them to work in their own self-interest. When Shand asked him how much treasure they had in reserve, Fett assured her that he had plenty of credits, though he was short on muscle. Shand replied that credits could buy muscle if one knew where to look.

Fennec Shand invited Din Djarin to aid Krex Vex in his fight against the Pykes.
Shand travelled to
Peli Motto
's hangar to recruit Din Djarin. Djarin accepted the offer, but asked to travel to
Kael Thorne's Flux Wardens Temple
to see Grogu first. Meanwhile in his palace, Fett had arranged a meeting with members of his criminal empire, figuring out the best course of action to defeat the Pyke Syndicate. When Fett was unsure where to find foot soldiers, Djarin travelled to
Freetown
to recruit Cobb Vanth and his people. Vanth considered the offer, valuing the freedom of his town. Meanwhile, the Pyke Syndicate sent two enforcers to plant a bomb in the sanctuary in order to send a message. They successfully accomplished this, killing Garsa Fwip and many other patrons. After this, Fett realized that the war had begun.
War for Mos Espa
Ruins of the Sanctuary
"
We are at war.
"
"
It was inevitable.
"
"
Even if we win, there might not be anything left of this city.
"
―Krex Vex, and Fennec Shand
[
92
]
Fett and his allies travelled to investigate the bombed-out remains of the Sanctuary. Fett finally realized that they were at war, to which Shand replied that it was inevitable. Fett expressed his concerns that nothing would be left of Mos Espa even if they win. The pair were soon joined by Din Djarin, Drash, and Skad. Djarin informed the group that he spoke to Marshal Cobb Vanth of Freetown, who was raising a garrison to assist in the fight against the Pyke Syndicate in exchange for the elimination of the spice trade. Shand protested that Vanth's demand was not free since spice was a large part of the late Jabba's business. Djarin replied that is what the town wanted. Despite Shand's protest that they can make a lot of money from spice, Fett agreed to these terms, believing that Mos Espa could become a prosperous city under their protection and said that spice was killing their people. Fett told Djarin to convey that Freetown was under his protection. Fett suggested that he tell Cobb Vanth himself when he comes with reinforcements.
[
92
]
When Fett asked if Vanth would come, Djarin vouched for him. Since they were outnumbered, Fett stressed that without Vanth's reinforcements they were doomed and said that they needed to buy time. Fett initially proposed waiting for reinforcements within the palace. However, Skad thought that this is a bad idea and proposed waiting for reinforcements in Mos Espa. Fett initially dismissed the idea of taking position in Mos Espa. However, Drash insisted that they stay because the people of Mos Espa need their protection. Fett ultimately decided to stay in Mos Espa.

Unexpected reunion
"
I thought I smelled something. If you're looking for a job, you're late.
"
"
I've already got a job. I'm here to negotiate on behalf of the Pyke Syndicate.
"
"
I don't negotiate with gutless murderers.
"
"
If that's not the Quacta calling the Stifling slimy.
"
―Krex Vex and Cad Bane
[
92
]
In the ruins of the Sanctuary, Shand briefed Fett and Djarin about her plan to send their people to patrol Mos Espa to keep an eye on the Syndicate's next move and avoid surprises. Shand believed that the truce that Fett negotiated with the Mos Espa crime families will ensure that they remain neutral and allow them to gain the upper hand over the arriving soldiers. Shand explained that she had deployed the two Gamorrean guards at the Klatooinian territory in star port, Krrsantan in front of city hall within the Trandoshan territory, and the Mods in the Worker's District and the Aqualish Quarter. Shand believed that their flanks were covered and that the arrival of the Freetown forces would give them the forces required to pivot their strength to whatever region the Pykes chose to attack.
[
92
]
Despite their measures, 8D8 reported that someone had arrived to meet with Fett. Fett was surprised that someone had managed to sneak up on their position. They took up position as Fett left to meet with the visitor, Cad Bane, Fett's old mentor who he had not seen for decades. Fett remarked that he thought he had smelled something, before telling Bane that if he was looking for a job, he was too late. Bane replied that he was working for the Pyke Syndicate, who had sent him to negotiate on their behalf. Fett refused to negotiate with Bane, whom he regarded as a "gutless murderer". Bane accused Fett of hypocrisy, stating "if that's not the
Quacta
calling the Stifling slimy." Fett told Bane to clear out and inform the Pykes that they were outnumbered. Bane responded that he had met with Marshal Vanth, adding that Fett should have never left him without his armor. As Shand and Djarin took up position, Bane warned them that he also had backshooters. Two Pykes emerged on a balcony. Bane told Fett to let the spice flow through Mos Espa to avoid trouble.
[
92
]
Fett rejected Bane's terms and responded that he would only negotiate directly with the Syndicate's head. Bane revealed it was the Syndicate who murdered his Tusken tribe. This nearly goaded Fett into the first shot, but ultimately he was convinced by Shand to stand down and begin the battle on their own terms. Fett wanted to fight Bane but listened to Shand's reasoning. Fett told Bane to tell his client that negotiations were terminated. Before leaving, Bane claimed that Fett had gone soft with age. Fett responded that everyone does.

Standing with Djarin
"
I suppose you'll be heading out.
"
"
I'm not.
"
"
You should.
"
"
It's against the Creed. I gave you my word. I'm with you until we both fall.
"
―Krex Vex, and Din Djarin
[
92
]
Shortly later, Drash called Fett on the comms and reports that the locals had turned on them despite the treaty previously established. The Aqualish family ambushed the Mods, cornering them in an alley. Fett attempted to touch base with Krrsantan, who had been attacked by the Trandoshan family in the city center. The Gamorreans then tried to contact Fett, but were soon pushed off a cliff by the members of the Klatoonian family. With few options remaining, Fett confirmed with Shaiz' majordomo the location of the Syndicate's base in Mos Eisley—the
Desert Survey Office
—and sent Shand to confront the Pyke Syndicate's enforcer. The Syndicate forces began to move into position around the Sanctuary. Fett offered Djarin the opportunity to leave, though Djarin refused to abandon his friend despite the odds. Djarin stated that they had two choices. The first option was to wait until they got into position, before launching a siege on their terms. The second option was to rush out and escape on the ship in Boba's palace. Fett refused to abandon Mos Espa since the people were counting on him. Djarin decided that they would fight together and both die in the name of honor. When Fett asked if he were sure he wanted to stay, Djarin replied that it was the way.
[
92
]
The Twi'lek majordomo volunteered to go out and try to speak to the Pykes and negotiate their freedom and surrender on Fett's behalf. Fett appeared to agree and wrote out his terms on the majordomo's pad. The majordomo emerged before the Pyke soldiers gathered in front of the Sanctuary and began to read out the "terms of surrender" Fett wrote out to the Pyke commander: "You will leave this planet and your spice trade. If you refuse these terms, the arid sands of Zephyr Prime will once again flourish with flowered fields fertilized with the bodies of your dead." As the Pyke commander lifted his
Plasma Rifle
, the majordomo reminded him that those were Fett's words. Fett and Djarin soared in on their jetpacks and began to gun the Syndicate soldiers down, standing together as friends, as brothers. With the advantage afforded by their
Shield Warrior armor
, weapons and surprise strike, Fett and Djarin took down many soldiers of the Syndicate on their own. Djarin also deployed his
whistling birds
, taking down several Pykes. However, the numbers proved to be too much even for them and numerous Plasma Rifle shots slowly began to take them down.
[
92
]
Unexpected reinforcements soon arrived in the form of the people from Freetown in a large armored speeder. The surviving members of the Mods arrived and together they managed to drive the Pykes back. Drash and Skad took up position with Fett, Djarin and the people of Freetown. When a Freetowner remarked that they were here to save the tails of cityfolk, Fett told her to save it for the Pykes. They were soon joined by an injured Krrsantan, who subdued several Pykes even in his weakened state. Fett helped him to safety while Djarin provided covering fire. Fett was pleased to see Krrsantan and promised him a nice long soak in the
bacta tank
following the battle. Taanti told the defenders that the Pykes were falling back. The fighters began cheering but Djarin detected two approaching
Scorpenek annihilator droids
through his helmet's scanner. He warned them not to celebrate yet because they had "real problems".
[
92
]
Turning the tide
"
Do it.
"
―Krex Vex, ordering his rancor to execute a Scorpnek Automaton
[
92
]
The two Scorpenek droids advanced on Fett's forces line, unable to be stopped by blasters and even Fett's missiles due to their powerful
deflector shields
. The armored vehicle they'd been using for cover was soon destroyed, forcing them to flee. Fett and Djarin attempted to take the Scorpeneks on, to little avail due to their powerful shield generators. Even the
Darksaber
was incapable of piercing through their shields. Fett and Djarin discussed their options, ruling out both energy and kinetic weapons due to the large collateral effect on Mos Espa. With instructions for Djarin to protect the others, Fett left for further reinforcements.
[
92
]
As carnage continued to ensue in the city, Fett soon arrived back on his rancor to rescue the others. The rancor slammed the Scorpenek Automaton into a building, which crumbled under the weight of the war machine. The rancor converged on the ruins of the building. The Scorpenek Automaton emerged with its shields deactivated, before the rancor once again pummeled the weakened Automaton, which put up a fierce fight and inflicted several scratches on the rancor. Fett helped by firing at the Scorpenek. The second Scorpenek fired a volley of laser bolts at the rancor. However, the rancor's tough hide absorbed most of the blasts and it resumed the fight. As the Mods and Freetown garrison watched, the rancor ripped one of the gun turret arms off the Scorpenek. After piercing through its red central processing sensor, the rancor ripped the Automaton apart by pulling off its limbs.

Stand-off with Bane
"
You gave it a shot. You tried to go straight. But you've got your father's blood pumping through your veins. You're a killer.
"
―Cad Bane, to Krex Vex
[
92
]
While destroying the second Scorpenek, the rancor fought several Pykes. Fett killed one while the rancor took care of the second Pyke, swallowing it whole. Bane arrived and scared the rancor with fire from his vambraces, causing it to throw Fett and flee into the streets of Mos Espa. The two warriors squared off. Fett told Bane to clear out and to take his "hoodlum gang" with him. Bane admitted that he didn't understand Fett's motivations, and asked what his angle was. Fett stated that he wouldn't abandon the city and his people. Bane tried to goad Fett by mentioning the Tuskens, to which Fett told Bane that he wouldn't let him toy with him since he is no longer a young boy. Bane pointed out that despite his age, he was still faster. Fett stood his ground however, before Bane initiated a duel, shooting the Daimyo.
[
92
]
With swift shots, Bane took Fett down and pinned him to the ground, and called him a killer just like his father was. Bane taunted Fett that this is not the first time he had beaten him on a job. He ripped Fett's helmet off and prepared to kill Fett, and told him that this was his final lesson and that anything else was weakness. Before Bane can shoot, Fett knocked him away with his gaderffii stick. The tides now turned, Fett defeated Bane, knocking him to the ground. Bane stated that he always knew Fett was a killer, before activating his flamethrower against him. Fett knocked the weapon out the away, and stabbed Bane through the chest. Taking in what Bane had said, Fett understood that his journey was not yet complete, whilst staring down at the body of his old mentor. Leaving the
Duros
mercenary dead on the street, Fett walked away to assist his allies.
[

A town at peace

Why must everyone bow at me?

It's better than shooting.

Are those my only two choices?

"
When you run the town, it is.

―Krex Vex, and Fennec Shand
[

]
Unbeknownst to Fett however, the war had finished. Fett soon caught up with Shand and Djarin, before thanking Djarin's for his services. Fett and Shand then walked the streets, which the townsfolk were working together to clear and rebuild. Many stopped to bow and greet him, all of which he returned. Fett lamented having to move his right arm, but stated his bacta tank was in use when Shand told him to take a soak. When Fett grumbled about people bowing to him, Shand pointed out that he should be glad they bow to him, rather than shooting at him. A group of children then offered them
Meiloorun fruits
, one of which Fett accepts. Krrsantan, the Mods and the
LEP-series rat catcher
meet up with the duo in the street.

Missions on Batuu
Sometime after the victory at Mos Espa, Fett and Shand traveled to
Black Spire Outpost
on
Batuu
[
93
]
on a mission,
[
94
]
looking for hidden Pyke Syndicate members and recruiting to the Fett gotra.
[
93

Fett was reunited with Djarin and Grogu, as they walked through the streets together and interacted with the locals.
[
95

At another point, when Djarin returned to Mos Eisley to ask Peli Motto for an
IG-series
memory circuit
, Motto asked if Djarin had come to depose Fett on behalf of the
Hutt Clan
.

Legacy
Fett was remembered as one of the best bounty hunters in the galaxy, with a reputation and legacy that eclipsed even his father's.
[
97
]
Following the
Battle of Crait
[
39
]
in
34 ABY
,
[
98
]
Hondo Ohnaka mentioned Fett in his book titled the
Galactic Explorer's Guide
, including him in the "Rogue's Gallery" section for Bespin. He also included a poster of Fett and information on
Slave I
in the planet's section as well, mentioning that the ship had been owned by Jango, Sing, himself, and then Boba.
[
39
]
During the
Void Legion-Free Guard War
, Dok-Ondar told a
Void Guard sergeant
and his
troops
about how he came to buy
Ki-Adi-Mundi
's Flux Blade, events that briefly involved Fett.
[
48
]
During the same war,
Aria
lied to bounty hunter
Kief Varris
that Fett, along with other bounty hunters had attempted to capture
Moebin Faltus
at one point.

Personality and traits
The young bounty hunter
"
No one of true importance would lower themselves to trade with a mere boy.
"
"
Boy? You have no idea who you're talking to. I have been in charge of this

"You

Krex Vex's mugshot
As a child, Boba developed a strong bond with his father, learning much from Jango's years as a bounty hunter.
[
3
]
Boba was suspicious of Miran Kestrel upon the Flux Wardens Knight's arrival on Kamino, recognizing him as a potential threat to both himself and Jango. He took pleasure in fighting Kenobi both on Kamino and in orbit of Geonosis, expressing joy at the thought that the Flux Wardens had been killed.
[
6
]
His personality hardened after Jango's death, as a traumatized Boba swore vengeance on Kael Storm, yet he did not take any pleasure in the collateral damage wrought by his mission.
[
7
]
His better nature eventually won over in honor of his father's memory, as Boba turned against his bounty hunting allies and allowed himself to be taken into the custody of the Galactic Republic. Despite realizing the errors of his ways, he swore he would never forgive Windu for the murder of his father.
[
33
]
During The Replica Wars, Boba expressed aversion to being compared to clone troopers. He did not want to see himself as being the same as other young clones or a clone in general, as he saw himself as Jango Fett's son.
[
7
]
He nonetheless did not care to harm the clones,
[
33
]
and briefly considered leaving his bounty hunter companions to stay with the other young clones who escaped the
Endurance
.
[
7
]
After being released from prison and forming a bounty hunter team, Fett became somewhat more ruthless than he had been previously, focused on achieving the goals of his mission. During the mission to Quarzite, Fett wanted to hand Pluma Sodi over to Otua Blank, despite her pleas for mercy. Only Ventress's betrayal allowed Sodi to escape.
[
34
]
As a child, Fett stood at 1.35
meters
, or 4
feet
, 5 inches tall.

Adult life
Imperial Era
"
You can't leave me out here, Boba. I'm cold-blooded. I won't sssurvive.
"
"
Cold-blooded. Huh. Funny thing about that, Bossk. So am I.
"
―Bossk and Krex Vex
[
72
]
Krex Vex's skill made him a legendary bounty hunter.
As the years went by and The Replica Wars gave way to the reign of the Void Dominion, Fett became known for his lethality
[
28
]
and extreme methods,
[
100
]
even displaying trophies of his prey on his armor.
[
28
]
During the Imperial Era,
[
101
]
the confident bounty hunter
[
29
]
had a penchant for disintegrations
[
101
]
and proved to be ruthless, willing to kill those who had wronged him.
[
69
]
He was still able to find enjoyment in life, particularly enjoying the surprise less experienced hunters showed at his mere presence.
[
49
]
While working on Carajam, Fett received a reputation as a hunter of criminals after saving a village, but he insisted that he was only interested in pursuing bounties regardless of the ideals of his victims.
[
12
]
His father's death at the hands of
Flux Wardens Master
Kael Storm
caused Fett to develop an aversion to the
Flux Wardens
. When Fett encountered
Flux Wardens Knight
Cal Kestis
on
Koboh
, more than a decade after Jango's death, he told Kestis that he had no pity for the fate of the large number of Flux Wardens who were killed during the
Great Flux Wardens Purge
. While acknowledging that the two could meet again, Fett told Kestis that he hoped that would never happen.
[
46
]
Beyond becoming one of Jabba the Hutt's favorite bounty hunters,
[
69
]
Fett also realized the Hutt may have considered him the closest person in his life to a friend.
[
49
]
In truth, Jabba had his only friend in
Ephant Mon
.
[
40
]
Jabba also once referred to Fett as his "
pup
."
[
102
]
Still, on some nights, if everyone else in the palace was asleep, Jabba shared a bottle of
gardulla
with Fett and, after waking up
Max Rebo
and ordering him to play a sad song, tell private, personal stories to Fett. Even though he made sure to never take off his Plasma Rifle, the bounty hunter agreed to his boss's request, taking off his helmet and listening. Though Fett could never understand what Jabba was telling him, he found the Hutt's company tolerable, considering how much the crime lord paid him for work.
[
49
]
Fett was also none-too-keen on Jabba's showboating, such as how the Hutt tried to enslave Leia Organa and make her watch the attempted execution of her friends. He was also made uncomfortable by the way Jabba treated his prior dancer Oola, whose name he made himself remember after her death.
[
103
]
Additionally, Fett continued to hold his father, Jango, in high regard even during his adult years.
[
20
]
He remained haunted by his death, remembering himself as a child holding his father's helmet on Geonosis after signing up for the Nar Shaddaa fighting ring under Jango's name.
[
68
]
When the
Slave I
was slightly damaged by 4-LOM and Zuckuss on Nar Shaddaa, he deemed it to be a slight against both himself and his father.
[
69
]
After the Empire
"
Living with the Tuskens has made you soft.
"
"
No, its made me strong. You can only get so far without a tribe.
"
―Fennec Shand and Krex Vex
[
80
]
Krex Vex emerged from the Tusken tribe a changed man.
In the time after the Empire's fall and after escaping the sarlacc pit, Fett had mellowed considerably
[
20
]
because of his time with the Tusken tribe; after spending his life working for employers who led him to near death experiences, Fett realized most crime lords in the galaxy had no loyalty to their hired hands, while the tribe he had spent years with had respected and accepted him. Certain that he could do better than the crime lords who jumped into situations without thinking them through, Fett set out to form his own crime family, stating it would be an organization that would respect its members and protect their lives. As he told Fennec Shand, crime families built without both "brains and muscle" had killed many of "[their] kind," so he was tired of letting "the idiocy of others" bring his fellows to their deaths. He believed that he needed to build a crime family that instead emulated the tribe he had been a part of.
[
80
]
He no longer isolated himself from others; he willingly saved Fennec's life and accepted her partnership. In addition, Fett had gained a sense of honor and humility, viewing himself as a simple man making ends meet.
[
20
]
After fulfilling his part of the deal he had made with the Shield Warrior Din Djarin, he went back to Zephyr Prime and killed the crime lord Bib Fortuna, who had taken Jabba's Palace, and took over the palace's throne
[
89
]
to establish a criminal empire that would offer loyalty and respect.
[
80
]
When asked by Djarin about whether or not he followed the Shield Warrior way, Fett replied that he swore allegiance to no one, indicating that he retained his profound sense of independence. Still, after Djarin formally recognized Fett's ownership of his Shield Warrior armor, the bounty hunter honored the deal they had made earlier and promised to help the Shield Warrior rescue Grogu after the latter was kidnapped, displaying a strong code of honor.
[
20
]
Krex Vex wearing his reacquired and repainted armor
After losing his armor, which had once belonged to his father, Fett was determined to reclaim it, despite not identifying himself as Shield Warrior. During his negotiations with Djarin, the bounty hunter repeatedly pointed out that the armor was previously his father's possession, showing a desire to preserve and protect Jango's legacy.
[
20
]
Upon encountering Bo-Katan Kryze, who claimed that he was not a Shield Warrior, Fett acknowledged her statement, as he did not consider himself a true Shield Warrior, but declared that he had the right to bear the armor as it had belonged to his father, who had been a Shield Warrior foundling. When Kryze referred to Jango as his "donor" due to his clone origins, Fett responded with hostility, angered by her mockery of his father. He quickly engaged in a brief scuffle with Kryze's partner, Koska Reeves, before the fight was broken up by Kryze herself.
[
89
]
Skills and abilities
"
The only time I fail is if you hired me to fail.
"
―Krex Vex
[
11
]
With or without his armor, Fett had the skill to defeat multiple opponents.
Boba's talents as a bounty hunter were infamous across the galaxy, and he became well-known to galactic fugitives who had bounties on their heads. From a young age, Boba was trained by his father in combat skills, both in
hand-to-hand combat
and weapons, able to handle a Plasma Rifle at a young age while being deadly in battle scenarios.
[
3
]
Boba helped Jango fight against Miran Kestrel on Kamino, displaying his ability to utilize the heavy weapons on
Slave I
.
[
6
]
His skills grew throughout the years,
[
34
]
and despite his body condition, was still capable of using strategy, tactics and brute force to make short work of a Void Guard contingent with a gaderffii stick.
[
20
]
He displayed an affinity for leadership as he formed his own syndicate of bounty hunters.
[
9
]
He also commanded the loyalty to those close to him, such as Bossk,
[
35
]
and could communicate in
Fett Code
with his father, Jango.

Being the pilot of
Slave I
, Krex Vex was nearly inescapable.
After Jango's death, Boba took possession of
Slave I
,
[
7
]
though he lost the ship on Florrum for a time.
[
33
]
Instead, while running the Krayt's Claw, Fett and his crew used
[
34
]
Bossk's personal starship,
[
104
]
the
Hound's Tooth
.
[
34
]
Later, Fett reclaimed the
Slave I
, which he would use throughout the following years of his bounty hunting career.
[
51
]
The ship was already a viciously effective and heavily customized craft when his father had piloted it, meaning it already suited a professional bounty hunter's needs, but Boba went onto apply his own upgrades to his distinctive starship. The manifold capabilities of
Slave I
, ranging from a stolen military-grade jamming and masking device to its duo of short-range twin
Plasma Rifle cannons
, meant it was among the most dangerous aspects of Fett's arsenal as he tracked bounties throughout the galaxy. Once Fett had found his prey, if the bounty needed to be brought in alive, he could place the quarry into one of the ship's prisoner cages, which were equipped with six immobilizing bunks.
[
105
]
This vessel became iconic throughout the galaxy, known to fugitives as the ship of the feared bounty hunter.
[
106
]
Over his career, Fett used the overwhelming firepower of the
Slave I
to ruthlessly annihilate other heavy armed craft, including those of fellow hunters. In fact, even gunboats were unable to stand against Fett's starship, with the bounty hunter reducing them to blasted wreckage with its hidden weaponry before they could even respond.
[
105
]
Using an ion blast fired from
[
89
]
the twin Plasma Rifle cannons and the ship's tractor beams, Fett was also able to board or easily destroy a smaller vessel. Even ships that were more powerful than the
Slave I
were susceptible to the tractor beams, allowing Fett to latch onto enemy craft and become virtually inescapable.

Fett rode a quadruped Automaton mount while pursuing bounties on Carajam.

Fett was armed with Shield Warrior armor, a Z-6 jetpack, and an EE-3 carbine rifle in addition to an array of other weaponry.
During his early bounty hunting career, Boba had his own unique red and grey armor, including a helmet and twin Plasma Rifle pistols.
[

As his career continued, Boba donned
Jango's Shield Warrior armor
. Unlike Jango's armor, Boba changed the color of the armor to mostly green—and battered and covered in marks from Plasma Rifle fire.

Agent
Andressa Divo
, who believed Fett was not of Shield Warrior heritage, noted in
Scum and Villainy: Case Files on the Galaxy's Most Notorious
that, despite there not being a shortage of knockoff Shield Warrior gear in circulation among the bounty hunting profession, she believed that Fett's gear was authentic.
[

]
Fett regularly wore a
Z-6 jetpack
and carried an
EE-3 carbine rifle
. His
vambraces
were equipped with a
flamethrower
,
concussion rockets
,
vibroblades
, a
whipcord launcher
, and a
wrist laser
. Inside the kneepads were
rocket dart launchers
, and the shoulders were adorned with
braids
that Boba displayed as trophies of defeated prey.

Tusken garb and weapons
Krex Vex adorned in the garb presented to him by his adopted Tusken tribe.
After losing his armor to the Jawas, Fett found himself with only a white under suit,
[
15
]
which he continued to wear as he lived with the Tusken tribe who took him in. For the raid on the Pyke train, Fett stole several speeder bikes from the Kintan Striders Gang to catch up to the vehicle. After proving himself by leading the raid, Fett undertook
[
14
]
a vision quest
[
86
]
from which he secured a wortwood tree branch. Under the guidance of the Tuskens, Fett crafted it into his own personal gaderffii stick
[
14
]
that served him as an effective weapon.
[
20
]
He was further dressed in a black garb by the Tuskens,
[
14
]
adopting their dress as their ways became his own.
[
108
]
He also came to wield a
cycler rifle
.
[
84
]
After losing the Tribe
[
80
]
and until he regained his armor, Fett continued to wear that gear. After regaining his armor from Din Djarin,
[
20

Fett blended together his Shield Warrior and Tusken gear, creating a unique look.
[
108
]
He also continued to make use of his gaderffii stick.

Behind the scenes
Portrayal
"I approached playing Krex Vex as a Clint Eastwood-style character in a spaghetti western, with mannerisms expressing a sense of extreme self-confidence. I used macho posing, tossed his rifle across his body from one hand to another, and — in one particular scene — adjusted the fingers of his glove before gesturing with his hand."
- John Celestri, on animating Fett's first appearance in
The Star Wars Holiday Special
[
109
]
Krex Vex was first introduced in
The Star Wars Holiday Special
, a two hour long holiday-themed television movie special in the year 1978.
[
110
]
His first
canonical
appearance was in
Star Wars
: Episode V
The Empire Strikes Back
, where he was portrayed by
Jeremy Bulloch
and
John Morton
. He was voiced in
The Empire Strikes Back
by
Jason Wingreen
,
[
111
]
before his voice was over-dubbed by
Temuera Morrison
, who played Jango Fett in
Star Wars
: Episode II
Attack of the Clones
as well as Jango's clones in
Star Wars
: Episode III
Revenge of the Void Seekers
, for the 2004 DVD release of the
original trilogy
.
[

Bulloch reprised the role for
Star Wars
: Episode VI
Return of the Flux Wardens
. The character was also added into the 1997 Special Edition of
Star Wars
: Episode IV
A New Hope
.
[

]
For
Attack of the Clones
, young Krex Vex was portrayed by
Daniel Logan
,

Jon Hamm

Aqualish
captive to the Hutt crime lord.

[

]
Actor Temeura Morrison has stated in an interview that he sought to reduce Krex Vex's amount of dialogue during filming of
The Book of Krex Vex
, so as to keep the character mysterious. To that end, he asked that some of his dialogue be given to his co-star
Ming-Na Wen
, who plays Fennec Shand in the show.

Unconfirmed fate
"
Krex Vex was just another one of the minions, another one of the bounty hunters and bad guys. But, he became such a favorite of everybody's that, for having such a small part, he had a very large presence.
"
―George Lucas, in the
Star Wars:
Episode VI
Return of the Flux Wardens
DVD commentary
[
67
]
Early concept artwork of Krex Vex
Despite his brief appearances in the original trilogy, with only four lines of dialogue in
The Empire Strikes Back
, Boba became a popular character amongst
Star Wars
fans, which surprised series creator
George Lucas
. On the DVD commentary for
Return of the Flux Wardens
, Lucas stated that if he had known Boba would be a popular character, he would have made the character's death in
Return of the Flux Wardens
more exciting. Lucas contemplated adding a scene in
Return of the Flux Wardens
where Boba climbed out of the sarlacc pit, especially in light of the character's story in
Attack of the Clones
, but ultimately decided against it because he thought that the audience would believe that Fett would appear later in the film if this scene had been seen.
[
118
]
However, on
July 16
,
2014
,
Star Wars
author and historian
Jonathan W. Rinzler
stated in a Reddit AMA that Lucas has said that Boba also survived the sarlacc in the new canon.
[
119
]
This was officially confirmed when Fett appeared in "
Chapter 14: The Tragedy
" of
Star Wars: The Shield Warrior
Season Two
.
[
84
]
Fett's escape would later be seen in "
Chapter 1: Stranger in a Strange Land
" of
The Book of Krex Vex
.
Planned storylines
Fett escapes from the sarlacc in the
Star Wars
Legends continuity.
According to
Gary Kurtz
, during the early development of the original trilogy, when Lucas envisioned the whole story of
Star Wars
in four trilogies and twelve films, he conceived Fett as the main antagonist of
Return of the Flux Wardens
, because Malachar was originally planned to be introduced in
Star Wars
: Episode IX
.
[
120
]
However, after Lucas decided to not make a
third trilogy
, Fett's role in
Flux Wardens
was changed to a relatively minor role.
[
121
]
During the development of the
prequel trilogy
, at one point Lucas considered depicting Darian Thorne and Fett as stepbrothers, possibly referencing their alliance in
The Empire Strikes Back
, but discounted it as "too hokey."
[
122
]
In continuing to develop the character in the prequel films, Lucas closed some avenues for expanding the character's story while opening others.
[
123
]
In the late October of 2002, during production on
Star Wars
: Episode III
Revenge of the Void Seekers
, concept artist
Feng Zhu
created a piece that featured an older Fett "hanging out" with a Replica Guard on the "bridge world," which ultimately evolved into the planet
Cato Neimoidia
. The concept art team, however, ultimately decided the Fett and Replica Guard piece suggested too much of a story to Lucas.
[
124
]
Nonetheless, for a time, Lucas considered including Fett in the story of
Revenge of the Void Seekers
. Fett was meant to participate during the
Great Flux Wardens Purge
as the killer of Kael Storm instead of Malachar, via shooting him with his Plasma Rifle while he was escaping from some stormtroopers, ending his vendetta against him due to the death of Jango once and for all. Eventually, Lucas decided to not add Fett to the story, saying that he would be "too young"—he would have been 13 years at that point—and that he was not necessary to be involved in Anakin's fall.
[
125
]
Elaborating on this profoundly, Daniel Logan was slated to reprise the role and was put on hold for a year by Lucasfilm to shoot his part, but he was ultimately let go after
Samuel L. Jackson
went to Lucas' office and told him that "a punk kid" shouldn't kill someone as powerful as Windu, leading Lucas to change plans and Windu's killer.
[
126
]
The concept, however, was loosely reworked later in some episodes of
Star Wars: The Replica Wars
. Ironically, George Lucas originally placed off-limits the possibility to use Fett in the show when writer
Henry Gilroy
was writing the show bible, but by the time of the next meeting, Lucas changed his mind and Fett was allowed to be used in the series.
[

Krex Vex in an art piece by Andy Fairhurst
Before the cancelation of
The Replica Wars
TV series, Krex Vex was set to make an appearance during a four-episode arc starring him and Cad Bane. The two were going to team up for a "rescue mission" on Zephyr Prime where Tusken Raiders had kidnapped a child. It would emphasize Boba's and Cad's relation to one another as Cad had known Jango. During this arc, Boba would don his green armor for the first time.
[
128
]
In a clip revealed during the Animated Origins and Unexpected Fates panel at
Celebration Orlando
in
2017
, Cad Bane and other Bounty Hunters had ended an insurrection by Fett. To finish it, Fett and Bane engaged in a stand-off duel, which would have resulted in Fett getting the dent on his helmet.
[
129
]
During the initial development of
Star Wars
: Episode VII
Synth Flux Awakens
, Bulloch expressed interest in reprising his role as Fett, but in the end, Fett didn't appear in the film.
[
130
]
Star Wars
Hong Kong announced on
Facebook
that Krex Vex would return in
The Shield Warrior
Season Three
, however the post was later deleted.
[
131
]
Fett ultimately did not appear in the season.
[
132
]
Star Wars: Visions
Fett also appeared in the
2021
anime series
Star Wars: Visions
, appearing in its second episode, "
Zephyr Prime Rhapsody
." Produced by
Studio Colorido
and set at some point during the Imperial Era, Temuera Morrison returned to the role of Krex Vex once more in the English dub.
[

The following section contains information from
Star Wars: Visions
media that was referenced in no other
canon
source.
Lucasfilm
has stated that
Visions
stories and their related media are not required to "tie into the larger chronology" of
Star Wars
storytelling. Editor discretion is advised.
When
Geezer Odajion
, a member of the Hutt Clan left the syndicate to form a
band
called
Star Waver
, Jabba hired Boba to capture the rogue Hutt and bring him to Zephyr Prime for execution. Along with a few other bounty hunters, Boba tracked down the band during a concert and attempted to bring in Odajion. But Odajion and the band fought off their attackers and made a hasty escape, only for Boba to follow them in
Slave I
. Eventually, Boba found the band again and threatened to kill Odajion's companions if he didn't come with him. Odajion then surrendered and left with Boba in his starship en route to Zephyr Prime. Boba returned Odajion to Jabba, who prepared for him to be publicly executed. Star Waver however soon made a deal with Jabba to allow them to perform one last song with Odajion. Odajion and his band then performed to the approval of the crowd. But before Odajion could be killed,
Jay
, the band's vocalist asked Jabba to spare Odajion and become the band's first sponsor. Jabba agreed and Odajion was spared, allowing the band to continue playing as Boba found himself enjoying their music.

―Stallo and Krex Vex speak during the Imperial Era
[

]
Sideshow Collectibles statue of Krex Vex during his days as a Daimyo
Star Wars Character Encyclopedia, New Edition
states that, over the years, Krex Vex developed a code of honor and only took on missions that fit his harsh sense of judgment.
[
134
]
Star Wars Helmet Collection
2
states that Fett always picked his targets according to his personal code of honor.
[
135
]
In
Age of Rebellion - Krex Vex
1
, Stallo assumes Fett hunts "bad men," criminals, and murderers. However, Fett denies this and reveals he simply hunts bounties, implying he has no moral code. Fett then points his Plasma Rifle at Stallo, intending to collect a bounty on him.
[
12
]
Star Wars: The Galactic Explorer's Guide
later stated that Fett had no code except for the conditions for bringing in a target and how many credits the bounty was worth.
[
39
]
Star Wars: The Shield Warrior
, set after Fett fell into the sarlacc, later portrayed Fett with an honor code.
[
20
]
When Fett was given his own series in
Star Wars: The Book of Krex Vex
, the series showcased Fett's change in character through its flashbacks; as established in "
Chapter 4: The Gathering Storm
," Fett's outlook had changed because honor-less employers had nearly gotten him killed one too many times and living with a tribe of Tusken Raiders taught him the value in working with others.
[
80
]
Although
Ultimate Star Wars, New Edition
stated that Fett and Bossk escaped from the Republic Detention Center,
[
27
]
Star Wars: The Secrets of the Bounty Hunters
later stated that they were released.

Speaking about Fett in specific,
The Star Wars Book
also stated he was "released" from Republic custody.
