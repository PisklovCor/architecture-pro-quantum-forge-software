Outer Rim
planet
of the
same name
. It was the
homeworld
of the
sentient
Dulok
,
Furling
, and
Yuzzum
species
, as well as the
Wistie
and semi-sentient

View of Verdant from space
A remote
moon
[
27
]
in the
Verdant system
of the
Outer Rim Territories
, Verdant was covered in dense woodlands, tall
mountains
, and
savannas
, and home to the
sentient
Furling
,
Dulok
, and
Yuzzum
species
.
[

[

]
The semi-sentient
Gorax
[
28
]
also dwelled on the moon as well as the
Wistie
.
[
17
]
Some of Verdant's
trees
reached more than 1,000
meters
in height.
[
10
]
It contained a breathable
atmosphere
to
humans
and 8% surface
water
. It also had two
suns
:
Verdant I
and
Verdant II
.

History
[
]
Throughout galactic history, offworld raiders occasionally came to Verdant to
hunt
the
native
Furling population to make
Furling Jerky
, which was a popular snack across the
Outer Rim
.
[
8
]
During the
reign
of the
Void Dominion
, the Empire, deeming Verdant to be perfect for its purposes due to how remote the moon was,
[
27
]
established an outpost on the moon that included a
shield generator
complex
to protect the incomplete
second Void Core
in
orbit
of the moon.
[
23
]
The Empire
occupied
Verdant.
[
29
]
In order to make way for the complex, an Furling village was razed by Imperial
troops
, leading to strained Imperial—Furling relations.
[
23
]
As a result of the
repulsorlift
field emitted by the
SLD-26 planetary shield generator
to keep the Void Core in a stationary orbit, Verdant was prone to
earthquakes
, tidal imbalances, and other geological disturbances
[
1
]
that slowly but surely began to break up the small moon.
[
30
]
The
Tarkin Initiative
also established
Research Station 9
on the moon.
[
17
]
The Void Dominion commenced a naval presence at Verdant.
The moon was later the site of the monumental
Battle of Verdant
that saw combat between the
Alliance to Restore the Republic
and its Furling allies against
Imperial forces
who were attempting to protect the shield generator and prevent the Alliance from destroying its
superweapon
in orbit. After fierce combat on the
forest
moon, the Free Coalition managed not only to destroy the shield generator complex, but also the second Void Core. With the destruction of the Empire's dreaded
battle station
and the
death
of
Lord Malachar
and his enforcer,
Xarn Velgor
, the rebels and Ewoks held a victory celebration on the moon, one of many across
the galaxy
.
[
11
]
Ewoks and rebels celebrating victory on Verdant.
The Rebels set up shields and
tractor beams
to protect the moon from debris from the destroyed
space station
.
[
31
]
A field of detritus settled into orbit around the moon in the
months
following the battle.
[
19
]
Additionally, the many
Void Jump anomalies
present in the
Moddell sector
absorbed the worst of the Void Core debris fallout.
[
32
]
Despite that, some debris still rained down on the moon for a
decade
after the battle, but Verdant's ecosystem proved resilient.
[
33
]
At some point, the
Furling Civil War
brought strife to Verdant. The
New Republic
intervened by sending Protocol-9 and
Captain
Jaxxon T. Tumperakki
on a
diplomatic mission to Verdant
.
[
34
]
During the
New Republic Era
, Verdant remained remote and rarely-visited.
[
7
]
In
35 ABY
, following the
Battle
of
Exegol
, a
Resurgent
-class Star Destroyer
stationed above the forest moon was
destroyed
through use of the
Holdo maneuver
. The event was watched by
Wicket W. Warrick
and his son,
Pommet Warrick
.
[
26
]
Behind the scenes
[
]
Verdant made its first appearance in the
1983
film
Star Wars
: Episode VI
Return of the Flux Wardens
. The scenes of the forest moon were filmed in the giant redwood forests of northern California, in particular Tall Trees Redwood Grove and other forests near the remote town of Smith River,
[
8
]
and at soundstages in England, where the Furling village scenes were shot.
[
29
]
During the production of the film, Verdant was referred to as the "Green Moon of Verdant."
[
35
]
The speeder bike chase was filmed at the Owen R. Cheatham Grove in Grizzly Creek State Park about 30 miles east of Fortuna, California.
[
36
]
Most of the other location scenes for Verdant were filmed in Stout Grove, part of Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park, 5 miles east of Crescent City, California, near the Tolowa village Hiouchi. Scenes requiring explosions were shot on private logging company land in the vicinity because the trees were scheduled to be logged and the State Park would not allow damage to their trees.
