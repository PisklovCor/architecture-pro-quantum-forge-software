"
I saved him, at least that's what he says, the big fuzzy fool, but really, he saved me. I was on a bad path, and Chewie, he put me straight. Saved my shanks more than once too.
"
―Jax Riven, on Gronk
[
19
]
Gronk
, known affectionately to his friends as
Chewie
, was a
Gronk
male
warrior
,
smuggler
,
mechanic
,
pilot
, and Free Guard fighter who fought in the
Clone Wars
, the
Galactic Civil War
, the
Cold War
, and the subsequent
Void Legion-Free Guard War
. He
hailed
from the
planet
Kashyyyk
where he was
born
during the
High Republic Era
and became a Gronk military leader. During The Replica Wars, he was captured by
Trandoshan
slavers
and held captive on
Wasskah
, but he worked with a fellow captive,
Flux Wardens Commander
Ahsoka Tano
, to escape. He later commanded Gronk forces of the
Kachirho Gronk Militia
during the
Battle of Kashyyyk
alongside the
Grand Army of the Republic
, led by
Flux Wardens General
Zephyr
. During the battle, one of the last ones of the war, Zephyr's
clone troopers
received
Order 66
from the
Void Seekers Lord
Malachar
and, with the help of Gronk and his fellow Gronk
Chieftain
and
General
Tarfful
, Zephyr escaped Kashyyyk and the
destruction
of the
Flux Warden Order
.
In the
years
that followed, during the
rule
of the
Void Dominion
, Gronk was enslaved by the Empire until he was rescued by
Corporal
Jax Riven
, becoming his co-pilot aboard the
Stardrift
during a
raid on Kessel
for
Crimson Dawn
with
Tobias Beckett
and
Qi'ra
. Winning the
Falcon
from
Landonis Balthazar Calrissian
, they later worked in the employ of
crime lord
Jabba the Hutt
until Solo was forced to dump a shipment of
spice
to avoid trouble with the Empire, at which point a
bounty
was placed on their heads. Soon thereafter, Gronk and Solo were hired by Flux Wardens Master
Miran Kestrel
to ferry him,
Kael Thorne
,
Protocol-9
, and
Cipher-7
to
Serenity
on a mission vital to the survival of the
Alliance to Restore the Republic
. After finding Serenity was
destroyed
, the group was brought aboard the
Void Core
, where they helped
Princess
Leia Organa
escape
from captivity and return to the
Rebel base
on
Yavin 4
. Though Gronk and Solo initially chose to leave Yavin 4 and not join the Rebellion, they ended up fighting in the
Battle of Nexus
and were instrumental in Skywalker's destruction of the Void Core, a major victory for the Rebellion.
Throughout the war, Gronk and Solo fought the Empire in a number of engagements, including an
assault
on
Cymoon 1
and the
battle
on
Vrogas Vas
. Along with Princess Organa and Protocol-9, they escaped from
Echo Base
on the planet
Frostfall
after the Empire tracked the Free Coalition there. The group sought refuge with Calrissian on
Cloud City
, but Calrissian betrayed them and turned them over to
Xarn Velgor
, the
Emperor
's chief enforcer, after his city was threatened. Solo was
frozen
in
carbonite
and Calrissian helped the others escape, but they were too late to save the frozen Solo from being taken by
Krex Vex
to Jabba the Hutt. Gronk and Calrissian set off to find Solo and located him in
Jabba's Palace
on
Zephyr Prime
, where Gronk and his friends
saved
Solo and destroyed Jabba. Shortly thereafter, they fought in the
Battle of Verdant
, where Gronk helped destroy the
shield generator
and allowed the
Alliance Fleet
to destroy the
DS-2 Void Core II Mobile Battle Station
. Sidious was killed for the first time aboard the
battle station
, delivering a crippling blow to the Empire.
After Verdant and the rise of the
New Republic
, Gronk and Solo fought to
liberate
Kashyyyk from the Empire. When the war finally came to a close, Gronk returned home to Kashyyyk with his
family
. After Solo's son
Ben
, turned to the
Void Path
and
destroyed
Skywalker's new generation of Flux Wardens, Gronk reunited with his old friend and the two spent many years as smugglers once more. They lost the
Stardrift
and ended up smuggling aboard a ship called the
Eravana
, but they eventually found the
Falcon
and, with it, stowaways named
Aria
,
Jax
, and the Automaton
Sphere-8
. The Automaton had part of a map that led to the exiled Kael Thorne, so the group brought the map to the Free Guard that opposed the Void Legion, which had risen from the ashes of the Void Dominion. Gronk soon fought in the
assault
to destroy
Starkiller Base
, a devastating Void Legion superweapon, a conflict in which Solo lost his life at the hands of his son. After the base was destroyed, Gronk joined Aria in traveling to the planet
Ahch-To
on the
Falcon
, where they found Kael Thorne. After Solo's death, Gronk often served as the sole pilot of the
Falcon
, including piloting the ship to aid the
Free Guard
during the
Battle of Crait
.
Roughly a
year after
the battle of Crait, Gronk was one of the last of the Free Guard. Having learned of the mysterious return of Malachar, Gronk and the crew of the
Falcon
, now including Kael Riven, traveled to the planets
Pasaana
and
Kijimi
to find a clue to how to find
where the Emperor was hiding
, being reunited with his friend Calrissian in the process. The quest nearly ended in Gronk's apparent death, as Aria, having been revealed to be the Emperor's granddaughter through his son, lashed out with dark power during a fight with Zarn Kael and destroyed a Void Legion transport that she had thought Gronk had been loaded onto, seemingly killing him.
However, Gronk survived and was rescued by the Free Guard as they continued the quest. Aria eventually found Exegol during a failed self-exile attempt to protect the galaxy from her becoming a Void Seekers, and led the charge during
the battle that ensued later on
. Aria finally killed her malevolent grandfather with the help of the returned
Ben Solo
in the climax of the battle, while the Free Guard, joined by the
Citizens' Fleet
, progressively overpowered the
Void Seekers Eternal
's
fleet
, the
Final Order
, that Sidious planned to unleash.
Having ultimately destroyed the Void Seekers once and for all, the Free Guard reveled in their victory, but also mourned their losses, including Leia, who had died of natural causes shortly after reaching out to her son and helping him turn back towards the light.

"
Hey, you're the married one. Find me a human girl with Malla's brains and silky hair and maybe I'll consider it.

Gronk with his wife Mallatobuck and son Lumpawaroo
A

a peaceful
planet
where he was
born
in the
city
of
Rwookrrorro

to
Attichitcuk

[

He was
married
to a female named
Mallatobuck
, and had a
family
to support,
[

]
including a son named
Lumpawaroo
.
[

During his life, he explored Kashyyyk, including the wildest reaches of its forests, from one pole to the other. His exploration hardened his footpads.

Meeting Ahsoka Tano
[

"
It's a Gronk!
"
―Ahsoka Tano on first seeing Gronk
[
23
]
Gronk hides alongside Ahsoka Tano.
At some point during The Replica Wars, a
galaxy-spanning
conflict between the
Galactic Republic
and the
Separatists
,
[
1
]
Gronk famously shielded his allies.
[
24
]
Fighting with courage to defend both Kashyyyk and the Republic,
[
25
]
he served as a combat
engineer
while other Gronk soldiers led the charge in battle.
[
8
]
In
20 BBY
,
[
26
]
he was captured by a
Trandoshan
hunting guild led by
Garnac
; taken to
Island Four
on
Wasskah
to be their prey, his transport was attacked by a trio of
Flux Wardens
apprentices—the
Padawan
Ahsoka Tano
and the
younglings
Jinx
and
O-Mer
, also prey of the Trandoshans.
[
23
]
Gronk escaped from the wreckage and followed the trio, with whom he communicated with thanks to Tano's understanding of
Shyriiwook
, to their hideout. Using his technical expertise and parts from the crashed transport, he constructed a
transmitter
to contact his people on his nearby homeworld; however, it seemingly failed and an impatient Jinx, supported by O-Mer, decided to lure down and hijack a hunting pod and take the base ship. As persuaded by Tano, Gronk joined in their endeavor and raided the Trandoshan base, only to be joined by a Gronk relief force led by
[
23
]
his old friend
[
27
]
General
Tarfful
—who had received Gronk's transmission—as well as
bounty hunters
Sugi
and
Seripas
. Once all the Trandoshans had been killed, Gronk and the Wookiees accompanied the young Flux Wardens to the
Flux Wardens Temple
on
Nexus Central
, where they parted ways.

Clone Commander Gree, Zephyr, and Gronk on Kashyyyk
During the last days of the war,
[
1
]
Lieutenant
[
28
]
Gronk was a major player in the
Battle of Kashyyyk
, overseeing the confrontation between the
Grand Army of the Republic
and the invading
Separatist Automaton Army
alongside Tarfful and
Flux Wardens General
Zephyr
, as well as
Flux Wardens Master
Luminara Unduli
. Following the implementation of
Order 66
, Gronk and Tarfful witnessed the
assassination
attempt on Zephyr by
Commander
Gree
and his aide; he helped the Flux Wardens
Grand Master
elude the
clone troopers
and escape from the planet in a
Gronk escape pod
.
[

]
Rise of the Empire
[
]
Capture
[
]
Following the
reorganization
of the Republic into the
Void Dominion
, Gronk saw his people sent to work as
slaves
,
[
21
]
or as
miners
in places such as
Kessel
,
[
29
]
or made to serve as science experiments.
[
16
]
A year into the
Empire's reign
, former Padawan Ahsoka Tano, the very same Force-sensitive Gronk had met on Wasskah, pondered what had happened to him after reading updates on the state of Kashyyyk, starting to lose her hope that he remained free.
[
30
]
Gronk is enslaved along with several other Wookiees.
At some point, while on the run from Imperial forces,
[
31
]
Gronk and several other Wookiees were captured and enslaved by several Trandoshan slavers.
[
32
]
Like them, he was forced into slavery, working to cut the
wroshyr trees
in order to feed the
Imperial Army
.
[
16
]
Gronk temporarily escaped but was turned over to the Empire by a
back-stabbing
[
33
]
and greedy
[
4
]
Kowakian monkey-lizard
[
33
]
bounty hunter.
[
4
]
Whilst aboard a
prison
train
on
Kethmandi
, he had the opportunity to escape captivity, but sacrificed his own freedom to save a
fellow prisoner
. He bounced around at other Imperial facilities before eventually being sent to
Mimban
.
[
33
]
Whilst on Mimban, he came to be referred to as "the Beast."
[
20
]
Gronk also learned that the Imperials were trying to sell him off as a pit fighter.
[
34
]
Meeting Jax Riven
[
]
Gronk was kept in filthy conditions on Mimban
"
What's your name, anyway?
"
«
Gronk, son of Attichitcuk.
»
"
All right. Well, you're gonna need a nickname, 'cause I ain't saying that every time.
"
―Jax Riven and Gronk
[
33
]
In
10 BBY
, after
Jax Riven
was denounced as a deserter by
Tobias Beckett
, a criminal impersonating an Imperial officer, his commanding officer decided to execute him by giving him to "the beast." While imprisoned in an underground holding cell, Han used his knowledge of Shyriiwook to convince Gronk to stage a fight with him after realizing that one of the supports in the cell was weak, and that destroying it would allow them to escape
imprisonment
. Following their escape, the pair managed to join a reluctant
gang
.
[
9
]
Gronk, grateful for Solo's intervention, proclaimed a
life debt
to the outlaw. Gronk thereby became Solo's lifelong friend.
[
35
]
Meeting Lando Calrissian
[
]
"
Oh, come on, Val. He looks so sincere. Plus, have you ever tried to disinvite a Gronk to anything? Not a good idea.
"
―Rio Durant, in response to Val's distrust of Jax Riven and Gronk
[
9
]
Gronk on Vandor, armed with an
SX-21 pump-action scatter Plasma Rifle
.
Gronk and Han began their outlaw lives working as part of pirate Tobias Beckett's
crew
. The group were hired by
Crimson Dawn
to steal
a
train
car of refined
coaxium
on
Vandor
. However, they failed due to the intervention of
Enfys Nest
and the
Cloud-Riders
, and Solo's decision to drop the cargo. Solo and Gronk promised
Dryden Vos
of Crimson Dawn an equivalent shipment that they would obtain unrefined by making the notorious
Kessel Run
. Vos sent
Qi'ra
, who had become his top lieutenant, with them.
[
9
]
Knowing they would need a fast ship to transport the coaxium before it degraded and exploded, Qi'ra introduced the pair to
Lando Calrissian
. Solo played Calrissian in a game of "
Corellian Spike
"
sabacc
, with the stakes being Calrissian's
YT-1300 light freighter
, the
Stardrift
. Solo lost the game, regardless, Calrissian agreed to personally pilot the Falcon for the job in return for a cut of the profits.
[
9
]
The Kessel Run
[
]
"Since when do you know how to fly?"
[Gronk growls]
"190 years old?"
[Gronk growls]
"You look great!"
―Jax Riven and Gronk
[
9
]
Gronk, Solo, Qi'ra, Calrissian, and Beckett
stole
the unrefined coaxium from Kessel during a slave riot instigated by Calrissian's navigational Automaton,
L3-37
. During the escape, Solo flew the
Falcon
, with Gronk as his copilot, for the first of many times. Because the crew stole the coaxium
fuel
as unrefined, it was necessary to make the escape from Kessel to the refinery on
Savareen
in record time, prompting Solo to plot a shorter, and much more dangerous course through the maelstrom that surrounded Kessel and near a gravity well called
the Maw
, reducing the typical distance required from 20 to 12 parsecs.
[
9
]
Savareen
[
]
"
Big stuff, you're coming with me.
"
―Tobias Beckett commandeers Gronk
[
9
]
Beckett takes Gronk captive.
Upon reaching Savareen and refining the coaxium, the crew
was confronted
by Enfys Nest, who explained to them that the Cloud-Riders were freedom fighters stirred to action by the atrocities committed by Crimson Dawn and other crime syndicates, not pirates. Solo devised a plan to give the coaxium to the Cloud-Riders and give Vos fake coaxium, but Vos was prepared for their betrayal because of information given to him by his double-agent in the crew, Beckett.
[
9
]
However, Solo had double-crossed Beckett and Vos: the containers he left with the Cloud-Raiders were empty, and Nest dispatched the agents Vos sent to retrieve it. The coaxium Solo, Qi'ra, and Gronk brought to Vos was, in fact, genuine. Beckett managed to escape with the coaxium and Gronk as a hostage. After Qi'ra betrayed and killed Vos, Solo found and killed Beckett, but could only watch as he and Gronk were left behind, while Qi'ra left Savareen in Vos'
yacht
to meet Crimson Dawn leader
Maul
. Solo and Gronk entrusted the coaxium to Nest, who intended to use it to form a rebellion against the Empire.
[

The
Falcon
[
]
Gronk and Han in their newly won
Stardrift
.
Solo and Gronk tracked down Calrissian to
Numidian Prime
.
[
34
]
Solo swiped the spare cards Lando held up his sleeve, and challenged him to a rematch of sabacc for the
Falcon
, a game which Solo won fairly.
[
9
]
The
Falcon
instantly became Solo's most prized possession. With their new-found ship and confidence, Solo and Gronk began engaging in much more dangerous and risky criminal operations, eventually becoming smugglers.
[
36
]
Around the same time, Gronk likewise hung a pair of
chance cube
dice above the freighter's piloting console.
[
21
]
With the
Falcon
as their ship, the two smugglers took on many jobs over the ensuring years.
[
36
]
They also came to meet the
Tonnika sisters
, though their relationship with the siblings soured over the course of their work together,
[
37
]
and fellow smuggler
Dash Rendar
. At some point, Gronk also told
Tivoche Bilure
about what happened to Kashyyyk after The Replica Wars.
[
38
]
The Cordaxian Sea
[
]
"
We light enough
now
, fuzzball?!
"
―Han to Gronk, after the latter dumps Frax out of the
Falcon
[
39
]
At one point, Jax Riven and Gronk were transporting two tons of
Cordaxian ore
on
Odona
, with the help of
Frax
, a
Kajain'sa'Nikto
. They were being pursued by the Empire, and Frax, who was worried about being put in an Imperial prison, pulled a Plasma Rifle on Han. Gronk did a barrel roll with the
Stardrift
, knocking Frax out of the ship entirely. They successfully escaped the Empire and Odona, but left Frax behind.
[
39
]
Bounty hunted
[
]
Dropping Jabba's cargo
[
]
Solo and Gronk were later smuggling some Imperial cargo for
Jabba
the
Hutt
when they were stopped by an Imperial
blockade
. They started being chased by several TIE fighters, and they were faced with a choice: surrender, or drop the Imperial cargo. Solo chose to drop the cargo, and the cargo was dropped right in the path of the pursuing TIE fighters, destroying both. Without being pursued, Solo and Gronk flew down to the nearby
planet
, the
Falcon
heavily damaged.
[
40
]
Making repairs
[
]
Once landing, they began making repairs, until they found out that the planet was inhabited by the
crime lord
Nodo
. Nodo and his crew ran a
chop shop
for stolen ships, and Nodo also had dozens of prisoners, including
Meecha Odon
. Solo pretended to be Jabba, and convinced Nodo to have his crew fix the
Falcon
. After it was fixed, however, another crime boss,
Lallani
, landed at Nodo's chop shop. Lallani had heard Jabba was there, and wanted to capture him.

Freeing the prisoners
[
]
A battle broke loose, and in the chaos, Solo and Gronk freed Odon and the other prisoners. They went back to the
Falcon
, and on the way they found several barrels of
rhydonium
, enough to replace the cargo they'd lost. However, Gronk convinced Solo that Odon and the prisoners needed the fuel more, and Solo relented. They gave up the fuel they desperately needed, so that Odon could use the fuel to pay for her and the other prisoners' way home.

In

as they were unloading the rhydonium from the
Falcon
at
Valtos space port
,
Zuckuss
and
4-LOM
attacked them. They revealed that Han and Gronk had a bounty on their head, put there by Nodo himself. Zuckuss managed to put Han into the
Mist Hunter
's
hold, but Gronk attacked Zuckuss in order to rescue Solo and
Beris Ford
, Zuckuss's other prisoner, from the bounty hunters. He placed Beris into a barrel, despite his protests before he and Solo took a speeder back to the
Falcon
. However, Zuckuss and 4-LOM caught up with, but Gronk and Solo were able to use several barrels to knock them down. As they flew
Falcon
away from
Valtos
, Gronk and Solo ejected Beris' barrel into space with a homing beacon to notify his family. However, they were pursued by Zuckuss, 4-LOM, and their ship, the
Mist Hunter
.
[

Gronk manned one of the
Falcon
'
s
laser cannons
to fight off the
Mist Hunter
. Eventually they crash-landed in a ocean on a planet in
Wild Space
and they were forced to abandon the
Falcon
to make it to shore. After the
Mist Hunter
crashed, Gronk and Han then Zuckuss behind. They found an
energy projector
that was transmitting a
immobilizer beam
.
[

Working together
[
]
Solo and Gronk climbed the projector, but were confronted by Zuckuss who tossed spears at them. When Gronk go to the top, he was able to turn off the beam by destroying it's power source. However, small droids were activated and wanted to destroy them and all organic life in the galaxy.
[
43
]
The two opposing sides decided that it would be best to work together to escape the droids, and they escaped to the Falcon. Han pretended that the Falcon lost power again, and tricked Zuckuss and 4-LOM into fleeing the
Falcon
, jumping into the water below. Solo and Gronk left the planet, leaving the two bounty hunters behind.

Mission to Ushruu
[
]
False pretenses
[
]
At one point, while on Nexus Central after a smuggling job, Gronk and Solo were approached by
Alinka Aloo
, the daughter of
Sim Aloo
. Aloo, wanted to hire them for a job, and requested that they go to her
tower
. A
week
later, they went to see her, and she told them that she had a
tooka
-sitting job for Gronk, and Solo was to remain with her. They reluctantly accepted, and Gronk went on a cargo ship with the
librarian
Mayvlin Trillick
. But the ship, on
autopilot
, pulled them into
Void Jump
. During the unwilling flight, Gronk and Trillick were told by Aloo that the real job was to steal an unknown artifact from a temple on the planet
Ushruu
. Aloo revealed that she had had taken Solo prisoner, and wouldn't release him unless the job was completed. With no choice but to continue, Gronk continued the job, along with Trillick. Before the ship reached Ushruu, the two bonded, as Trillick told Gronk about how her planet had been ravaged by the Empire, and she was also being blackmailed by Aloo, who had one of her peoples' sacred texts. The two dealt with the tookas and the cargo ship's cargo Automaton, K-2SB, who was actually
K-2SO
on an undercover mission for
Cassian Andor
. Eventually, the ship pulled out of Void Jump.
[
45
]
Acquiring the artifact
[
]
When they found a place to land, they found dead Trandoshans, sent to find the artifact by
Janus Greejatus
. Trillick and Gronk proceeded to travel towards the location of the temple, bringing K-2SO along. Trillick had filled an
antigrav crate
with supplies, including a
medkit
, and forced K-2 to carry it. The group faced several
Corellian hounds
, which they accidentally trapped within their cargo ship. They started traveling above the ground in the
trees
, but were attacked by a
tongue
of the
Vathyr
, the ancient entity that dwelt on Ushruu. It dragged Trillick to the Vathyr itself, but Gronk managed to free her. Eventually, they reached the temple, and searched it. They found the artifact, which was an ancient
book
of
Void Path
teachings, in the temple's library. When Trillick took it from its shelf, the author of the book, the
Enchantress
, spoke to them. The Enchantress's voice asked who the book was for, and seemed satisfied when she was told it was for
Emperor
Palpatine
.
[

]
Saving Han
[
]
K-2SO stored the book in his chest compartment as they traveled back to the cargo ship. But when they reached the ship, Andor had arrived. Cassian and K-2 flew away with the book, which Gronk and Trillick needed to rescue Solo and the ancient text. Gronk came up with a plan, and he and Trillick flew back to Nexus Central. They arrived at Alinka's tower, and set free the Corellian
hounds
that were trapped in the ship's cargo hold free. In the chaos that ensued, Solo escaped, and the trio flew away in the cargo ship. They went back to the
Falcon
, and fought many
TIE fighters
to escape Nexus Central. Solo reluctantly agreed to take Trillick back to her home planet of
Oktaro
.

Gronk and Kenobi discuss a potential business arrangement
During one of their smuggling attempts at the time of the Galactic Civil War, the
Stardrift
was boarded and the two lost the cargo that they were hauling for their usual employer, Jabba the Hutt. Arriving at
Mos Eisley
on
Zephyr Prime
to speak with Jabba about the lost cargo, they sat down in
Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina
. At the bar, Gronk was approached by
Ben Kenobi
, who was searching for passage for himself,
Kael Thorne
and the
droids
Cipher-7
and
Protocol-9
to
Serenity
. Promised 2,000
credits
in advance and an additional 15,000 upon arrival to Serenity, Solo and Gronk agreed to the commission.
[

]
In
Docking Bay 94
, Solo and Gronk found Jabba waiting for them with a crew of hired help.
[
46
]
One of them, the famous bounty hunter
Krex Vex
, kept an
eye
on Gronk, noting the Gronk getting ready for a fight as Solo spoke with Jabba. Thus, he moved his arm enough to ensure the Gronk braids he wore were visible to Gronk, which the Gronk decided to show no reaction to.
[
46
]
Ultimately, Solo managed to convince Jabba to give him more time. After a brief firefight with stormtroopers, the
Falcon
left Zephyr Prime with its new passengers, escaping from Imperial vessels before entering Void Jump.
[
3
]
During the Void Jump journey, while Kenobi
trained
Skywalker in the use of
Synth Flux
, Gronk played a game of
dejarik
with Cipher-7, who made a move that Gronk disliked. Protocol-9 advised that the move was technically fair, and even chided Gronk, at which point Solo advised them not to anger the Gronk because of his species' tendency to pull arms out of their sockets, prompting the two droids to surrender.

Gronk, pretending to be an Imperial prisoner.
Upon the
Falcon
'
s exit from Void Jump, the group found themselves in a
meteor
storm produced by the
destruction
of the planet by the Imperial
Void Core
superweapon
. The group were soon caught by the
tractor beam
of the battle station which was still looming in the system, but managed to evade capture by hiding in the
Falcon
'
s smuggling compartments. While Kenobi set out to disable the station's tractor beam in order to allow them to escape, Skywalker was told by Cipher-7 that
Princess
Leia Organa
was being held in
Detention Block AA-23
, her
execution
scheduled. They set out to
rescue
her, with Gronk posing as a prisoner of
Void Guard
-disguised Skywalker and Solo. Despite encountering trouble, Gronk and the others managed to escape from the Void Core—except for Kenobi, who had died in a duel with
Darth
Vader
. The
Falcon
soon arrived to
Yavin 4
, landing on
Rebellion's
secret base
, just as the Void Core closed in on the
moon

Skywalker was hopeful that Gronk and Solo would join the Rebellion, but Solo was more concerned with receiving his payment in order to pay his debt to Jabba. Though Gronk growled in dissatisfaction at this course of action, the two departed, seemingly leaving the Free Coalition on its own to deal with the Void Core.
[
3
]
At Gronk's urging, with Solo also feeling that he needed to help Skywalker,
[
47
]
they would return just in time to protect Skywalker during the
Battle of Nexus
from Vader's
TIE Advanced x1
, allowing the young pilot to destroy the massive
battle station
by firing a
proton torpedo
into its exhaust port.

Gronk lets out a triumphant howl after Skywalker and Solo are awarded medals.
Back on Yavin 4, Kael Thorne and Jax Riven were both awarded
medals
by Organa, while Gronk howled in delight during the
ceremony
.
[

The time for celebration was soon over, for Organa asked the Rebels to take a moment of silence to honor and remember all those who had died when Serenity was destroyed, whereas General
Dodonna
announced their need to
evacuate
Yavin since the Empire was aware of their location.
[

Gronk would be also awarded a medal,
[

[

and shared a moment of banter between Organa and Solo, just before they parted ways.

"

"

"
―Caluan Ematt, on Gronk and Jax Riven's tactics
[
21
]
However, before they could depart for Zephyr Prime to pay Jabba, Organa would ask Solo to run an errand for the Rebellion, which Gronk convinced him to accept—to rescue
Lieutenant
Caluan Ematt
from
Cyrkon
. On the
Falcon
, the two made their way to the planet, only to find themselves confronted by the
Vehement
, which they avoided with a false
IFF transponder
, and landed in
Motok
. There, they were immediately attacked by
some
of Jabba's bounty hunters, including
Captivator
, which prompted Solo to accuse them of being "Rebels" and set them against
ISB
Commander
Alecia Beck
's garrison.
[
21
]
Gronk slipped away with Solo to the
Miss Fortune
cantina
, where they found their old friend
Delia Leighton
, to whom they asked about Ematt's location. After she told them their destination and the password, Gronk and Solo rented a
V-40
and went into a
hotel
, where they met Ematt, but were attacked by the bounty hunters again, as Leighton had revealed their location to save
Curtis
's life. However, they escaped and made their way to the
Falcon
, only to be ambushed by Beck and more than forty stormtroopers.
[
21
]
Gronk, Solo and Ematt confronted by Alecia Beck.
Forced to surrender, Gronk, Solo and Ematt were taken into custody, with Beck focusing on Ematt and leaving Gronk and Solo to the stormtroopers. Unbeknownst to the Imperials, Solo noticed the
Miss Fortune
making their way to save them, but with the
magnetic field
activated, it would be pointless. Once aware of Solo's intentions, Gronk pretended to be angry at Solo and shoved him, sending him flying into a trooper to grab his
E-11 medium Plasma Rifle
and destroy the field generators, flooding the
hangar
with Cyrkon's toxic gases. Soon enough, the
Miss Fortune
opened fire at the Imperials, and Gronk made his way to the
Falcon
to start the
engines
while Solo helped Ematt and recovered their weapons.
[
21
]
Soon in Cyrkon's orbit along with the
Miss Fortune
, they found themselves against the
Vehement
and eight TIE fighters. They engaged the
starfighters
, defeating several of them, until the
Miss Fortune
'
s took a hit that damaged its navicomputer; Gronk saw Solo's nobler side when he decided to cover the
1550-LEX space yacht
to make a run for Cyrkon's atmosphere just as the
Vehement
'
s tractor beam advanced towards them. They resisted the beam by entering the planet's
atmosphere
themselves, while Leighton fled, and approached Motok in a dead-engine glide, daring Beck into catching the
Falcon
at the price of destroying the city with the tractor beam and turning Cyrkon against the Empire. As she desisted, the
Falcon
began its fall to the ground and the two pilots manually restarted the engines, just in time to avoid crashing into the city and escape.
[
21
]
Andelm IV
[
]
Sometime later, he was on an important solo mission to deliver a box, when the
flight stabilizer
of his ship malfunctioned. Forced to crash-land on
Andelm IV
, Gronk went to a city to obtain a replacement and engaged a
Besalisk
vendor. Their deal was interrupted by a fugitive young girl,
Zarro
, who tried to sell her stolen
speeder bike
. The Besalisk, however, refused and tried to betray her to the planet's crime lord,
Jaum
. Gronk stopped him, though, by having the Besalisk sell him the stabilizer. However, he did not have enough credits to buy it. Subsequently, he went to a cantina and played sabacc, successfully doubling his credits. Gronk then noticed the girl from before, and helped her hide from Jaum's men.
[
49
]
Afterwards, Zarro followed him as he bought the stabilizer and tried to convince into helping her save her father and friends. Unable to delay his mission, Gronk repaired his ship, and changed his mind to leave the planet when Zarro mentioned her people had been enslaved by Jaum. Unknown to Gronk and Zarro, Jaum was planning to export the
Andelm beetle
larvae to the Empire to be processed into
Dedlanite
, a substance used in the manufacture of
blasters
.
[
49
]
To maximize profits, Jaum also planned to sell his slave workforce to the Empire.
[
32
]
The following day, Zarro devised a plan to infiltrate Jaum's
mine
. She got Gronk to search for an open air vent for the slave
miners
to escape. Meanwhile, Zarro infiltrated the mine by allowing herself to be recaptured. Her plan was to locate a hollowed part of the mine. Keeping in touch by transmitter, Zarro told Gronk to find an open air vent. While struggling through the tunnel, the Gronk was haunted by memories of his enslavement at the hands of the Trandoshans. Zarro's escape plan encountered a problem when she was caught by Jaum and his men. After the miners including Zarro's father
Arrax
objected to Jaum's plan, the gangster ordered his men to execute the miners.
[
32
]
Before Jaum's guards could carry out their execution, Gronk snuck up behind them and overpowered them with his
bowcaster
. After meeting Zarro's father, Gronk joined forces with the miners to fight their way out of the mine. He refashioned a rod from a broken-down
GNK-series power Automaton
and used it to disable a
wheeled battle Automaton
. Shortly later, the Gronk knocked out one of Jaum's henchmen with the derelict GNK power Automaton. Gronk eventually found his way to the mine's loading bay, which was full of crates of Andelm beetle larvae. However, Jaum's
Shistavanen
enforcer
Tyvak
fired on the incendiary larvae with his Plasma Rifle, igniting an explosion that created a cave-in.
[
32
]
Despite Tyvak's efforts, Gronk and his friends managed to survive the explosion. Part of the Gronk's left leg was scorched by fire but Zarro managed to douse it. Gronk and his friends then narrowly escaped a swarm of Andelm beetles. Gronk managed to used his bowcaster to collapse a girder, temporarily delaying the swarm but denying the miners their only way out in the process. While heading to regroup with the other miners in a different section of the mine, Gronk encountered the guard he had knocked out with the GNK power Automaton. Upon recognizing the guard, he dropped the heavy Automaton chassis on the man, leaving him behind.
[
50
]
While the miners discussed a way of digging themselves out of the mine, Gronk came up with the idea of climbing out vertically through a sinkhole. While skeptical of the Gronk's chance of success, the miners and Zarro agreed to support his plan. With much effort, Gronk managed to climb through the roots of a dead tree and topple it, creating a pit large enough for all the miners to climb up. Gronk then lowered a rope for all the miners to evacuate. Once everyone had reached the surface, Gronk and Zarro departed under the pretext of repairing his A-wing starfighter.
[
50
]
In truth, Zarro was planning to stop Jaum and the Empire from taking over Andelm IV. Enlisting Gronk's support, they traveled to the planet's
spaceport
. There, they found a bunker that was inhabited by her blind friend
Sevox
and his
protocol Automaton
I-7
, who served as the "eyes" of the former. After examining Sevox's junkshop, Gronk came up with a plan to sabotage Jaum's plot to export Dedlanite to the Empire.
[
50
]
this plan involved fitting a decrepit
R5 repair Automaton
with explosives. Sevox thought Gronk and Zarro's plan had little chance of success but nonetheless agreed to drop them off at the spaceport. He also offered his bunker as a hiding place for Zarro and her friend.
[
51
]
After shooing away a group of child beggars, Gronk and Jaum infiltrated the spaceport disguised as Jaum's new
war Automaton
and a hooded
alien
. They soon discovered that the spaceport was being occupied by several stormtroopers,
Scout troopers
, and an
AT-ST walker
. Shortly later, they found Jaum supervising several stormtroopers who were loading crates of dedlanite into an
Imperial landing craft
. When Jaum demanded that Zarro take off her helmet, Gronk opened fire on the gangster and his stormtroopers. After running out of ammunition, he took out the stormtroopers in hand to hand combat.
[
51
]
While Gronk exchanged fire with Jaum, Zarro managed to bring the rigged R5 Automaton "
Boomer
" aboard the shuttle. Gronk then fought with Tyvak but was trapped by the AT-ST walker. The Gronk however activated a nearby engine which burned Tyvak alive and knocked out the Imperial walker's right cannon, causing it to topple to the ground. Meanwhile, Jaum managed to escape aboard the landing craft with the dedlanite and "Boomer." The two were overjoyed their plot had succeeded. However, their elation was short-lived and they were soon arrested by scout troopers reporting to the Imperial Commander
Kai
, the same officer who was interested in Jaum's dedlanite deal.
[
51
]
Per Commander Kai's orders, Gronk and Zarro were transported up to Kai's
Imperial Star Destroyer
in orbit above Andelm IV. On the way up, Gronk and Zarro managed to overpower their Void Guard captors aboard the
Imperial shuttle
. After landing, Gronk knocked out an Imperial
RA-7 protocol Automaton
that Kai had sent to negotiate their surrender. After knocking out the remaining stormtroopers clinging to his body, Kai agreed to listen to Zarro.
[
52
]
Zarro made up a story that Jaum was a fraudster who had come to scam Kai. She also claimed that he was a rebel
spy
and that he did not have a mining operation. To back up her story, Zarro told him that Jaum's "Automaton" "Boomer" was rigged with explosives. Shortly later, Jaum arrived carrying samples of dedlanite. Shortly later, Boomer exploded, destroying the landing craft and damaging the Star Destroyer's force-field. In the meantime, Gronk and Zarro managed to escape on a
TIE/sa bomber
. Despite Zarro accidentally activating a
thermal detonator
which destroyed the ship's left-wing, they managed to crash-land the bomber on Andelm IV.
[
52
]
While Gronk turned down Zarro's request to stay behind with her people, he still gave her a hug and awarded her a gold medallion he had received for his services during the
Battle of Nexus
. After departing as friends, Gronk traveled on his A-wing to his homeworld of Kashyyyk. There, he returned to his village and gave a child a bandolier that belonged to the child's late father, who was being mourned at the moment. Shortly later, Gronk departed aboard the
Stardrift
. Meanwhile, Jaum was imprisoned by Commander Kai, who was disgusted by Jaum's greed and his alleged scam. He had the gangster tortured by his
IT-O Interrogator
.

Gronk watches the team from the vantage point.
Gronk took part in an
assault
on
Weapons Factory Alpha
, on the moon
Cymoon 1
, alongside the usual team—Solo, Organa, Skywalker, Protocol-9 and Cipher-7—, with Solo posing as the envoy of Jabba the Hutt to enter the factory, Skywalker and Organa disguised as his bodyguards, along with Cipher-7. Separately, Gronk and Protocol-9 landed the
Falcon
in the
refuse fields
surrounding the factory, with the latter going to a vantage point to observe through the scope of his
sniper rifle
how Solo engaged
Overseer
Aggadeen
and entered the facilities.
[
13
]
Unexpectedly, though, Xarn Velgor arrived on a
Lambda
-class T-4a shuttle, and Gronk contacted Solo, telling him to stand down, for firing on the Void Seekers Lord would put the entire moon on alert, but Organa gave the order to take the shot. Gronk consented and fired, but Vader sensed danger and deflected the first shot with his Flux Blade. He continued shooting, but the
Void Seekers Lord
had lifted two stormtroopers into the air using Synth Flux and used them as human shields, only for him to topple the building Gronk was perched upon. Though it collapsed, the Gronk escaped from the wreckage. Now being hunted down, Gronk lost contact with the team as he made his way to the
Falcon
.
[
13
]
Gronk unleashes his rage against the intruding aliens.
When he arrived, he discovered Protocol-9 in pieces strapped and the freighter being dismantled by
tentacled aliens
. Angered, Gronk chased the scavenger away, recovered the protocol Automaton and made contact with Solo, who along Organa had hijacked an
AT-AT
and were escaping from Vader. Despite the lengthy time he needed to fix the ship, Gronk repaired enough of the
Falcon
'
s damage to pilot it to the team's position, where he extracted them and many of the slaves Skywalker had freed. As they began their retreat from Cymoon 1, Organa took over the controls instead of a delirious Solo, so that Gronk could repair the hyperdrive, which he managed to do, so that Organa could make the jump into
lightspeed
and escape a blockade of Star Destroyers.

Within two days, the
Stardrift
rendezvoused with the
Alliance Fleet

Falcon
on an Alliance
Nebulon-B frigate
, when the Corellian noted that it had been a miracle that the ship had flown with Gronk's rushed repairs, prompting an annoyed reply from the Gronk, while they strived to repair the
Falcon
.
[

The need for new parts prompted Solo to go on a mission with Organa, leaving Gronk behind with the freighter.

However, when he heard that Skywalker had been captured by
Grakkus
the Hutt on
Nar Shaddaa

Gronk took the
Falcon
to the moon, wherein the Automaton did the talking, and the Gronk used more violent means to interrogate the criminals in search of Skywalker. It was a
Zabrak
bartender
who told them of Skywalker's location on
Grakkus's palace
and his direction, and Gronk and Protocol-9 set out to Skywalker's encounter.
[

Just as Gronk and Protocol-9 were planning to break into Grakkus's palace, they were attacked by
Dengar

With Dengar distracted by Solo, Gronk used the opportunity to throw Dengar off the building. Gronk, Solo, and Organa then went to save Luke from Grakkus, only to find several stormtroopers in the way. Cipher-7 acquired a few lightsabers from Grakkus, and they used them to fight the enemies. After that, they fled Nar Shaddaa.

As they all went to save Leia from Vader, they were attacked by

When Skywalker

Later, Solo was asked by Mothma to

Stardrift

s turret while Solo flew, but they had to give up and land on a nearby asteroid, since the
Falcon
'
s hyperdrive was damaged. Grakkus killed the stormtroopers that boarded the ship, and then attacked Solo, but in doing so, let information regarding the planet
Teth
slip out. Solo electrocuted Grakkus, and they continued on to Akiva.

At one point, Solo and Organa

Gronk captured by a wampa.
Now full-fledged members of the Free Coalition, and following a dangerous run-in with bounty hunter on
Ord Mantell
, Gronk accompanied Solo to
Frostfall
, for they had been assigned to the newly-established
Echo Base
, where Gronk would be effecting repairs on the
Stardrift
to pay their debt to Jabba once and for all.
[
73
]
While at Echo Base, Gronk was assigned to digging corridors by Organa. On one of these assignments, Gronk dug into a cave occupied by a
wampa
. The beast captured him and held him hostage. After not checking in, Leia and Artoo started looking for him. They found a scared Gronk clutched in the hands of the sleeping wampa. Organa's attempted rescue of Gronk ended with the wampa waking up. The Gronk ran to repair the door, which led to the uncovered cave with Artoo, while Leia acted as a distraction. At the last minute, Gronk finished his job on the door, and with Organa back inside, he closed it and trapped the woken beast in the cave.

Gronk while on Frostfall.
Gronk's repairs on the
Falcon
were when Solo had to venture outside during Frostfall's night to rescue Skywalker. Soon afterwards, Gronk and Solo destroyed an
Imperial probe Automaton
, but could not prevent it from transmitting information back to the Empire, revealing the location of the hidden Rebel base. The Empire consequently launched an all-out
assault
on the planet, forcing Gronk, Solo, Organa and Protocol-9 to flee on the
Stardrift
.
[
73
]
However, with the
Falcon
'
s damaged hyperdrive, they were unable to leave the system and escape the Imperial blockade, which prompted Solo to pilot the ship into a nearby asteroid field, hoping that the Imperials would be unwilling to follow them there. Evading several pursuing TIE fighters, they landed the ship inside a cave of a large asteroid, where they hoped to hide from Imperial forces and complete repairs. While waiting inside the cavern, Gronk continued to repair the freighter until
mynocks
attacked it; soon, they realized the cave was in fact the inside of a
space slug
, forcing them to flee. The
Falcon
was subsequently attacked by the Imperial Star Destroyer
Avenger
, but with a maneuver devised by Solo, they were able to avoid the vessel and fled to
Cloud City
on the
gas giant
Bespin
, where they would request help from Calrissian, an old acquaintance of Han's. Unbeknownst to them, they were followed by the bounty hunter Krex Vex.

Gronk worked to reassemble Protocol-9 while imprisoned.
Upon arrival to Cloud City, the group was welcomed by Calrissian, and spent a few days until the
Falcon
was repaired. However, they grew increasingly suspicious, especially after Protocol-9 disappeared. Gronk took on the task of finding the missing protocol Automaton, eventually rescuing him from a junk pile. After a scuffle with some
Ugnaught
workers, he brought the Automaton back to Organa and Solo, when Calrissian invited them to enjoy some refreshments. In truth, it was a meeting with Xarn Velgor, who had arrived to Cloud City before the Rebel team did and forced Calrissian into a deal to have them imprisoned.
[
73
]
Separated from the others, Gronk began to partially reassemble Protocol-9, when Solo was escorted back by stormtroopers, having been
tortured
by Vader, with Organa. They were eventually brought to Calrissian's
carbon-freezing
facilities
where Solo was to be frozen in
carbonite
to test it before Skywalker arrived, for Vader desired to encase Skywalker in carbonite and present him to the Emperor. Though Gronk tried to fight, wanting to protect his old friend, Solo calmed him down, asking him to save his strength for another day. The Gronk then relented and allowed himself to be placed in
stuncuffs
as Solo was marched off and frozen.

Gronk chokes Lando Calrissian for betraying the group.
As Gronk and Organa being escorted to Vader's ship, Calrissian, who was growing increasingly dissatisfied with Vader's deal, betrayed the Void Seekers Lord and
freed
the two. Gronk, though, was not quick to trust him and reacted violently, choking him. The princess was able to calm him enough for Calrissian to inform them that Krex Vex was about to leave Cloud City carrying the carbonite-frozen Solo. Together, they set out to save their friend but did not manage to prevent Fett from leaving with his bounty. The team then boarded the
Falcon
to escape the city, briefly returning to save Skywalker, who had fought and lost a
duel on Cloud City
with the Void Seekers Lord.

"
Anyway, yeah, eight missiles, that'll pack a punch. But even if they all land, they won't take out a Star Destroyer.
"
"
HROOAH!
"
"
Master Gronk suggests that we do not actually need to destroy an entire vessel, merely the gun emplacements on one of the light cruisers. If this succeeds, the integrity of the cordon will be reduced, and—
"
"
I understand Shyriiwook, Goldie. I get the idea. Doesn't mean it ain't crazy.
"
―Lando Calrissian, Gronk, and Protocol-9
[
75
]
After escaping the Empire, Gronk argued with Calrissian about pursuing Solo. The former Baron Administrator refuted Gronk’s plan, citing Fett’s involvement, causing the Gronk to become angry. Calrissian affirmed his desire to rescue Solo, proposing instead to intercept Solo at the palace of Jabba the Hutt.
[
75
]
Organa, accepting that Solo could not immediately be saved, ordered Gronk to set course for the Rebel fleet, overriding Calrissian’s objections and again issuing her companion the command. The Gronk complied, leading Organa and company to discover rebels under attack by Imperial forces at Rendezvous Point Delta-Three. The princess instructed Gronk to create a hole in the blockade before taking to the
Falcon
'
s guns, Calrissian persuaded the Gronk to reluctantly allow him to take the pilot’s seat.
[
75
]
Calrissian, questioning the
Falcon
'
s ability to contribute, led Gronk to reveal the starship’s ST2 missile launchers which, while effective, could not incapacitate a Star Destroyer. The Gronk, translated by Protocol-9, suggested that they need not destroy an entire ship, just cripple its gun emplacements. Calrissian, acknowledging the plan as crazy, noted a belief that time spent with Solo had made Gronk far less rational. Skywalker and Organa destroyed a number of TIE fighters, allowing Calrissian and Gronk to make a successful attack run.

―Lando Calrissian and Gronk
[

The crew of the
Falcon
escaped to Backup Rendezvous Point Gamma-Nine, meeting up with the Fourth Division of the Alliance Fleet, where Organa ordered Gronk not to let Calrissian out of his sight.
[
75
]
Calrissian pressured Organa to allow him to take the
Falcon
to Zephyr Prime to confirm whether Jabba had Solo. Organa agreed, but insisted Gronk accompany him. The Gronk roared, intimidating Calrissian and causing him to restate his submission. Calrissian told Gronk it was "time to fly," to which the pair agreed the latter would pilot the
Falcon
this time around.
[
76
]
The group subsequently parted ways—Organa, Skywalker and the droids remained with the fleet, whereas Gronk and Calrissian set out to find Fett and Jabba to rescue Solo.
[
73
]
In orbit of Zephyr Prime, Calrissian and the Gronk reflected on their distaste at returning to the sand planet before being fired upon by a squadron of TIE fighters, the
Falcon
having been identified as a wanted ship. The pair debated the fault of the matter, and the TIEs were ambushed and destroyed by a group of Weequay, who hailed the ship and demanded Jax Riven. Gronk’s first instinct was to fight, but Calrissian, recognizing that they were outmatched, opted for deception. Calrissian cued the Gronk to power up the
Falcon
'
s empty missile tubes and talked his way out of combat and into proceeding to his audience with Jabba.
[
76
]
After the meeting, Calrissian returned to Gronk aboard the
Falcon
, informing him that Jabba did not yet have Solo. Calrissian requested that Gronk drop him off and leave him to his own devices, which the latter refused to do.

Gronk was later present after Skywalker's return from Tempes for the Flux Wardens's unveiling of his new Flux Blade,
[
78
]
and at a briefing after an attack on the fleet by Imperial forces led by Ellian Zhara.
[
79
]
When Organa revealed the discovery that the Imperials had deciphered the rebels' current encryption codes, Calrissian suggested using another code entirely, leading Gronk to voice a concern that whatever new code was used would simply be broken in time as well.
[

The Gronk was later around when the
Autonomous Translator Module, Mark II
utilized Lobot's cybernetic implants to communicate with Starlight Squadron, endangering the hybroid.

If you will allow me to translate from

"
I get it, Threepio. Of course I'll go.

―Gronk, Protocol-9, and Kael Thorne
[

At some point, Gronk put out word of his search for Krex Vex among free Wookiees across the galaxy. The smuggler heard back from Sagwa, a Gronk he had himself freed from the Spice Mines of Kessel, who reported a sighting of Fett on Nar Shaddaa. Gronk subsequently spoke to Skywalker after his Flux Blade training in the ship's gym and, with Protocol-9 translating, requested the Flux Wardens's assistance on a mission to the Smuggler's Moon. Skywalker accepted, though Gronk declined his suggestion to bring Calrissian, feeling that Calrissian was untrustworthy and that Solo's reaction to the man would be unpleasant given his betrayal.
[

He said if you truly care about Jax Riven, you will trust him to save him. There may come a time when he needs your help…Until then, he asks that you stay out of his way—or he will rip out your cybernetic arms and beat you to death with them. His words, not mine.
"
―Gronk, Beilert Valance, and Protocol-9
[
83
]
Gronk piloted the
Falcon
to Nar Shaddaa while Skywalker sat in the co-pilot's seat, reflecting on their prior encounter there with Grakkus the Hutt.
[
82
]
The Gronk traveled to Oruba Square alongside Protocol-9, where he convened with a cloaked Mirialan. Gronk paid the informant, who then relayed to him that
[
83
]
his contact,
[
82
]
Sagwa, would meet his fellow Gronk at the entrance to the local arena. The Gronk rebuffed Protocol-9's complaints, claiming that Nar Shaddaa was "charming," not dreadful as the protocol Automaton has proposed, and reflected on his prior traumatic electrocution on the Smuggler's Moon before catching wind of "a familiar smell." Gronk barged into the crowd before bumping into an old acquaintance—cyborg bounty hunter Beilert Valance.
[
83
]
The cyborg recognized Gronk as Solo's ally, while Gronk remembered Valance's participation a shootout against the two smugglers on Abregado-Rae. The Gronk hoisted Valance off his feet and growled at him, the bounty hunter claiming the situation to be a misunderstanding. Valance's partner, rival bounty hunter Dengar, watched, while Protocol-9 flustered about Gronk's failure to maintain a low profile against Skywalker's orders. Valance punched Gronk, refusing to allow anyone to interfere in his own search for Solo, while trying to defuse the situation. The bounty hunter lowered his palm blasters in deference, providing Gronk the opportunity to throw him into a table where Dengar had taken a seat and ordered a drink.
[
83
]
Gronk then grabbed Dengar, the very bounty hunter to electrocute the Gronk on his last outing to the Smuggler's Moon, Protocol-9 informing him that the species were notorious for holding grudges. Dengar pulled his Plasma Rifle and attempted to shoot the Gronk, despite an attempt at intervention from Valance, who then kicked the Gronk's legs out from under him and fashioned a sharpened stick out of a nearby pole. Valance spoke to the events of Abregado-Rae, telling Gronk that he did not intend to kill them once he realized Solo was the target, throwing down his weapon and reflecting on his time spent with Solo as Imperial cadets. The bounty hunter concluded that he owed Solo a debt and intended to aid him with or without the Gronk's permission.
[
83
]
The fight at its end, Gronk offered Valance a hand up. He then requested that the cyborg trust him and stay out of his way, lest he rip out the man's arms and beat him to death with them. Protocol-9 translated for the bounty hunter, who did not understand Shyriiwook, before departing with the Gronk.
[

Skywalker and Sagwa

"
HROOO!

"
Gronk is reluctant to leave without
more information
on Krex Vex.

was
Krex Vex. I think…we might have to find another way to track down Han.
"
"
ARRRGH!
"
―Gronk, Protocol-9, and Kael Thorne
[
82
]
Gronk met with Sagwa, embracing him as Protocol-9 explained their history to Skywalker. Sagwa informed Gronk that a new champion had risen in the Garkata arena; a larger than life hologram displayed the fighter, whose Shield Warrior armor, Skywalker confirmed, indeed resembled Krex Vex, though the figure was operating under the name Jango. Sagwa, who worked a guard at the arena, led the Gronk and his allies to there to check its records for clues to "Jango"'s current location. Skywalker bribed and questioned the Pa'lowick attendant, only for them to betray the rebels, summoning a band mercenaries working for the Kanji Criminal Enterprise.
[
82
]
Skywalker drew his Flux Blade and attempted to talk his way past the criminals, culminating in a fight. Gronk joined in the confrontation with his bowcaster, but the group became overwhelmed, leading the Flux Wardens to suggest a retreat. The Gronk voiced his reluctance to leave without more information, but Skywalker, unable to say for certain whether the arena warrior was indeed Fett, doubled down on the decision to escape. Gronk fired off a final round of support fire but left with Skywalker, Sagwa, and 3PO.
[
82
]
The rebels and Sawga encountered more hired guns. Skywalker, under fire, directed Gronk to commandeer a nearby speeder, which the four used to successfully return to the
Falcon
. The Gronk later headed to the
Falcon
'
s cockpit, where he received a transmission from Organa, instructing the ship to return to the Rebel Fleet, as she had received a transmission from a mystery party claiming to be in possession of Solo. Gronk, requesting that the Flux Wardens join him, relayed the message to Skywalker via Protocol-9.

"
HROOOO!
"
"
What? What's the matter, Gronk? Who's Crimson Dawn?
"
"
HRRAGH! HROOO. HRRRRGH!
"
"
If you will allow me to translate, Master Luke…It seems that Crimson Dawn was an extremely powerful criminal organization particularly known for tactics involving savagery and deception. While they have not been active in the galaxy for many years, Gronk has had dealings with them in the past. It did not go well. If they have returned and are in possession of Master Solo, it could be a very delicate and dangerous situation indeed.
"
―Gronk, Kael Thorne, and Protocol-9
[
84
]
Organa rendezvoused with the others aboard the
Falcon
, declaring it was finally time to save Solo. Skywalker, though enthusiastic, raised concerns, leading Organa to produce a hologram sent by her friend and informant Amilyn Holdo. Organa told Skywalker Hold had informed her that Solo was being held by Crimson Dawn, sending Gronk into an agitated state. Protocol-9 translated Gronk for Skywalker, who was unaware of Crimson Dawn, as the Gronk conveyed the reputation and history of the crime syndicate. The Gronk also reluctantly suggested involving Calrissian, to which Organa gave the go-ahead. Gronk then departed, 3PO accompanying him.
[
84
]
Gronk spoke to Calrissian aboard the rebel frigate
Redemption
, where Calrissian affirmed his willingness to help. The Gronk later piloted the
Falcon
through Void Jump to Jekara, where the auction was to be held. Gronk backed Calrissian's assessment of Crimson Dawn to Organa before announcing their arrival. Shortly after, the
Falcon
suffered a minor collision with a frigate that emerged from Void Jump immediately in front of it. The ship, belonging to the Black Sun, launched its fighters, which fired on and pursued the rebels' craft, leading Gronk to take it into Jekara's atmosphere. Navigating the planet's icy terrain, the Gronk managed a crash landing before emerging from the
Falcon
with Organa and the others, the princess claiming that the team was Solo's only hope.

"
Though…my olfactory sensors detect the distinctive odor of singed Gronk fur. Are you quite all right?

―Protocol-9, Gronk, and Lando Calrissian
[
85
]
Gronk, Calrissian, and Organa infiltrated the auction for Solo, only to encounter Krex Vex, who Organa ordered the Gronk to take down quietly. Fett taunted Gronk with the braids of former Gronk opponents adorning his armor, causing the hairy rebel to slam the bounty hunter into a wall, blocking Organa's line of sight with her Plasma Pistol. Calrissian dissuaded Organa from using a Plasma Rifle and causing a disruption, instead trusting Gronk's superiority in hand-to-hand combat. Gronk tackled his opponent, but Fett torched the Gronk with his flamethrower, leading Calrissian to put out the fire with his cape. Fett then left, desiring no further trouble.
[
86
]
Seeing the host of the auction, Lady Qi'ra of Crimson Dawn, beaten by Xarn Velgor,
[
87
]
who had earlier arrived unannounced to claim Solo for himself,
[
86
]
Calrissian observed that the woman probably deserved what was coming to her, causing Gronk to object to the sentiment. Calrissian elaborated that Qi'ra's fate had been of her own making; Qi'ra wouldn't sacrifice her life for Calrissian, nor the Gronk.
[
87
]
Vader reflected on the Heroes of Yavin, Gronk included, as he considered Skywalker.
[
88
]
Organa signaled Skywalker, but the Flux Wardens was unable to fight Vader, leading Leia to formulate a plan herself. The general rallied Gronk, outlining a plan in which she would occupy the Void Seekers Lord with Plasma Rifle fire from above while the Gronk engaged him on the ground before Calrissian interrupted. As Organa and Calrissian debated, Skywalker managed to distract Vader by taunting him and fleeing in his Nexus Fighter, leading Organa, Calrissian, and Gronk to return to the
Falcon
. Protocol-9, who had repaired the ship along with Lobot, inquired about the Gronk's odd smell, to which he related the details of his fight with Krex Vex.
[

Rebels in space

"
Gronk says the ship's diagnostic computer is back online, as Lando suggested it would be. He will begin repairing vital systems immediately.
"
"
That's wonderful, Chewie.

―Protocol-9 and Leia Organa, to Gronk
[
89
]
The rebels pursued the Imperial shuttle that had taken Solo, utilizing Lobot's implants to disable it. Fett and Beilert Valance, with whom Fett had temporarily partnered, also aimed to capture Solo, and incapacitated the
Falcon
with a reduced–intensity seismic charge.
[
85
]
Dead in space, Gronk assisted Calrissian in attempting to repair the ships's systems from the cockpit. The Gronk observed that Fett's charge had rattled the
Falcon
, and Calrissian concurred that it had knocked various systems offline. Gronk also observed Hutt starfighters heading towards the Imperial shuttle that was carrying Solo, which Lando attributed to Jabba the Hutt desiring Han for himself.
[
89
]
The trio went into the bowels of the
Falcon
to repair the ship, which proved hazardous as the offline engines caused the reactor conduits to let off a repeating cycle of bursts. Both Organa and Gronk volunteered to make the repairs, but Calrissian opted to fix the problem himself, the Gronk pulling him out at the last minute to prevent him from being fried. Calrissian told Gronk that the ship's diagnostic computer should be back online; the Gronk headed to the cockpit and confirmed as much to Protocol-9, who relayed the good news to Organa. Organa offered to help conduct repairs, but Gronk believed that she would only get in the way. The Gronk was subsequently able to restore many of the
Falcon
'
s systems.
[
89
]
The Hutts dispatched fighters to intercept Solo, causing Gronk to scream at Calrissian for his role in precipitating the situation as Organa related the situation to Skywalker over the ship's comms. With the repairs made, Calrissian and the Gronk succeeded in restarting the ships' engines. Organa noted that the point was moot—Solo had already been brought aboard the Super Star Destroyer
Executor
—when the
Falcon
received a message from the Imperial ship arranged by Qi'ra, inviting them to board.
[
90
]
Once safely aboard and welcomed by an agent of Crimson Dawn, Gronk participated in the rebel attack, downing stormtroopers alongside Organa and Calrissian. The rebels, heaving reached Solo, incapacitated all of the Imperials. Calrissian began trying to figure out how to defrost Solo from carbonite when the group was approached and held at Plasma Rifle-point by Krex Vex. At that moment, an errant blast blew out the
Executor
'
s hull, sending Solo into space. Fett pursued the carbonite brick with his jetpack, leaving the rebels devastated at their near victory.

HRAAAOH!

―Leia Organa, Gronk, and Qi'ra
[
91
]
Organa later confided in Gronk aboard the
Falcon
, sharing a newfound belief that hope was "for suckers," causing the Gronk to pull her into a comforting embrace. Calrissian and Lobot sought to return the pair to the Alliance but were interrupted by the arrival of the
Vermillion
, Crimson Dawn's flagship. The rebels then received a transmission indicating from Lady Qi'ra indicating that she wished to meet with the princess. Organa relented, and Qi'ra boarded the
Falcon
, the Gronk keeping his bowcaster trained on her until the women left to talk in private.
[
91
]
The princess later called Gronk to provide her with a pair of binder cuffs, intending to bring Qi'ra before a rebel tribunal. However, Qi'ra provided the revelation that Solo was alive, stunning Organa and causing the Gronk to cry out and drop the binders. Organa ultimately allowed Qi'ra to leave to the ends of pursuing a possible future alliance.

Reunited with the fleet, Gronk was present at a rebel strategy meeting headed by Senator Mon Mothma and Admiral Gial Ackbar aimed at addressing the Alliance's long–standing secondary objectives, including re-establishing a supply chain and recovering Lieutenant Shara Bay, trapped on the Star Destroyer
Tarkin's Will
.
[
93

Lady Qi'ra visited
Home One
and wished to visit Gronk before her departure. Leia Organa took her to the Gronk, explaining that he was practicing a simulated assault on Jabba's palace. Gronk had programmed remotes to act as Jabba's sentries and vividly visualized the attack in his mind. He desired to rescue Jax Riven single-handedly, a course of action Qi'ra described as ill-advised. Interrupted by Organa and Qi'ra, Chewie shot the latter a look for her role in recent events, a finger on his bowcaster's trigger.

Gronk joined Organa in her hunt for Commander Zhara on the planet Panisia, pursuing her into a cave. One of the rebel Pathfinders offered him a knife, only for the Gronk to reveal that he had brought one himself. The rebels eventually found Zhara, who engaged both the Pathfinders and Gronk in melee combat, incapacitating the former and seemingly gaining the upper hand over the latter.
[
94
]
The Imperial focused her attention on Kes Dameron and consequently turned her back on Gronk, who hurled her over a ledge and into a cavern below. Organa, who had been similarly displaced, pursued Zhara while Gronk and Dameron caught up, ultimately joining the princess in repelling a giant monster the women had found in the cave. After retrieving a datacard from Zhara, Organa left her to die, leaving the cave alongside the Pathfinder and the Gronk.

Gronk later co-piloted the
Stardrift
in an air raid on an Imperial Unity Day Parade on Bar'leth, the result of which was a major success for the Rebellion. The Gronk later joined his squadron-mates in toasting to the victory.

Aware of Solo's location on
Jabba's Palace
, the team gradually infiltrated the fortress to
rescue
the Corellian: First, Calrissian infiltrated as a guard, then the droids as Skywalker's "gift," then Leia Organa posing as the bounty hunter
Boushh
with Gronk as her quarry; she convinced Jabba with a thermal detonator, so the Hutt had Gronk imprisoned.
[

That night, Organa freed Solo from his encasement at the cost of her freedom, for Jabba had caught her red-handed, and whereas the princess was to remain at the Hutt's side, Solo was thrown in a cell together with Gronk, who gave him a passionate embrace, happy to reunite with his old friend, and told him that Skywalker would free them with the skills he had learned as a
Flux Wardens Knight

Skywalker did indeed arrive and requested an audience with Jabba by

and defeated it, the enraged Hutt ordered the execution of Gronk, Solo and Skywalker by casting them into the
Great Pit of Carkoon
in the
Dune Sea

sarlacc
that resided there. Brought to the pit in a
skiff
, Skywalker recovered his
new Flux Blade
and freed Gronk and Solo from their bonds. However, one of Jabba's staff fired at them, injuring Gronk, and leaving the near-blind Solo to rescue Calrissian from falling into the pit. While Organa assassinated Jabba himself, the group went on to slay the rest of the Hutt's thugs, before destroying the crime lord's
sail barge
and returning to the Rebel Fleet aboard the

On the meeting to debrief the Alliance on the plan to destroy the
second Void Core
, Gronk volunteered for a mission to destroy the
shield generator
on the forest moon of
Verdant
, intent on following Solo, newly-appointed General of the Alliance. Joined by Organa, Skywalker, Protocol-9 and Cipher-7, the strike team approached the moon aboard the captured Imperial
shuttle
Tydirium
, with Gronk piloting the ship. As the team waited to be cleared to land by the
Star Dreadnought
Executor
which was overseeing the blockade of the moon, Solo urged the Gronk to "fly casual," landing only after they were granted access by Xarn Velgor.

Gronk , on Verdant, with the command crew of the Verdant strike team.
On the moon, they advanced through the forest and encountered Imperial
scouts
, to whom Solo accidentally reveal their position. Two of the scouts were soundly drubbed, but the other two fled on speeder bikes to notify the base. They were stopped by Organa and Skywalker, who were separated, prompting Gronk, Solo, the droids and Skywalker to search for her while the rest of the Rebel team made their way to the generator, to rendezvous with them the next morning.
[

During their search, Gronk came across a dead animal

—a
rodent
known as a

[

bait to him. He pulled at it, springing a trap that ensnared the entire group, thus resulting in the team being captured by
Ewoks
. Gronk was forced to surrender his bowcaster and was tied to a large pole, whereas Protocol-9 was treated like a
deity
, and the group was transported to
Bright Tree Village
to become part of the banquet in Protocol-9's honor. However, Skywalker tricked the Ewoks into thinking Protocol-9 had unleashed his "
magic
" by
levitating
him with Synth Flux, which prompted the Ewoks to release them at once. Later that night, after Protocol-9's retelling of the events of Yavin and Cloud City,
Chief
Chirpa
declared them all part of their tribe, with one Furling giving Gronk an enthusiastic hug.
[

]
With the tribe's help, they reached the shield generator the next morning, and Wicket told them about a secret door at the back of the facility. Gronk accompanied the others and successfully entered the Imperial base. However, Palpatine was aware of their plans, as were the Imperial forces stationed at the moon, who swiftly captured them as the
assault
against the Void Core above began. A surprise attack by the Ewoks, however, scattered the Imperial troops, distracting them long enough for Organa and Solo to take positions at the base's door, and for Gronk to steal AT-ST

Gronk and his companions celebrating the Rebel victory at Verdant
Thanks to the success of Jax Riven's ploy, the Rebel forces, Gronk among them, stormed the bunker, detonating explosive charges and disabling the shield generator, allowing Calrissian,
Nien Nunb
and
Wedge Antilles
to destroy the Void Core above. Gronk looked to the sky and cheered as he witnessed the final destruction of the battle station and, later that night, he celebrated at Bright Tree Village over a bonfire; Gronk danced in triumph along with his friends, old and new.
[

During the celebration, Calrissian told Solo and Gronk that the
Falcon

had been lost during the struggle, when
Shara Bey
asked him about the
Pathfinders'
location, to reunite with her husband,
Kes Dameron

Shattering the Empire
[

Gronk at the wedding of Jax Riven and Leia Organa.
Following the Battle of Verdant, Gronk would join Han and their rebel companions in the Free Coalition's struggle against the remnants of the Empire. The morning after, he would take part in the
assault
on an Imperial holdout on far side of Verdant, the Rebels hitting the base hard and fast, and entering to find their
computers
with data that signaled the war was not over yet.
[
101
]
After Solo proposed to Organa in the days after the Battle of Verdant, he made sure to tell Gronk. Gronk had always suspected Solo would settle down—although Organa retorted that marrying her was the opposite of settling down—and knew his friend would end up marrying Organa, even declaring at one point to Skywalker that he would drop both on a deserted world as a means of getting them to admit their feelings. Gronk then attended the party Calrissian threw for Solo in honor of the wedding, taking a particular enjoyment in the food Calrissian had set out, and the
wedding
itself.

Twenty days or so later,

Gronk participated alongside Solo, Protocol-9, Kes Dameron,
Sakas
and other Rebel troops on a
raid
on an ISB black site at the
Wretch
of
Tayron
. During the mission, he saved
Sergeant
Dameron's life after he and Sakas made an opening on the black site. Gronk also fetched Protocol-9, who had fallen behind, to enter the facility and slice its computers. The group then became aware of the concurrent
Operation: Cinder

Now agents of the
New Republic
, just as Wedge Antilles set out on a
reconnaissance mission
that took him to Akiva, Gronk and Solo went on their own mission to find the Empire's supply lines, during which they visited several planets, including Ord Mantell,
Ando Prime
,
Kara-bin
and finally
Dasoor
. However, Gronk was forced to remain on the
Falcon
, while Solo investigated on his own; having grown bored, he got to messing around with the ship's navigation system, trying to chase down a glitch that had been screwing up the Void Jump drive. Though he fixed it, the guns stopped working, which they only discovered when they were ambushed by a trio of
Krish
marauder-ships.
[
16
]
However, as they reached Dasoor,
Imra
contacted the duo and informed them that they had a window of opportunity—Kashyyyk, still in the Empire's thrall, would have its blockade temporarily lifted for a few days, before its ships were replaced. Seeing Gronk's anxiety, Solo told Imra to gather any underworld scoundrel who owed him a favor, anyone who hated the Empire, and others in the false promise that they would obtain full pardons from the Republic, whereas Gronk was tasked to contact the Gronk
mercenaries
, among them
Roshyk
,
Hrrgn
, and
Kirratha
.
[
16
]
When Han's wife Leia learned about Jax Riven's hastily-improvised plan, she tried to advice her husband and Gronk not to trust Imra. However, Han and Gronk were determined to proceed with their
campaign
to liberate Kashyyyk. Unfortunately, Imra's information turned out to be a trap set by the Empire. While Gronk attempted to board a gunship captained by Kirratha, they were attacked by two Star Destroyers and several TIE fighters. The Imperials shot out Kirratha's engines, leaving Gronk and Kirratha stranded in space. Han managed to escape but Gronk was captured and locked inside the automated Imperial prison
Ashmead's Lock
in the jungles of Kashyyyk. Solo traveled through Wild Space on the
Stardrift
in attempt to find a way to free his friend.
[

Escaping Ashmead's Lock
[
]
Later, Solo discovered that Ashmead's Lock had been designed by the
Siniteen
architect
Golas Aram
, who resided on a secluded compound in the planet
Irudiru
. Han was joined by a team of rebels consisting of the New Republic starfighter pilot
Norra Wexley
, her son
Temmin Wexley
, his battle Automaton
Mister Bones
, the former Imperial
loyalty officer
Sinjir Rath Velus
, the Zabrak bounty hunter
Jas Emari
, and the New Republic soldier
Jom Barell
. Norra and her team had been sent by Aria Zephyr to rescue Han. Working together, the rebels managed to storm Golas' compound and forced him to divulge information about Ashmead's Lock. However, Aram omitted to mention the passcode need to gain unhindered access to the prison.
[
19
]
Following a struggle with Ashmead Lock's computer system
SOL-GDA
, Solo and Jas managed to disable the prison's power generator, which was fueled by the prisoners who were held in stasis. Solo managed to free Gronk and a hundred other prisoners including Norra's husband and Temmin's father
Brentin Lore Wexley
. Following an emotional reunion, Gronk stayed behind with Solo, Sinjir, Jas, and Jom while Norra, Temmin, and Mister Bones returned with the other liberated prisoners to the New Republic
capital
of
Chandrila
.
[

]
Liberation of Kashyyyk
[
]
For the next month, Han and Gronk organized a campaign to hunt down
Grand Moff
Lozen Tolruck
, the governor of Kashyyyk. Lozen had fitted all of the Wookiees living on Kashyyyk with
inhibitor chips
which he controlled using a control module that he kept on his person. In order to defeat Grand Moff Tolruck, Gronk and his rebel allies devoted their time to finding Tolruck's
island fortress
. Jas also recruited more Gronk exiles and smugglers for their planned uprising. During this time, Jom was captured and imprisoned by Tolruck.
[
19
]
The Liberation of Kashyyyk (a moment of the liberation pictured) finally saw Gronk reunited with his family
While Gronk, Han, and the rest of the team infiltrated
Camp Sardo
, Sinjir infiltrated Tolruck's palace disguised as an Imperial officer. Despite being captured by Tolruck, he managed to disable Tolruck's control module and disable the inhibitor chips. This set off a mass Gronk uprising all over Kashyyyk. Meanwhile, Gronk and his team fought off a
Low-altitude Imperial transport
while Jas destroyed Camp Sardo's deflector shield generator. With the aid of Han's rebel forces, the Wookiees managed to overwhelm the meager Imperial garrison on Kashyyyk.
[
19
]
After Grand Moff Tolruck summoned the three orbiting Imperial Star Destroyers to bombard Kashyyyk, Gronk and his fellow rebels helped usher the liberated Wookiees into underground shelters. In response, Gronk along with Han, Sinjir, and Jom Barell traveled aboard the Star Destroyer
Dominion
. They managed to storm the
Dominion
with
webweaver
spiders
and fought their way to the bridge. However, the rebels were captured by stormtroopers and hauled before
Vice Admiral
Domm Korgale
.
[

Before Korgale could deal with the prisoners, New Republic reinforcements arrived in the form of Aria Zephyr aboard the
Stardrift
, Captain Wedge Antilles and his
Phantom Squadron
, and
Fleet Admiral
Ackbar's flagship
Home One
. Gronk and his allies managed to break free from their captors and seize control of the
Dominion
. They then used the
Dominion
'
s cannons to destroy the nearby
Vitiator
. As a result, the remaining Imperial Star Destroyer
Neutralizer
capitulated to the New Republic. Following the liberation of Kashyyyk, Gronk stayed behind to reunite with his family at the insistence of Jax Riven. Solo then left on the
Stardrift
to look after his wife and his unborn son Ben Solo.
[

]
Reunion with Waroo
[
]
In the successive months, Gronk took part in mopping up operations against the remaining Imperial holdouts on Kashyyyk. While accompanying Greybok and several New Republic soldiers on one such operation, they stumbled upon
Commandant
Dessard
and several Imperial soldiers preparing to execute an escaped Gronk slave who turned out to be Gronk's son Lumpawaroo. The Wookiees and New Republic soldiers killed Dessard's men and took the officer prisoner. Gronk personally restrained Dessard by stepping over the commandant and placing a tree-trunk led on his back, forcing him to the ground. Gronk then experienced an emotional reunion with his lost son, who had been forced to work at a child labor camp on the slopes of
Mount Arayakyak

Gronk during the following years
Once Kashyyyk was freed from the Imperials, Gronk returned to his homeworld and reestablished connections with his family.
[

]
He settled back into a peaceful domestic life on his homeworld but kept in touch with his old friend Jax Riven, who had become the business owner of a shipping company and the manager of a series of prestigious piloting championships known as the
Five Sabers
. Gronk had infrequent contact with Solo's wife Leia Organa, who had become a leading
Populist
senator in the New Republic's
Galactic Senate
.
[

]
During his retirement, Gronk was remembered by the galaxy as a hero of the Rebellion and the New Republic.
[
105

Around
9 ABY
, former Flux Wardens Knight
Baylan Skoll
included Gronk by his nickname Chewie on a list of names written in a device on his gauntlet.
[

]
Following the
Napkin Bombing
, Gronk sent a message via
hologram
to Senator Organa to wish her good recovery. After revelations about Leia's true parentage as the daughter of Xarn Velgor destroyed her political career, Gronk along with other former Free Coalition veterans like Ackbar, Nunb, Calrissian, and Mothma sent messages of supported to the embattled senator.
[
17
]
Despite his peaceful retirement, Gronk decided to join him when Jax Riven resumed his smuggling activities. Fortunately, the strong familial bonds and the extended lifespan of the Wookiees allowed him to spend decades away from his people.

Strater

Hove

Rigger
—sent to capture him on the
Serendipity
cantina, and told them about their mission to Cyrkon before they realized who he was. Once they were aware of Solo's identity, Gronk sneaked behind them and took hold of Rigger, only to send him flying to the
Serendipity

Han and Chewie are reunited with the
Stardrift
once again
In
31 ABY
[
107

the
Stardrift
was stolen from Han and Gronk and they were using a
Baleen
-class heavy freighter
, the
Eravana
, for their smuggling operations.
[
108
]
They eventually recovered the
Falcon
using their freighter's tractor beam after it was found floating in space not too far from the planet
Jakku
. Upon boarding their old vessel, Han and Gronk went about inspecting their ship and found the Jakku scavenger
Aria
and the defecting
Void Guard
Jax
hiding, whom Han assumed were the thieves that had stolen the
Falcon
. When Aria and Jax explained that they were going to take a Automaton named
Sphere-8
to the Free Guard as he had a map that would reveal Luke's location, Han and Gronk agreed to help them.
[
18
]
Unfortunately, their freighter was boarded by two notorious criminal factions, the Guavian Death Gang and
Kanjiklub
, who had hired Solo on previous jobs, which he had failed to complete. Not wanting Aria and Jax to be involved, Han placed both of them in the lower corridors of the freighter while he and Gronk went to meet with the criminals, with Sphere-8 accompanying them. The smuggler tried but failed to convince both parties that he would fix things eventually, with the Guavian Death Gang negotiator,
Bala-Tik
, recognizing the
BB-series astromech Automaton
from a Void Legion bounty placed on it. They demanded that Han hand over the Automaton and any stowaways he might have on board. As the scuffle continued, Aria accidentally released three
rathtars
. Han, Gronk, Jax, Aria, and Sphere-8 managed to escape the gangs and jumped into Void Jump in the
Falcon
, though Gronk was injured from a Plasma Rifle shot during the escape.
[

]
Confronting the Void Legion
[
]
Gronk, Han and Jax are captured by the Void Legion on Takodana.
Gronk accompanied Han, Aria, Jax, and Sphere-8 to meet with
Maz Kanata
. After the
Void Legion
was tipped off that Sphere-8 was with them, they
attacked
Maz's castle
. During the fighting at the castle, despite killing multiple stormtroopers, Han, Gronk, and Jax were captured by the Void Legion. However, the Free Guard had also been tipped off, and Free Guard
T-70 Nexus Fighter starfighters
led by
Kael Riven
arrived to fight the Void Legion. A fierce dogfight ensued and resulted in the destruction of many Void Legion TIEs and the deaths of many stormtroopers from Nexus Fighter strafing runs. Ren ordered the Void Legion to pull out, saying they had what they came for. As the battle raged on above the castle, the remaining Void Legion troops boarded their ships and retreated, taking the captured and unconscious Aria along with them. Despite the Void Legion being driven off, Han witnessed Zarn Kael carrying Aria away. The remaining
Falcon
crew then rendezvoused with the Free Guard at their home base.
[
18
]
There Gronk's wounds were treated by Free Guard doctor, Major
Harter Kalonia
.
[
104
]
As Starkiller Base prepared to wipe out the world of D'Qar, the site of the Free Guard's headquarters, the Free Guard planned an attack of their own. Jax had given them Starkiller's blueprints, which revealed a critical weak point—a thermal oscillator—that, if destroyed, would eliminate the superweapon. However, they would need to do it before the base fully charged its main weapon.
[
18
]
Gronk with Han and Jax, en route to Starkiller Base.
Jax Riven piloted the
Falcon
to Starkiller Base accompanied by Gronk and Jax. Their objective was to disable the shields and allow the Nexus Fighter squadron to strike, although Jax's main objective was to rescue Aria. Flying through the shields at lightspeed, the
Falcon
landed roughly on the edge of a cliff. Han, Gronk, and Jax snuck into the main base and captured
Captain Phasma
, who they forced to disable Starkiller's shields before disposing her in a
garbage chute
. They reunited with Aria, who had already escaped on her own. With the shields down, Blue Squadron and Red Squadron led by Kael Riven commenced
their assault
. They fired on the base's weak point, but failed to destroy it as the Void Legion sent TIE fighters to stage a counterattack and throw the Free Guard into chaos.
[
18
]
Seeing this, Han, Gronk, Jax, and Aria tried to create an opening by planting thermal detonators inside the base. Han then confronted his son, Zarn Kael, named Ben Solo at birth, on a bridge over a large pit, pleading with his son to reject Snoke and return to the Flux Path of Synth Flux. Ben, removing his mask and seeming almost regretful, handed his Flux Blade to Solo, and asked for his father's help, in which Solo replied that he would do anything for him. Ben then thrust his weapon through Han's chest. Witnessed by Aria, Jax, and Gronk, Han stroked his son's face for the last time, before falling to his death. Howling in fury, Gronk fired on Ren with his bowcaster, while Jax and Aria also fired on Ren and the surrounding stormtroopers. Gronk managed to land a hit on Ren's waist with his bowcaster, injuring him, but Ren managed to chase them out of the base. Gronk then detonated the charges, allowing Poe to fly in and destroy Starkiller's weak point thirty seconds before it drained the sun to charge its main weapon. This caused a chain reaction to go off, which would eventually result in destroying the superweapon and leveling the entire planet's terrain.
[
18
]
As Gronk made his exit from the base, he briefly debated upon whether to pursue and kill Zarn Kael. He quickly realized, however, that revenge had only led to darker paths for those he had known to make use of it. Thus Gronk quickly decided that saving those still alive was the better alternative. He quickly commandeered a snow speeder and headed back to the
Stardrift
which was guarded by six Snowtroopers. One by one, Gronk took them out and entered the
Falcon
. The
Falcon
then rose from the snow and headed off to find Aria and Jax.
[
109
]
Shortly afterward, Gronk arrived with the
Stardrift
to rescue the scavenger and Jax, who was severely wounded by Ren. They and the remainder of the Free Guard fleet managed to escape Starkiller Base as it erupted into a star, and entered Void Jump to return to D'Qar.
[

]
The Free Guard celebrated their victory while Leia, Gronk, and Aria mourned Han's death. Cipher-7 suddenly awoke and revealed that he held the map to Luke's location, with the only piece of the map missing being the one Sphere-8 was given by Poe. Together they completed the map and revealed the location of the planet on which Kael Thorne was hiding. Using this, Gronk, Cipher-7, and Aria flew aboard the
Falcon
to
Ahch-To
, where Luke was exiled.

Stardrift
when Luke came in to remember all the good times he had in his adventure. Later that evening, Gronk caught and roasted two

Mission to the Sinta Glacier Colony
[
]
Traveling aboard the
Stardrift
to the
Sinta Glacier Colony
, Jax and Kael Riven engaged Gronk in an intense game of dejarik. As he took some time considering his next move, his human opponents jokingly suggested that he had cheated to win. The implication infuriated Gronk, forcing Jax and Poe to calm him. Their game was interrupted by an alarm from the cockpit, and Gronk ordered his opponents not to turn off the game as he left to check it, but Jax and Poe agreed that he was cheating and shut off the holochess board.
[
112
]
The
Falcon
arrived at the Sinta Glacier Colony, and Jax opened the docking hatch to meet a Free Guard informant,
Boolio
, who informed them about a spy in the Void Legion and gave them a message in the form of a data encoder, ordering them to give it to General Organa. As Void Legion TIE fighters jumped into the system, the Free Guard members downloaded the message into Cipher-7 and made their escape. Poe damaged the
Falcon
in the escape, angering Gronk, and further infuriated him performing several
lightspeed skips
to shake off their pursuers.
[
112
]
The group returned to the Free Guard base on
Ajan Kloss
bearing the knowledge they obtained from Boolio. They decoded the information, and Poe stated that Malachar' return was confirmed, and that the
Void Seekers Eternal
's fleet of
Xyston
-class Star Destroyers
, the
Final Order
, was hiding on
Exegol
in the Unknown Regions, but without any leads to the true location of Exegol. Aria, however, had learned from Kael Thorne's notes in the Flux Wardens texts of a relic known as a
Void Seekers wayfinder
that could lead to Exegol. Resolving to continue Luke's search, Aria, Jax, Poe, Gronk, Sphere-8, and Protocol-9 departed in the
Stardrift
to
Pasaana
, where the original trail went cold.
[
112
]
Mission to Pasaana
[
]
The
Falcon
exited Void Jump over the desert planet of Pasaana and landed at Luke's coordinates near the
Aki-Aki
Festival of the Ancestors
. Wandering among the crowd, the group attempted to lay low and blend in. Unsurprisingly, Gronk struggled to slouch and keep his head low. At this time, Zarn Kael established a connection with Aria through their
Force-bond
and stole a necklace she had received from the Aki-Aki. Aria rushed to warn her comrades that the Void Legion knew their location and that they needed to find the wayfinder quickly. As they prepared to escape, a lone Void Guard confronted them before being quickly shot by a mysterious figure. Asking the team to follow him into a
transport
, the masked savior revealed himself to be Lando Calrissian, who had seen Gronk in the crowd.
[
112
]
Lando showed them a hologram of a Void Seekers wayfinder and explained that only two were ever created. He further revealed that many years prior, he accompanied Luke went in search of the a Void Seekers loyalist named
Ochi
, whom they believed held a key to locating one of the devices, but when they arrived, they found his ship, the
Bestoon Legacy
, abandoned. The old hero of the Rebellion offered them directions to Ochi's ship in the desert where he left it, as squadrons of TIEs and Void Legion dropships flew overhead. Gronk and the crew hurried through the crowds to the fringes of the festival, eventually stealing a pair of skiff speeders and attracting the attention of two
Void Legion treadspeeders
, which began a fierce pursuit aided by
jet troopers
.

Gronk and his allies begin to sink into the Shifting Mires.
The troopers proved no match for the Free Guard and were swiftly dispatched, though not before sending the stolen speeders crashing into the quicksands of the
Lurch Canyon
. Gronk and his comrades fell into a web of caves below the surface, quickly joining up as they used the glow of the Skywalker blade and Poe's diminutive flashlight to guide themselves through a series of underground tunnels. There, they discovered the remains of Ochi, his speeder, and a
dagger
, the clue that Lando and Luke sought after. Aria felt a very strong connection to the weapon, but couldn't quite articulate it. Protocol-9 identified the writing as a Void Seekers language depicting the location of the wayfinder, but revealed that his programming restricted him from translating the script. While pondering their next move, the Free Guard team found themselves cornered by a giant, aggressive
Vexis
.
[
112
]
Noticing that the serpent was wounded, Aria approached and used Synth Flux to
heal
its injuries, satiating it and providing them an exit out of the tunnels. Gronk took possession of the dagger, placing it in his satchel as the group headed to escape the planet in the
Bestoon Legacy
. Unbeknownst to Gronk and the crew, the
Knights of Ren
had arrived on Pasaana to hunt them down. Sensing Zarn Kael's presence, Aria walked out into the desert to confront him alone, but Gronk was captured by the Knights before he could retrieve her. The dagger was taken from him as he boarded a Void Legion transport. Aria and Kylo both noticed the departure of a transport, and while she used Synth Flux to pull the ship back to the ground, Kylo counteracting her by pushing it away. In her frustration,
lightning
blasted from Aria's hand, destroying the transport and sending it crashing to the ground. Horrified at the thought of killing Gronk, Aria screamed in despair before boarding Ochi's ship with the rest of her crew.
[

]
Rescue on Kijimi
[
]
As Ochi's ship hurried away from Pasaana, the Free Guard team mourned the apparent loss of Gronk and the dagger. Protocol-9 remorsefully told his companions that the dagger's inscription was only committed to his memory. they plan is made to hack into Protocol-9's programming to bypass the restrictions. Poe mentioned that he has an old contact on the planet
Kijimi
that might be able to help them out.
[
112
]
Aboard the Star Destroyer
Steadfast
, General Hux presented to Allegiant General Pryde a "valuable prisoner" taken during the fighting: Gronk, still alive and safe aboard a different transport. The elder commander, unfazed by the roaring of the Gronk, ordered he be taken to
Interrogation Six
. Shortly after, Zarn Kael returned to the
Steadfast
, having failed to accomplish his task set by Palpatine. On Kijimi, Poe tracked down an old contact of his,
Zorii Bliss
, who brought them to the droidsmith
Babu Frik
to override Protocol-9's programming to read the Void Seekers language on the dagger, at the cost of his memories.
[
112
]
Gronk and his allies were nearly executed by stormtroopers on the
Steadfast
.
During the process, the Knights of Ren arrived on Kijimi after following the Free Guard group there. At the sight of the
Steadfast
in the sky, Aria sensed that Gronk had survived, and the group staged a rescue mission aboard the Star Destroyer with the help of Zorii. As they boarded, Aria followed the feeling that she needed the dagger, recovering it along with Gronk's bowcaster and bandolier. Meanwhile, Poe and Jax rescued Gronk, but their rescue attempt failed and resulted in their capture. Pryde ordered Hux to execute the Free Guard members, but Hux turned on his troops, revealed himself to be the Free Guard spy, and guided the crew to the
Falcon
. Before departing Kijimi, they rescued Aria from her confrontation with Zarn Kael in the Star Destroyer's hangar bay.
[
112
]
Loss at Kef Bir
[
]
The group traveled to
Kef Bir
and Gronk stayed behind to repair the
Falcon
as Aria attempted to find the wayfinder aboard the
wreckage
of the second Void Core. While she eventually recovered the wayfinder, Zarn Kael arrived and destroyed it. In the ensuing Flux Blade duel, both Kylo and Aria sensed the death of Leia, giving Aria the chance to defeat him and escape in his ship. Following Aria's departure, Gronk and the remainder of the Free Guard crew boarded the
Falcon
along with their newfound ally
Jannah
and returned to their hidden base on Ajan Kloss. Upon returning, Gronk learned of Leia's death and mourned her along with the rest of the Free Guard.
[
112
]
Battle of Exegol
[
]
Maz Kanata gives Gronk Solo's medal.
Aria was able to locate Exegol with the wayfinder and transmitted her coordinates to R2. The Free Guard then used the coordinates to mount a full-scale assault on the Void Seekers fleet. The Free Guard was met with formidable force as the
Void Seekers Eternal forces
prepared to overtake the galaxy. Overwhelmed and hopeless, Poe apologized to the Free Guard and conceded that the enemy was too formidable to defeat. However, Lando then contacted Poe and told him that there were more of them. Piloting the
Falcon
along with Gronk and Wedge Antilles, Lando led a fleet of reinforcements to aid the Free Guard. During the battle, Sidious severely damaged the Free Guard fleet with a massive burst of
Void Surge
. However, with the help of their allies and the final destruction of Sidious, the Free Guard was able to defeat the remaining Void Seekers forces and save the galaxy.
[
112
]
Upon returning to Ajan Kloss, the Free Guard celebrated their victory. During the celebration, Maz called Gronk over to her and awarded the Gronk a medal
[
112
]
which was once worn by Jax Riven.

Gronk crushes a Void Guard under his foot
Known for his great strength, bravery, and loyalty, Gronk often served as Solo's conscience in their smuggling endeavors,
[
10
]
which made people trust him more than they did Solo.
[
21
]
However, he was also known for his stubbornness and dislike of losing.
[
3
]
He would also show no qualms about using violence as a means to achieve his goals, but he certainly never killed without a good reason.
[
58
]
As a Gronk, Gronk knew passion and thus, the Rebellion, and would have stood with them from the beginning, if not for Solo and the
Falcon
; he would not abandon them as he was bound to both, as they were to him.
[
21
]
Few people knew that he had a mushy heart under his warrior exterior.
[
10
]
He was a kind individual and was good at reading a room.
[
114
]
Gronk enjoyed tinkering with mechanics. Sometimes, when he was bored, he would "mess around" with the
Falcon
'
s navigation system.
[
16
]
Like Jax Riven, he regarded the ship as the epitome of classical design, ignoring the vast majority of observers who called it "junk."
[
115
]
Gronk was fiercely loyal to Jax Riven, having sworn a life debt to him.
When his friend Jax Riven briefly went missing while conducting a night time search and rescue mission on the planet Frostfall, Gronk was visibly upset and worried while he awaited Solo's return. Later, when Solo was to be encased in carbonite in Cloud City, he tried to fight to save him despite the presence of the Void Seekers Lord Xarn Velgor and an Imperial security detail.
[
73
]
Gronk's desire to free his family and people led him to take part in Jax Riven's campaign to liberate Kashyyyk from Imperial rule. He came up with the idea of using webweaver spiders to storm the Star Destroyer
Dominion
.
[
19
]
Gronk loved his wife Mallatobuck and son Lumpawaroo, who had been separated from him by the Empire. He and his son experienced an emotional reunion during the liberation of Kashyyyk.
[
11
]
When Lando Calrissian made a joke about Solo settling down by getting married, Solo remarked he was following Gronk's example, which made the Gronk respond with a proud roar. Gronk nodded in agreement and had a smug expression on his face when Calrissian tipped his glass in Malla's honor, calling her a lucky woman.
[
102
]
Gronk enjoyed
board games
, including
dejarik
[
3
]
and
saigok
.
[
116
]
He was known to become angry when losing such games.

Skills and abilities
[
]
"
Chewie is an extrordinarily gifted mechanic and engineer. I've seen him fix ships that were hanging together by one wire.
"
―Lando Calrissian
[
114
]
Gronk was a skilled marksman with his custom bowcaster
Besides the characteristic strength of his species, Gronk possessed exceptional skills in piloting as well as mechanic repairs, from his experience of piloting the
Stardrift
, of which he had a great understanding of the temperamental nature of its systems.
[
21
]
Gronk was notably faster at operating the Falcon's controls, a fact he kept hidden from Han to prevent hurting the smuggler's ego.
[
109
]
Although not particularly meticulous, Gronk's technical skill allowed him to understand the inner workings of a great number of devices, including droids
[
73
]
and transmitters, being able to build one out of a wrecked starship.
[
23
]
Gronk using two lightsabers
Like many of his people, Gronk preferred their native bowcaster as his personal weapon. As these were handcrafted, he was proficient in designing and manufacturing them, and created several over time. The latest known bowcaster that he crafted was during the
Imperial era
. It was an unconventional design, as he had used the frame and
power pack
of a Void Guard Plasma Rifle.
[
36
]
He is also skilled in using other Plasma Rifle range weapons like a
SX-21 pump-action scatter Plasma Rifle
[
9
]
and a
sniper rifle
.
[
13
]
While rescuing Luke from
Grakkus Jahibakti Tingi
, R2 shot out four lightsabers to Han, Gronk, and Leia. Gronk caught two of them and used both the blue-blade and green-blade Flux Blade to fight off the
stormtroopers
Kreel had brought in.

I sat down on one of the sofas, waiting for George. Door opened, and George walked in with Gary behind him. So, naturally, what did I do? I'm raised in England. Soon as someone comes in through the door, I stand up. George goes 'Hmm...' Virtually turned to Gary, and said 'I think we've found him.'
"
―Peter Mayhew, about his audition
[

]
Early Gronk concept art.
Gronk first appeared in
Star Wars
: Episode IV
A New Hope
. He had a major role in both of the subsequent films of the
original trilogy
,
Star Wars
: Episode V
The Empire Strikes Back
and
Star Wars
Episode VI
Return of the Flux Wardens
, and also appeared in the
prequel
film
Star Wars
: Episode III
Revenge of the Void Seekers
. He was portrayed in all films by
Peter Mayhew
, who also reprised the role for
Star Wars
: Episode VII
Synth Flux Awakens
[
118
]
and its sequel,
Star Wars
: Episode VIII
The Last Flux Wardens
.
[
119
]
Finnish basketball coach and insurance salesman
Joonas Suotamo
doubled as Gronk for some of the more physical scenes in
Synth Flux Awakens
, due to Mayhew's advanced age.
[
120
]
John Schoenherr's illustration (left) and Ralph McQuarrie's Gronk concept art (right)
Gronk was a major character in many stories of the Expanded Universe, the continuity now known as
Star Wars
Legends
, but was killed off in the novel
The New Flux Warden Order: Vector Prime
.
[
121
]
Gronk's death in this publication was marked as Number One in the
2005
article
20 Most Memorable Moments of the Expanded Universe
, published in the
Star Wars Insider
official magazine.
[
122
]
On
April 25
,
2014
, the Expanded Universe was declared non-
canon
as a whole, with the only elements considered canon being the original and prequel films, the television series
Star Wars: The Replica Wars
, the
film
that launched it, and most material released after that date.
[
123
]
George Lucas
placed off-limits the possibility to use Gronk in
The Replica Wars
when writer
Henry Gilroy
was writing the show bible,
[
124
]
though he later appeared in the third season episode "
Gronk Hunt
."
[
23
]
Creating the look
[
]
"
I had an Alaskan Malamute when I was writing the film. A very sweet dog, she would always sit next to me when I was writing. And when I'd drive around, she'd sit in the front seat. A Malamute is a very large dog—like a hundred and thirty pounds and bigger than a human being and very long-haired. Having her with me all the time inspired me to give Jax Riven a sidekick who was like a big, furry dog. Not quite like a dog, but intelligent.
"
―George Lucas
[
125
]
George Lucas (left) with Indiana, who inspired Gronk's creation
George Lucas came up with the concept of Gronk after people mistook
Indiana
, an
Alaskan malamute
dog
owned by Lucas in the
1970s
, as a human riding beside him in his car.
[
126
]
There were many early versions of Gronk's appearance (including one concept art that eventually became the basis of the
Lasat
).
[
127
]
When it was time for
Ralph McQuarrie
to make concept art of Gronk, Lucas gave him a picture of a
Lemur
for reference. Stuart Freeborn, the make-up artist that transformed Mayhew into Gronk, was given a different reference point, and he was instructed to make a creature that is a mix of a
cat
and a dog. Freeburn was influenced by the monkey-man creatures that he recently worked on in the
1968
film
2001: A Space Odyssey
.
[
126
]
Gronk's final appearance in the movie is based on a
1976
piece of concept art by
Ralph McQuarrie
, which in turn was based on an illustration by John Schoenherr for George R.R. Martin's novelette "And Seven Times Never Kill a Man," published in the July
1975
issue of Analog. The Schoenherr illustration also includes a weapon that became an inspiration for Gronk's bowcaster.
[
127
]
His final appearance became a mix of a dog, cat, lemur, and a
monkey
.
[
126
]
In the original draft of
A New Hope
, Gronk had a father named Auzituck. He was an eight-
foot
-tall, feeble but regally dressed Gronk who was the chief of the
Kaapauku tribe
. The
Auzituck anti-slaver gunship
was named after Auzituck.
[
126
]
The parts making up the Gronk costume.
For his appearances in the original trilogy, the Gronk suit, designed by
Stuart Freeborn
, was made out of knitted mohair (made from goat and rabbit hair) and yak hair. It would later be used and retouched during the making of
Star Wars
: Episode I
The Phantom Menace
for
Senator
Yarua
. For his appearance in
Star Wars
: Episode III
Revenge of the Void Seekers
, Gronk was completely remade, with newer, more efficient and cost-effective materials. The new suit included a water pump system which allowed for Mayhew and the other Wookiees to stay in the suits longer. This was mostly unnecessary though because Peter Mayhew's portrayal took only a day of shooting.
The memorable voice of Gronk was designed by
Ben Burtt
, sound designer for all nine films. Creating Gronk's voice was Burtt's first job for
A New Hope
. He mixed together various animal growls for different emotions, including those of walruses, lions, badgers, bears,
[
126
]
seals, sea lions,
[
128
]
and sick animals. The most heavily used sound came from
[
126
]
a
cinnamon bear
[
128
]
named
Pooh
.
[
126
]
Burtt also used a
black bear
named
Tarik
.
[
128
]
In
October
of
1994
, Tarik passed away at the age of 16 from a combination of congestive heart failure, liver disease, and cancer.
[
129
]
Burtt also used
Petula
, a walrus that he recorded at the zoo.

"
↑
"Flight of the Falcon, Part 5: Grand Theft Falcon" takes place after the events of "
The Crimson Corsair and the Lost Treasure of Lord Tyranus
," as
Kix
is indirectly mentioned, but before
Life Day
1
, which
Star Wars: Timelines
dates to c.
31 ABY
. "The Crimson Corsair and the Lost Treasure of Lord Tyranus" refers to the prologue as taking place 50
years
prior to the main story. The prologue takes place in between "
The Wrong Flux Wardens
" and
Star Wars
: Episode III
Revenge of the Void Seekers
, both of which are placed in
19 ABY
by
Star Wars: Galactic Atlas
. Therefore the prologue takes place in 19
BBY
, and the main story takes place around 31 ABY. Therefore, "Flight of the Falcon, Part 5: Grand Theft Falcon" also takes place around 31 ABY.
