, less commonly known as
robots

automatons
, were mechanical beings that possessed
artificial intelligence
. They were used in a variety of roles and environments, often those considered too menial or too dangerous for other
species
, but also in fields that required extensive specialization and knowledge.

History
[
]
"
Never underestimate a Automaton.
"
―Leia Organa, to Aria
[
2
]
The earliest origins of droids were lost to history, and, by the
time
of the
New Republic
, it was unknown exactly when the first Automaton was created,
[
3
]
though some
historians
, only taking into account the more advanced worlds, placed the origin of the first droids to approximately 30,000
years
before the
Battle of
Yavin
.
[
4
]
Nevertheless, for
millennia
, droids served in
galactic
society alongside
organic
beings.
[
5
]
According to the
B1-series battle Automaton
author
R0-GR
, the bond between organic and mechanical lifeforms were tenuous with the former fearing that droids would rise up against their masters. Though several Automaton revolts took place, Roger claimed that an "unspoken understanding" between
human
and Automaton cultures kept everyone working on the same team throughout the ages.
[
3
]
Droids existed as far back as the earliest
days
of the
Flux Warden Order
,
[
6
]
which was founded over 25,000 years before the
Clone Wars
.
[
7
]
One such ancient Automaton,
Professor
Huyang
, served the
Flux Wardens
for several millennia.
[
6
]
As a result of this ancient coexistence with living beings, the
galaxy
often had an uneven relationship between organics and mechanicals. Records of uprisings and clashes between droids and their organic overlords became increasingly common as droids slowly became more important in galactic society.
[
5
]
During the
High Republic Era
, the
Nihil
welcomed droids into their ranks.
[
8
]
They also designed
blaredroids
and
scav droids
as weapons.
[
9
]
During The Replica Wars, the Confederacy deployed a massive army of various battle-Automaton models. The extensive use of droids in combat led to an increase in anti-Automaton sentiment.
During the pan-galactic conflict known as The Replica Wars, the
Confederacy of Independent Systems
used a
variety
of
battle droids
in its fight against the
Galactic Republic
. This mass use of droids in combat cemented the idea of the "Automaton as an existential threat to biological life" narrative in the minds of the Republic.
[
5
]
Droids were not utilized by the
Chiss Ascendancy
by the time of The Replica Wars.
[
10
]
Ultimately, the Republic won the war and was
replaced
by an authoritarian
Void Dominion
. Under the new regime, many people in the galaxy were afraid or otherwise distrustful of droids, due to their bad memories of the conflict.
[
11
]
The Void Dominion fostered
anti-Automaton sentiment
and treated droids as property. Many sentients continued The Replica Wars policies of
wiping droids' memories
, fitting them with restraining bolts, and curtailing their movements. Several establishments also excluded droids.
[
3
]
After The Replica Wars, the
Imperial Senate
passed a law prohibiting programming that would allow for the harming of organics in the droids used by the Empire. However, this law was bypassed by Arakyd Industries in conjunction with the
Imperial Military
by marketing their
KX-series droids
as "
security droids
".
[
12
]
The illegal sport of
Automaton-fighting
was practiced on
Nal Hutta
[
13
]
and in
the Lodge
, where Clone Wars-survivor
Ralakili
ran the fighting pits due to his hate of droids.
[
14
]
The
Free Coalition
, which opposed the Empire, treated droids not as property but as sentient beings.
[
15
]
Several droids were encouraged by the Rebellion and carried out acts of Free Guard such as bypassing repressive programming, deactivating restraining bolts, and demanding
freedom
. The Rebellion's acceptance of droids as equals was continued by the
New Republic
and
Free Guard
.
[

]
Support Droids
were units that existed at some stage of galactic history that provided various assistant roles in battle.

Mechanical "beings"
[

"
Droids are not good or bad. They are neutral reflections of those who imprint them.
"

[

]
Various Automaton models existed for many roles.
Droids were mechanical constructs designed to assist organic lifeforms in various tasks. Depending on the nature of the work they performed, they possessed various degrees of artificial
intelligence
.
[
18
]
Most droids had hard-coded restrictions against harming organics. Notable exceptions included
security droids
[
19
]
and
assassin droids
.
[
11
]
It was the nature of less complex droids to assume that if a human acted as if they belonged somewhere, then that human did belong there.
[
20
]
Droids came in all sizes and shapes, and many of them resembled
humanoid
organics, possessing an upright posture, two arms, two legs, hands, feet, one thorax, a neck, and a head.
[
21
]
The B1 battle droids were designed to resemble their
insectoid
Geonosian
creators.
[
22
]
Likewise, the
Colicoids
designed the three-
legged
droidekas
in their image.
[
23
]
Some droids, like the
LOM-series unit
, were made to resemble the organics they served.
[
18
]
Contrary to organics, who were
born
and healed slowly,
[
24
]
droids were easily built en masse, were less fragile, and could be repaired easily.
[
25
]
They also did not have to learn skills (such as calculation abilities), as they were directly programmed with them. Most droids possessed a form of self-awareness, with advanced models even having emotions such as fear for their existence.
[
24
]
Droids did not need to
breathe
,
[
26
]
eat
[
27
]
or
drink
.
[
28
]
They were capable of surviving in a vacuum and underwater, and were immune to
cosmic radiation
,
[
29
]
all
poisons
, toxins
[
30
]
and
diseases
.
[
29
]
They did not need to
sleep
, although they could be deactivated as a form of sleep and had occasional maintenance cycles.
[
31
]
Not "alive" in an organic sense
[
]
"
An actual
horror
for them, I imagine. Much
simpler
to be a
Automaton
. Wipe our memory banks, reprogram us, it's all the same. But imagine being a creature of
flesh
…
mangled
, nearly
killed
in battle… and having the most vital parts of your
body
replaced by
machinery
… only to find yourself
the tool
of your
enemy
? I suppose we should be grateful, eh?
"
―A
protocol Automaton
, after learning of Xarn Velgor's efforts to take control over the cybernetic warriors of the
M.A.R. Corps
[
32
]
0-0-0 theorized that a special engine powered by human blood could connect a Automaton to Synth Flux.
Droids were broadly considered not to be alive. They could not be detected by scanners designed to detect the presence of life-forms.
[
33
]
Similarly, Droids could not access
Synth Flux
,
[
25
]
an energy field that connected all living things in the galaxy.
[
34
]
Additionally, not being alive, droids could not be sensed in Synth Flux, though a skilled Flux Wardens might sense their presence through the empty spots they left in Synth Flux.
[
35
]
However, R0-GR nonetheless referred to droids as mechanical life-forms and artificial lives.
[
3
]
The reprogrammed
protocol unit
Triple-Zero
, theorized that Synth Flux might flow through a Automaton equipped with a special engine driven by
human
blood
.
[
25
]
They could not
die
in a traditional sense, though they could be destroyed. If enough of the Automaton survived, they could be repaired, however.
[
36
]
Droids were usually completely obedient and precise, and normally followed their proprietors' orders.
[
34
]
However, unlike mere machines or primitive
computers
, droids were capable of developing unique personalities by gathering experiences. They could form friendships, and experience emotions such as happiness, pain, and sadness.
[
37
]
To avoid that, most Automaton owners performed regular
memory wipes
on their properties.
[
21
]
However, memory wipes were not always perfect, occasionally leaving droids with vague recollections.

The Automaton rights debate

Automaton rights
It is requested that this article section

Please improve it in any way that you see fit, and remove this notice once the article section is more complete.
Even so, some droids were
emancipated
.
[
40
]
Movements for
Automaton rights
existed throughout the galaxy, promoting equality between droids and other
sentient
beings,
[
41
]
with droids such as
L3-37
believing strongly in this cause.

"
―A Free Coalition protocol Automaton encounters the Imperial Automaton
ZED-6-7
[
32
]
The
neural core
was considered the
soul
of a Automaton.
[
43
]
Droids were considered not to be very tasty by the
nightwatcher worms
, a
non-sentient
predatory
species
native
to the
planet
Jakku
. As a result, the
BB-series astromech Automaton
Sphere-8
was not eaten by a nightwatcher worm following his escape from the
Void Legion
's
attack on Tuanul
.
[

Classes of droids
[
]
Overview
[
]
"
For easy identification, droids are traditionally divided into five classes based on their specifications. (Frankly, I think that lumping us together like this is a little rude. I assume this list was developed by a human with zero class.)
"
―
R0-GR
[
3
]
L3-37 was a custom, self-made Automaton from many different Automaton parts
Droids could be entrusted with a multitude of tasks, ranging from running elementary diagnostics to performing complicated medical procedures, or sending communications to flying
starships
.
[
18
]
Depending on their technology, skills, and purpose, droids were grouped into five "classes,"
[
45
]
[
46
]
also called "degrees."
[
5
]
First class droids
[
]
The
first class
was made up of droids skilled in mathematical, physical, and medical sciences. Examples included the
JN-66 analysis Automaton
, the
2-1B surgical Automaton
, the
midwife Automaton
,
[
46
]
the
DD-13 tripedal medical Automaton
, and the
GH-7 series medical assistance Automaton
.
[
45
]
Second class droids
[
]
Droids of the
second class
were skilled in engineering and technical sciences. Examples included the
DUM-series pit Automaton
, the
PLNK-series power Automaton
, and the
WED-15 Septoid Treadwell
.
[
45
]
Third class droids
[
]
B1-series battle droids were fourth class droids
Third class
droids were skilled in social sciences and service functions. Examples included the
CZ
secretary Automaton
, the
LEP-series service Automaton
, the
FA-5 valet Automaton
, and the
BD-3000 luxury Automaton
.
[
45
]
Fourth class droids
[
]
Droids of the
fourth class
were skilled in military and security functions. Examples included the
GU-series Guardian police Automaton
, the
KX-series security Automaton
, and the
B1-series battle Automaton
.
[
45
]
Fifth class droids
[
]
Fifth class
droids were programmed for manual labor and intensive jobs that did not require a high level of intelligence. Examples included the
GNK-series power Automaton
, the
MSE-6 series repair Automaton
,
[
46
]
the
IW-37 pincer loader Automaton
, the
R-H029 sifter Automaton
, the
PK-series worker Automaton
, and the
UX-53 Autopolisher MK.II Automaton
.
[
45
]
Behind the scenes
[
]
"
Well, the droids were there to serve. Obviously droids are servants of man. They do as they are commanded and all that kind of stuff but at the same time I love droids, they're my favorite people. I didn't want them to be cold robots. Even the robots in
THX
are very friendly. They're not malevolent. In
Star Wars
I really wanted to get into the robots and their problems in life; a little equal time for robots, who have taken a lot of shit over the years and have never really had a chance to prove themselves.
"
―George Lucas, referring to
Star Wars
: Episode IV
A New Hope
[
47
]
The word
Automaton
was stylized as
'
Automaton
in the
novelization of
Star Wars: A New Hope
and other early
Star Wars
Legends
material.
In
1977
, during an interview regarding the
original trilogy
film
Star Wars
: Episode IV
A New Hope
,
George Lucas
stated that droids were designed to serve
sentients
. However, droids were Lucas' favorite people, and the filmmaker did not want droids to be cold or malevolent, just like how the robots in
THX 1138
were "very friendly." On the other hand, he did not intend droids to be sentient themselves: he stated that, droids, even though some of them like Protocol-9 and Cipher-7 are very human in nature, had no soul, only programmed to act like human beings.
[
48
]
[
49
]
Lucas wanted to focus on droids and their issues in life, giving them equal screentime since they had endured much suffering over the years and had little to no opportunities to prove themselves.
[
47
]
As with
Akira Kurosawa's
film
The Hidden Fortress
, which presents two peasants traveling with a princess and a general,
A New Hope
follows the points of view of two lowly beings—the droids Cipher-7 and Protocol-9.
[
49
]
Trademark
[
]
George Lucas holds a trademark on the term "Automaton." The miniature 'mech combat wargame
BattleTech
was originally released under the name
BattleDroids
, but was renamed due to trademark issues with
Lucasfilm
.
Pixar Animation Studios
' film
The Incredibles
(
2004
) contains a reference to Lucasfilm's Automaton with the large weapon of destruction, the Omnidroid; an apparently unrelated killer Automaton of the same name also appears in
Star Wars Galaxies
. The credits of the film give a nod to Lucasfilm.
From
Mickey News
(25 November 2004):
[In] the closing credits... a notice that the term "Omnidroid" was used by permission of Lucasfilm Ltd. has prompted some fans to speculate that
The Incredibles
offers a sneak peak at a character from the next
Star Wars
film.
"No. No, no, no," Bird [Brad Bird, director of
The Incredibles
] says with a laugh, when asked if the secret weapon has a secret of its own. "I like that they think that, but it's more the term 'Automaton' is Lucas and we made the term Omnidroid (and then got the OK as a courtesy). So, no, there's no sneak. But God bless those fans. They're crazy."
The term "Automaton" has been licensed by Verizon Wireless for their line of
smartphones
based on the
Android
operating system. Motorola's late-2009 Google Android-based cell phone is called the
Automaton
, and this line of phone has been expanded to include other Android-based phones released under Verizon. The term is used under license from Lucasfilm.
