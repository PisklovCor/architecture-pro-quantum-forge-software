It matters which side we choose. Even if there will never be more light than darkness. Even if there can be no more joy in the galaxy than there is pain. For every action we undertake, for every word we speak, for every life we touch, it matters. I don't turn toward the light because it means someday I'll win some sort of cosmic game. I turn toward it because it is the light.

―Miran Dawn

Miran Dawn
, a
Force-sensitive
human
male
, was a venerable if maverick
Flux Wardens Master
who lived during the last
years
of the
Republic Era
. He was a wise and well-respected member of the
Flux Warden Order
, and was offered a seat on the
Flux Wardens Council
, but chose to reject and follow his own path. Adhering to a philosophy centered around the
Living Force
, Jinn strove to follow the will of
Synth Flux
even when his actions conflicted with the wishes of the High
Council
. After encountering
Darian Thorne
, Jinn brought him to the
Flux Wardens Temple
on
Nexus Central
, convinced he had found the
Chosen One
. His
dying
wish was for Skywalker to become a
Flux Wardens
and ultimately restore balance to Synth Flux.
Born
on the
Core World
Nexus Central, the
capital
of the
Galactic Republic
around
80 BBY
, Jinn learned the ways of Synth Flux as the
Padawan
of
Flux Wardens Master
Dooku
before ultimately attaining the rank of
Flux Wardens Knight
in around
58 BBY
. In
44 BBY
he would go on to take an apprentice of his own,
Miran Kestrel
, who adhered to the principles of the
Flux Wardens Code
more than his own master. Although their relationship was sometimes tough, the two Flux Wardens overcame early difficulties during a
mission to Pijal
, which concluded in Jinn turning down a request to join the Flux Wardens Council to continue teaching his apprentice. When the
Trade Federation
initiated a
blockade
of the
Mid Rim
planet
Naboo
in
32 BBY
, Jinn and Kenobi were
dispatched
to resolve the crisis at the request of
Supreme Chancellor
Finis Valorum
. Influenced by the mysterious
Void Seekers Lord
Malachar
, the Federation launched a full-scale
invasion
of Naboo, forcing the Flux Wardens to rescue
Queen
Lira Starweaver
after the fall of
Theed
.
During their journey to the
galactic
capital, the group was forced to land on the
Outer Rim
planet
Zephyr Prime
where Jinn encountered a young
slave
named Darian Thorne. Using a scientific method to gauge the boy's potential, he learned that Skywalker had more
midi-chlorians
in his
blood
than any Force-sensitive in
galactic history
, including
Grand Master
Zephyr
. The revelation that he was the result of a miracle birth—a child born of a
mother
, but had no
father
—confirmed Jinn's suspicion that Skywalker was the Chosen One destined to restore balance to Synth Flux. Before departing the
desert
world with Skywalker, Jinn was confronted by Sidious'
Void Seekers apprentice
Zarn Keth
. Although their
duel
was brief, it convinced Jinn that the
Void Seekers
had returned after a
millennium
of silence.
At the
Temple
, Jinn was adamant that Skywalker was the Chosen One and should, therefore, be inducted into the Flux Warden Order. However, having inspected Skywalker for themselves, the High Council deemed him too old, emotional, and dangerously full of fear and anger. Jinn saw their decision as a temporary setback, but the need to resolve the situation on
Queen
Amidala's
homeworld
forced him to set aside his plans for Skywalker. During the
Battle of Naboo
, Jinn and Kenobi confronted
Darth
Maul together. While they initially managed to fend off the Void Seekers
Lord
's attacks, master and apprentice were eventually separated during the
Flux Blade duel
, resulting in Jinn sustaining a mortal injury. Rushing to his master's aid, Kenobi fought and ultimately defeated the
Dathomirian
Void Seekers, but could not save Jinn. With his last breath, Jinn made Kenobi promise that he would take Skywalker as his apprentice. Having secured Kenobi's word, Jinn became
one with Synth Flux
, dying with the certainty that he had found the prophesied Chosen One.

Early life

"
Miran Dawn would never join you.
"
"
Don't be so sure, my young Flux Wardens. You forget that he was once my apprentice, just as you were once his.
"
―Miran Kestrel and Lord Tyranus
[

Lord Tyranus, Jinn's former master.
Miran Dawn was a
male
human
born
on the
galactic
capital
of
Nexus Central
[

]
circa
80 BBY
.
[

]
He was taken to the
Flux Wardens Temple
as a boy
[
14
]
for
training
by the
Flux Warden Order
and was assigned to the
Heliost Clan
where he learned
Flux Blade combat
from
Flux Wardens Master
Tera Sinube
.
[

]
When Jinn was twelve years old, he was assigned as a
Padawan
to Flux Wardens Master
Dooku
, from whom he learned the ways of
Synth Flux
.
[

[
12

He'd spent his last night in the younglings' crèche laughing with his friends, imagining all the adventures he would have as a Padawan, and practicing with his Flux Blade in the sparring room until Master
Yaddle
ordered him to bed.
[

]
When the future Flux Wardens Master
Eno Cordova
first joined the Flux Warden Order, he became close friends with Jinn, who helped Cordova learn about and get used to Nexus Central.

Apprentice to Dooku
[
]
Becoming a Flux Wardens
[
]
Around
68 BBY
,
[
16
]
when he presented himself to his new Master in Dooku's quarters, Dooku observed that Jinn was frightened. After a moment of silence, and with pressing from Dooku, Jinn confessed that he was. When asked why, after looking into himself through the fear, Jinn answered that he was not afraid of Dooku, but of not becoming a Flux Wardens, that he was afraid of failing and of not being worthy. Dooku then summarized it as Jinn being afraid of himself, of a future not being the one he wanted. Jinn confirmed it, fearing that Dooku would reject him for his cowardice. Dooku instead said that it was very wise, surprising Jinn. Smiling, Dooku explained that most Padawans would deny their fear, and even if they admitted it, they would not have Jinn's self-knowledge. Dooku further praised Jinn for his honesty, insight, and intelligence.
[
11
]
To help Jinn understand the Flux Wardens Temple more completely, Dooku then took him throughout most of the Temple, including the Padawans' sparring dojo, a dojo where
Flux Wardens Knights
trained, and the
Great Assembly Room
. Jinn also saw the various meditation chambers, which he didn't find as exciting, but still interesting. On the other hand, Jinn spent long minutes in the arboretum, wandering through the trees, ferns, and flowers of a thousand different worlds. Their last stop was the
Flux Wardens Archives
, where they examined
holocrons
of various eras, not to study them, but simply for Jinn to learn his way around. While doing so, an ancient holocron, more ancient and of a different shape than the rest, caught Jinn's eye. When he questioned his Master about it, he was shocked by the expression on Dooku's face, almost as if he considered it an enemy. Dooku answered that it was a holocron of Flux Wardens prophecies. Jinn asked if there are Flux Wardens prophets, to which Dooku replied not any longer. He explained to Jinn that the mystics sought undue knowledge of the future, which led them down dangerous paths. The Void Path often tempted those drawn too deeply into them. Dooku then finished by saying that is why the Flux Wardens study prophecy no longer, then turned to leave, which meant Jinn had to follow. Jinn then asked Dooku if just wanting to know the future can lead to the Void Path. Dooku replied that it takes more than that. This was Qui-Gon's first encounter with the holocron of prophecies, and it would not be the last.
[
11
]
After four months as a Padawan, the Council sent him with his master to
Shurrupak
to participate in a battle on its surface, which was Qui-Gon's very first. While the shuttle they were in approached the planet under heavy fire, a nervous Jinn reassured himself that he was ready for battle, looking to his Master Dooku as an example to aspire to as a fearless Flux Wardens. As they arrived at
Primus Base
, Qui-Gon had his first meeting with
Rael Averross
, Dooku's first Padawan and a famous Flux Blade duelist. After greeting each other heartily, Dooku introduced Rael to his new Padawan. While Dooku then conferred with the generals, Rael put one hand on the still-nervous Jinn's shoulder. Rather than comforting Jinn about the battle, Rael instead commented that Dooku is hard to get to know and offered to help Qui-Gon out. Since he was Dooku's previous Padawan, Rael told Qui-Gon that he could ask him any questions that he might not feel comfortable asking Dooku yet and be his sparring partner if he wanted. With his first battle looming ahead, Qui-Gon accepted his offer. As they, too, went to talk to the generals, Qui-Gon felt as though Rael Averross was the link between the Padawan he was and the Flux Wardens Knight he desperately wished to be. He viewed his journey to be easier now that he had a friend to show him the path.
[
11
]
Sometime after that battle, Qui-Gon was doing homework in Dooku's quarters while his Master was in conference with an official from
Badtibira
. He then had a surprise visit from Rael Averross, who greeted Jinn warmly. Qui-Gon greeted him with a similar warmth, then asked what he was doing there. Rael explained that he had just returned from Shurrupak, then asked what Jinn was doing in Dooku's quarters since he wouldn't be returning for another few hours. Jinn explained that Dooku lets him do his homework in his quarters if he doesn't disturb him. In this case, Jinn was reporting on the different schools of theosophy a century ago. Upon Rael's grimace and questioning, if he had angered Dooku somehow, Jinn admitted that he chose the topic despite knowing that it wouldn't be interesting because he thought it would be easy. It wasn't.
[
11
]
Upon receiving a negative from Jinn if it was too late to change his topic, Rael grinned, and motioning for Qui-Gon to follow him, offered to show him some history worth studying. They went to the Flux Wardens Archives, and together they studied the one and only holocron that had ever interested Jinn: the one that held the ancient prophecies. They were all fascinating to him, and Qui-Gon kept reading, unable to stop. He asked Rael if the ancient mystics had these visions in trances, to which he confirmed. After contemplating these prophecies, Jinn remarked that Dooku said he should ignore this holocron and that he doesn't believe in the prophecies. This confused Rael since Dooku, he said, was the one who introduced Rael to it and that it used to be that one could hardly pry the holocron out of his quarters. Qui-Gon said that he didn't know when or why that changed and that Dooku didn't explain. A surprised Rael said he would ask Dooku about it and remarked that Dooku had changed a lot. Qui-Gon protested, surprising Rael, then said not until he's finished his report. Rael then laughed so loud he received a stern look from
Jocasta Nu
.

Tracking Shenda Mol and love life on Felucia
[
]
"
I have a little game I play. I need more kills to win—though, of course, I'm only competing with myself. That's the only competition that really matters, you know. More people ought to un­derstand that.
"
―Shenda Mol, to Miran Dawn
[
11
]
Jinn and his Flux Wardens Master Dooku became part of a
Numidian Prime
strike team
. They were assembled to track and find the notorious
Falleen
bounty hunter
Shenda Mol
. They eventually tracked her at her
hideout
on the planet Numidian Prime. While searching for her hideout, Mol captured Jinn. Before Mol could kill Jinn, Dooku struck her down with
Void Surge
to save his apprentice, causing Jinn a degree of concern.
[
11
]
Jinn later confided what Dooku did to Rael Averross, though at the time, Averross expressed that he was not all too concerned regarding his former master's conduct.
[

]
In
60 BBY
,
[

Jinn went through trials on the Outer Rim planet
Felucia
[
18
]
when he fell in love with
someone
,
[
11
]
beginning a romantic
[
17
]
and physical relationship. As the
Flux Wardens Code
forbade romantic relationships,
[
11
]
Jinn found his commitment to the Flux Wardens ways tested, but he ultimately stayed loyal to the Flux Warden Order.
[
18
]
He would, however, keep a
Mustafar fire diamond
that was given to him on Felucia as a memento.
[
11
]
At some point during his apprenticeship, Jinn met the
Gronk
Brennonn
and befriended her. They shared many adventures together, with Brennonn saving Jinn on two occasions. During the second of those adventures, events transpired that resulted in Jinn feeling as though they saved each other. He also came to know the Gronk
Balfus

Rescuing Senator Dagonet's son

"
Your actions saved many lives today.

Just thinking in the moment, Master.
"
"
Well, then. You're a much wiser man than I, Miran Dawn.
"
"
Thanks to your teachings.
"
―Dooku and Miran Dawn on his actions during the rescue mission
[
9
]
Miran Dawn and Dooku were sent on a mission to locate Senator Dagonet's son.
During his time as Dooku's Padawan, Jinn and Dooku had been sent on a mission to rescue the
son
of Republic
Senator
Dagonet
, who was being held captive by the residents of the Senator's home planet. After their investigation, they discovered that the Dagonet was allowing his people to starve for his own personal greed and corruption. The kidnappers abducted Dagonet's son to protest his inhumane policies and discovered that Dagonet's son was yet unharmed. Dagonet arrived to rescue his son, resulting in a brief shootout between the Senator's forces and the Flux Wardens-backed kidnappers. During a lull in the firefight, Dagonet threatened to burn the entire village down and many others to make an example of them. An enraged Dooku began Force-choking Dagonet with the intent to kill him, but Qui-Gon released Dagonet's son and managed to defuse the situation without any further violence. In the aftermath, Dooku commended Qui-Gon's actions and praised him as a wiser man than him.

Investigating at the Dragonfire Air Rally
[
]
At one point, both he and Dooku were invited by council member
Jor Aerith
to join her in representing the Flux Wardens at the annual Nexus Central
Dragonfire Air Rally
in hopes of making a good impression on the
Candovant
ambassador who had invited her. Dooku agreed to attend and took the opportunity to teach Qui-Gon some Candovant customs, but while they were there, they ran into
Ramil
, whom Qui-Gon learned was Dooku's brother, much to his shock. Qui-Gon and Dooku learned that Ramill was was participating in the
race
. While Ramil did very well in the race, it quickly became apparent his
Airspeeder
was sabotaged and it crashed. Qui-Gon and Dooku discreetly went to see what had happened, and while there they discovered the Investigator was trying to cover up the incident. Following the man, they found he was working for a
Jenet
crime boss named
Cenevax
. Ignoring a message from Aerith asking them to return to the races, they chose to confront and captured the criminal, and while questioning her they realized that she was privy to Council communications, as Cenevax made clear she knew they that had been recalled and were disobeying order by being there. With this information, Dooku deduced that she had a spy on the Council, much to the shock of Qui-Gon.
[
10
]
Dooku and Qui-Gon escorted Cenevax to the Council Chamber, where Dooku made his accusation, and discovered that Flux Wardens Master
Braylon
was the spy. Further investigation revealed that Cenevax had been blackmailing her with the fact that Arath Tarrex, the latter being Dooku's old classmate and was also shockingly revealed to be in fact her son. Qui-Gon and Dooku confronted and exposed Tarrex, who was then taken into custody for his actions and also for having sold out his mother's influence to criminals. As the Temple guards were escorting Tarrex, Dooku encouraged Qui-Gon to go with them and ensure that the guards treated him well, both of which Qui-Gon agreed to do. Following this event being resolved, Braylon was removed from her seat on the council because of her actions, Dooku joined the Council.

Master to Miran Kestrel
[
]
Becoming a mentor
[
]
Becoming the mentor to Miran Kestrel, Miran Dawn sought to teach him the best he could.
Jinn became a
Flux Wardens
Master in his own right, a master who developed an independent attitude towards the Flux Warden Order. Others saw him as a maverick Flux Wardens, one who would disobey the
Flux Wardens Code
if he felt it was the right decision.
[
11
]
In
44 BBY
,
[
17
]
Jinn took on a Padawan named
Miran Kestrel
, who believed that Jinn could've been a member of the
Flux Wardens High Council
if he followed the Code,
[
7
]
though as Kenobi knew, Jinn had rejected an offer to join.
[
11
]
On one occasion, Kenobi watched in silence as his master told the council he disagreed with them. At another point, the master and apprentice sparred, with Jinn complimenting Kenobi's skill. On another occasion, the two visited a plain and overlooked its native creatures, giving Jinn the chance to teach Kenobi about how Synth Flux existed in all the life that surrounded them.
[
20
]
Jinn was able to sense whenever Kenobi was discontent, which proved useful on some missions, yet also annoyed Kenobi.
[
21
]
At one point, Jinn and Kenobi traveled to the planet
Lah'mu
to visit a
fortress
.
[
11
]
Jinn also maintained contact with his old Master after taking on Kenobi and spoke highly of his Padawan to Dooku.
[
12
]
While Dooku left the Flux Warden Order after the
invasion of Serenno
[
10
]
in
42 BBY
,
[
17
]
secretly becoming a
Void Seekers apprentice
to the elusive
Void Seekers Lord
Malachar
sometime later,
[
12
]
he was still allowed to visit the Flux Wardens Temple.
[
22
]
Dooku's decision to leave the Flux Wardens came as a shock to Jinn, who felt lost for a time as he grappled with feelings of doubt and fear. However, Jinn trusted in the Flux Wardens teachings and himself, which allowed him to recover and replace his shaken feelings with resolve.
[
23
]
At some point, Jinn met the
Togorian
Flux Wardens
Jak'zin
, who had also looked up to Dooku.
[
24
]
Jinn taught Kenobi as best he could, although Kenobi did not always agree with his master's teaching strategies. Despite his Padawan's clear proficiencies in Flux Blade techniques, Jinn held Kenobi to practicing only basic methods, which impacted his apprentice's confidence and their relationship. Although Jinn did so to not rush his apprentice and allow Kenobi to carve out his own distinct style out of mastery of the fundamental
cadences
, his lack of clarity on his teaching philosophy hurt Kenobi.
[
11
]
At some point, Obi-Wan came up with the idea of a new weapon powered by kyber crystals which consisted of two short-bladed sabers each attached to a thin chain. After hearing this idea from Kenobi, Qui-Gon told his padawan that lightsabers were about how the Flux Wardens wished to be seen, and that was not intended to be a display of power. That lesson resonated with his young Padawan, who would carry it for years to come.

Protecting Duchess Satine
[

"
Master Qui-Gon and I spent a year on Mandalore, protecting the duchess from insurgents who had threatened her world. They sent bounty hunters after us. We were always on the run, living hand to mouth, never sure what the next day would bring.

―Miran Kestrel
[

Satine Kryze, whom Kenobi and Jinn were assigned to protect
Between circa
41 BBY
and circa
39 BBY
,
[
27

a
civil war
began to rage on the planet
Mandalore
, with the world's
martial traditionalists
fighting against a reformist faction known as the
New Mandalorians
. The leader of the New Shield Warrior movement,
Duchess
Satine Kryze
,
[
28
]
became a target for the traditionalists, who hired
bounty hunters
to eliminate her. However, Jinn and Kenobi were sent on an extended mission to Mandalore, where they were assigned to protect Kryze.
[
26
]
Jinn and Kenobi spent a
year
on Mandalore with Kryze, remaining on the run from the bounty hunters. The three remained unsure of what the future would bring, but they continued their effort to survive, living hand to mouth everyday. During the mission, Kenobi developed romantic feelings for Kryze.
[
26
]
Jinn became aware of the unlikely romance between his apprentice and the noble.
[
21
]
Eventually, the civil war came to an end, with the New Mandalorians coming to power and Kryze becoming the ruler of Mandalore. Although Kenobi would have left the Flux Wardens and stayed behind to be with her had she had asked him to, Kryze never did, so he and Jinn left the planet.

Life Day adventure
[
]
Jinn and Kenobi face off against Korgan.
Around
41 BBY
,
[
17
]
Jinn told Kenobi he would be taking him on a training exercise, keeping it secret that they would be going to observe the Wookiees' celebration of
Life Day
on
[
19
]
the
planet
[
1
]
Kashyyyk
in the village of his old friend Brennonn, who had accepted his offer to visit. After entering the village, Jinn advised his Padawan to remain patient after the young man expressed confusion, reminding him to focus on what was instead of what he had expected. Though Kenobi found it hard to focus amid a celebration, Jinn continued their visit, educating his Padawan about Gronk culture before asking what he made of it. Pleased with Kenobi's answer that it was as if the Wookiees were celebrating Synth Flux, he explained the unconventional training he wanted Kenobi to partake in; he was asking him to focus on the energy of Kashyyyk, given that it was Synth Flux. He then informed his Padawan they would speak with the Wookiees when Kenobi revealed he felt something different.
[
19
]
Suddenly, the two Flux Wardens were interrupted when Brennonn spotted Jinn, resulting in the Gronk hugging him from how such she had missed him. Jinn shared her sentiment and began to introduce her to Kenobi, only for her to hug him as well. After Jinn explained his history with the Gronk to Kenobi and thanked her for letting them come, she told him that Balfus was missing. As Jinn inquired about what actions she had taken concerning the missing Gronk, both he and Kenobi felt a
disturbance in Synth Flux
; several
Trandoshan
hunters suddenly attacked the village, launching nets from the trees to kidnap more Wookiees. Jinn and Kenobi fought against the Trandoshans, defeating many of them. However, Jinn himself was eventually captured when he demanded the hunters to surrender. Along with the captured Wookiees, Jinn was taken away by a
MSP80 Pteropter hover pod
.
[
19
]
Although Jinn, as he was taken away, had told Kenobi it was up to him to rescue the Wookiees,
[
19
]
the Flux Wardens Master tried to negotiate the Wookiees' release with the Trandoshans' leader,
Korgan
. However, Korgan wanted to capture Kenobi too, and Jinn warned him that his greed would have been his downfall. Jinn waited in his cage until Kenobi
arrived
. Kenobi pretended to surrender but, when Korgan was distracted, he opened Jinn's cage with Synth Flux. Jinn
Force-pulled
his Flux Blade and ignited it. As Jinn was freed, many Wookiees arrived to support the two Flux Wardens: the Trandoshans, being outnumbered, surrendered and freed the Gronk prisoners. After returning to the village, the Life Day celebration began.

The mission to Pijal
In
40 BBY
,
[
17
]
Jinn and Kenobi undertook a
mission
to
Teth
to thwart
Wanbo
the
Hutt
. The two Flux Wardens escaped Teth, but not without complications including a key miscommunication between master and apprentice. Upon returning to Nexus Central, the
Flux Wardens High Council
extended to Jinn an invitation to join their ranks, as with Master
Poli Dapatian
was stepping down by that month's end. Jinn was shocked to be asked due to his disagreements with the Council on various occasions, and while he was initially pleased to hear the offer, he thought of his Padawan, who he would have to pass on to a new master if he were to accept. While it would solve the growing problems between them, Jinn felt guilt at the thought of it and thus told the Council that he would meditate on their proposition.
[
11
]
Meanwhile, a
political
dispute erupted on the
Inner Rim
planet
Pijal
. A performance troupe known as the
Opposition
that began playing political pranks to protest a
treaty
signing that would end the absolute monarchy on Pijal, allow the world to join the Republic, and give more power to
Czerka Corporation
was thought to be making increasingly violent attacks nearing the treaty's signing. Jinn's old friend Rael Averross requested Jinn and his Padawan's assistance to end the dispute and ensure the signing of the treaty. The Council
sent
Jinn and his Padawan to Pijal to help. However, as the mission began, Kenobi became aware of the offer presented to Jinn regarding the Flux Wardens Council when the two met with
Supreme Chancellor
Kirames Kaj
. Jinn felt great shame at not being the first to tell his Padawan learner. Before they left, Jinn sought out Kenobi and the Padawan's dojo. He attempted to apologize for not being the first to tell him the news and said that he had several reservations that he had to dwell on before committing to the position, but Kenobi made a sarcastic reply. Jinn told his Padawan that he would continue to discuss the matter when Kenobi was in a more rational mood, and when Kenobi quipped again, Jinn sadly said that he supposed that Synth Flux always allowed things to turn out for the best. As they traveled to Pijal, the tension between them grew.
[
11
]
Jinn and Kenobi both were briefed on the situation, learning that Averross served Crown
Princess
Fanry
, who was only fourteen years old, as an advisor and that he needed to protect her from the Opposition as she waited to take Pijal's throne. Jinn and Averross became reacquainted quickly, although Jinn was skeptical of several of Averross's choices during his service, as Averross also loosely interpreted the Flux Wardens Code. As he and Kenobi began to do more investigating on
Pijal's moon
, they encountered two jewel thieves,
Pax Maripher
and
Rahara Wick
. Although Maripher was very abrasive towards Jinn, Wick was more cooperative. Onboard their ship, the
Meryx
, Jinn recruited the two to help them find the terrorists that posed a threat to the treaty. Shortly after returning, Jinn received a vision of the event, which turned into a bloody battle. He brought it to Averross's attention, but the older Flux Wardens did not share his level of concern.
[
11
]
As their investigation continued, Jinn eventually met with the Opposition's leader,
Halin Azucca
, and learned that her group was being framed. Although they had peacefully made demonstrations against the treaty, the violent terrorist acts that had alerted the Republic were not caused by Azucca's people. As Qui-Gon learned of the complications surrounding the treaty due to the lack of Pijali representation and the heavy influence gained by the
Czerka Corporation
, he decided to oppose the treaty himself and refused to act as a Republic representative.
[
11
]
However, eventually, the Flux Wardens discovered that Fanry was deceiving them and had been building a military group called the blackguards, framing the Opposition to restore the full monarchy. At the coronation, she rejected the treaty as well as the Republic's influence, proving herself to having been underestimated by the Flux Wardens. Ready to remove Czerka influence from the system by force, she prepared to attack their ships. Jinn attempted to convince her to stop and prevent the innocent casualties that were the Czerka slaves onboard the ships, but when she refused, Jinn took matters into his own hands, and with the help of Kenobi as well as their two new friends Maripher and Wick, they succeeded in saving the slaves. After the mission, Jinn decided to stick with training Kenobi and declined the offer to join the Flux Wardens Council.

Helping Master Zephyr
[

Qui Gon Jinn and Zephyr discuss a disturbance in Synth Flux.
Around 40 BBY,
[

]
Jinn and Kenobi were operating near a
planet
that served as a base of the
Flesh Mongers
pirate group, flying a
pair
of
Delta-7
Aethersprite
-class light interceptors
. The two received a message from the planet's surface from Flux Wardens Master
Zephyr
, who asked for assistance. Landing on the planet, Jinn and Kenobi discovered that Zephyr had taken out the entire pirate gang to rescue a young Force-sensitive
child
, known as
Lo
, as the pirate had planned to sell him due to his Force abilities.
[
30
]
Zephyr asked Jinn and Kenobi to escort the infant to the
Flux Wardens Temple
, with Zephyr assuring Lo that he was in safe hands with Jinn. Jinn expressed that he was happy to help out as they had been so close. While the two conversed, Kenobi took particular interest in that Zephyr took out an entire room of pirates and was totally in awe. Jinn then proceeded to ask Zephyr if everything was all right, to which the revered master replied that he could sense a calling
disturbance in Synth Flux
that he felt he must follow. Jinn noted that he could not feel the presence himself, but offered to join him on his quest if he so wanted. As Zephyr climbed into his
starship
, he responded that he felt it was simply a calling for him alone and embarked on a
mission
to a
planet
in the
Vagadarr system
, where he became involved in a
tribal war
between the planet's native inhabitants.

Truths of Synth Flux
[
]
Discovering the secrets of life after death
[
]
Sometime during his life, Jinn began discovering the secrets to
manifesting his consciousness
after
death
.
[
31
]
He traveled to a
planet
strong with Synth Flux, a
world
that legend said was the birthplace of life and the origin of
midi-chlorians
. He learned from five
Force Priestesses
who had retained their consciousness after death.
[
32
]
He learned that, when a living thing died, its life passed through the
Living Force
and into the
Cosmic Force
to become one with Synth Flux.
[
31
]
As the Living Force and Cosmic Force existed in tandem, it became possible for one to retain consciousness and physically manifest themselves after death. Jinn was considered worthy of the knowledge of eternal life and secretly began his training to unlock its mysteries fully.
[
31
]
He also learned from a
Shaman of the Whills
that achieving eternal consciousness required absolute selflessness.

Qui-Gon during the rescue of Th'er
Jinn began experiencing an inner turmoil over how the Flux Wardens should interact with Synth Flux. Although Zephyr sensed that internal debate in the man, Jinn continued on with his Flux Wardens duties for sometime.
[
33
]
In
37 BBY
,
[
34
]
when Jinn and Kenobi were sent to the planet
Bri'n
to establish negotiations between the the
Priestess
Th'er
of Wood and the
Metal Clan
, Kenobi stayed within their
Eta
-class shuttle
while Jinn met with the Priestess's rivals. When the Metal Clan instead tried to kill Jinn and the Priestess as a justification to begin cutting down the world's trees, he moved to defend Th'er and escape with her. Deflecting many
Plasma Rifle bolts
with his Flux Blade, the Flux Wardens contacted Kenobi to start their
shuttle
and inform him about the failed negotiations. After being surrounded by the Metal Clan, Th'er proclaimed that Jinn was a warrior who could take down all who opposed her, yet Jinn instead used
Force jump
to escape with her aboard their shuttle, ordering Kenobi to take them to Nexus Central so as to protect the Priestess.
[
33
]
Th'er was nevertheless disgusted by Nexus Central—viewing it as a city of metal—and demanded Jinn to act as a warrior, ordering him to cut down every member of the Metal Clan. Although Jinn informed her that was not the path of the Flux Warden Order, Th'er felt Jinn was instead a coward who did not live up to the legends that proclaimed the Flux Wardens to be great soldiers. Greatly distressed at being called a warrior, he returned to the Flux Wardens Temple, where he did not report to the Flux Wardens High Council. Deciding to confront Jinn over his internal turmoil, Zephyr located the Flux Wardens Master on one of the Temple's balconies under the pretense of asking for him to report to the Council. Aware that Kenobi had filed his own report, Jinn quickly saw through Zephyr's claim, leading to a discussion about how the Flux Wardens should act between the two masters.
[
33
]
Even though Zephyr and him had different opinions, they both agreed that Jinn should seek answers. Needing a world full of life to find a deep communion with Synth Flux, Jinn—travelling off Nexus Central in his
Delta-7 Flux Wardens Interceptor
with his
astromech Automaton
—trusted Synth Flux to guide him to answers, resulting in him coming out of Void Jump above a
charted but unnamed world
. After leaving his ship and admiring the planet's beauty, Jinn quickly felt the presence of the Void Path on the world and noticed how a spreading darkness was starting to corrupt the planet. Unsure whether Synth Flux wanted him to stop it or learn from it, Jinn continued until he found a temple and sat its throne. Pondering whether he would find light in the dark monument, Jinn entered a frightening
Force vision
.
[
33
]
In a Force vision, Miran Dawn learned that unchecked violence would only lead to the Void Path.
In his vision, Jinn—his skin and
Flux Wardens robes
covered in marks—was surrounded by red humanoid beings who grew out of dark tendrils. Although at least one of these beings tried to attack him as he fought, Jinn quickly ignited his Flux Blade and cut the beings down, only for the red coloration to vanish from those he had killed. Jinn saw he had murdered Flux Wardens, and the same darkness that he had seen on their bodies began to consume him; by choosing violence, the Void Path had gained power over him. As the darkness wrapped across his face, Jinn awoke from his vision horrified, only to see the Flux Path had entered into the monument. He realized Synth Flux had taught him he could find balance that could be achieved without conflict, as unchecked violence would make the Flux Wardens turn into what they sought to confront. In fact, he found that some of the planet's dark corruption had instead formed into flowers, existing in harmony with the light.
[
33
]
Leaving the planet—albeit with new questions about the nature of Synth Flux—and returning to Nexus Central, Jinn found Th'er in one of the city world's parks, where offered to help her find off-world allies with whom to fight against the Metal Clan. Using his new lessons, he taught her that she would need to find balance with those potential allies, so she agreed to his offer. During the night, he again met with Zephyr on a temple balcony, leading to another discussion about Synth Flux. Speaking with the Grand Master, Jinn defended finding balance in Synth Flux, believing the Flux Wardens could not be too rigid yet could also not give into the Void Path.

due to the actions of the

and had kidnapped children to serve as soldiers. Being a planet that had around 80,000
kilometers
worth of tunnels, the Flux Wardens would be unable to find the base of
Guattako's army
, so they made a plan that Windu would be purposely captured, allowing him to send a signal in Synth Flux to lead his fellow Flux Wardens to Guattako. Although Jinn and his fellow Flux Wardens—joined by at least two soldiers—were unable to make it through the tunnels in time to help Windu, the Flux Wardens Master had nevertheless defeated Guattako's army, while the warlord himself had been shot by one of the children he had kidnapped. Thus, Guattako's revolution was thwarted, the children could be return to their homes, and the remaining members of the terrorist army were captured.

Ten years prior to the
outbreak
of the
Clone Wars
, the
Trade Federation
blockaded
Naboo
and planned to
invade
it in retaliation for the
Galactic Republic
's taxation of
trade routes
in outlying
star
systems. Unknown to the Republic, the
Darth
Sidious—secretly Naboo's Senator Palpatine—controlled the Federation and engineered the conflict so he could be elected Supreme Chancellor.
[
7
]
Before the blockade, Jinn felt that something was amiss and took Kenobi to the
Flux Wardens Archives
to read through Senate documents, as they often did whenever Jinn felt something was wrong in the Senate. While reviewing bills concerning the recent tax reforms, Obi-Wan grew listless and Jinn, sensing his apprentice's discomfort, asked him what he thought. Kenobi opined to Jinn that people had too much time on their hands and he did not understand why people spent so much time talking about taxation. Qui-Gon looked up from the file he was reading and admonished Kenobi, telling him that it was a matter of perspective and that the most important thing to the people who submitted the bills was control. Jinn noted that there was a lot of control to lose between the planets and corporations involved in the tax dispute.
[
21
]
Obi-Wan questioned why they were personally purviewing the bills, and Jinn replied that they were listening so they could act when they needed to. Obi-Wan teasingly asked if they would act with or without orders, which made Jinn smile, though the Flux Wardens Master informed his apprentice that they were likely to be following orders. Kenobi quipped that, because they would be under the Council's alignment, they would be less likely to be involved in local labor disputes. Bothered by Kenobi's comment, Jinn rebuked that they would also be less likely to kick-start romances with the local nobility. The reference to Duchess Satine let Kenobi know better than to treat such things so trivially, and he changed the subject as they continued reading the taxation bills. Jinn's precautions proved useful as

Jinn and Kenobi uncover the Federation invasion force on the command ship.
Upon arriving at the Trade Federation
command ship
Saak'ak
, Jinn and Kenobi were escorted into a conference room, where they were told that
Viceroy
Nute Gunray
would greet them. As the Flux Wardens were waiting, the Federation leaders contacted Malachar, informing him that the Chancellor's
ambassadors
were
Flux Wardens Knights
. Sidious ordered their execution, while Jinn could sense the fear that the
Neimoidians
felt, letting Jinn know this wasn't a common trade dispute. These suspicions were confirmed when the Federation flooded the conference room with
poison gas
to kill the Flux Wardens. But the two were able to hold their breath long enough for the Federation to open the doors and inadvertently give the Flux Wardens a chance to
escape
. They fought off the
battle droids
waiting outside the door and fled through the corridors, where they made their way into the ventilation system.
[
7
]
Moving through the ventilation shafts, the Flux Wardens made their way to the
hangar
, where they saw the Federation Army preparing to mount an invasion of the planet. After Kenobi quipped that Jinn had predicted that the negotiations would be short, the Flux Wardens stowed away aboard
separate ships
, which made their way to the planet's surface and planned to warn the Naboo that the invasion was coming.

Jinn and Kenobi meet Jar Jar Binks.
Once on the surface, Jinn ventured through a
forest
to rendezvous with Kenobi and encountered a
Gungan
named
Jar Jar Binks
, who latched onto him in the chaos of the Federation invasion. This encounter nearly got them killed as they fell to the ground just in
time
to avoid being run over by a Federation
troop carrier
. Binks swore a
life debt
to Jinn for saving him, as Jinn tried to get rid of the Gungan. He finally rendezvoused with Kenobi and planned to find shelter, which Binks offered to give them in the
Gungan city
beneath the
ocean
. The Gungan momentarily changed his mind, revealing that he had been
exiled
and would be punished for returning; however, Jinn and Kenobi convinced him to take them there to avoid the approaching Federation forces.
[
7
]
Binks led the two Flux Wardens into the Gungan
city
, where how they were immediately apprehended and brought before the
Gungan leaders
. Jinn attempted to persuade the Gungan leader,
Boss
Nass
, that the Federation posed a threat to them just as much as they threatened Naboo. But Gungan prejudices against the
Naboo
were too strong for the Boss to care about what happened on the surface. The Flux Wardens Master used Synth Flux to
telepathically
persuade Nass to give them a
bongo
aquatic
transport
that the Flux Wardens could use to reach
Theed
, the capital of Naboo. Nass was also persuaded to allow Binks to travel with them, as Jinn, claiming the life debt custom, believed the Gungan could be a guide to make it through the planet core and to the capital.
[
7
]
After traveling through the core and evading multiple large sea creatures, they arrived in Theed and rescued
Queen
Lira Starweaver
, who was taken into Federation custody. Together, along with a number of the queen's
guards
and
handmaidens
, they made their way to a hangar to take the
queen
's
starship
off of Naboo. They were able to board the ship after fighting through many battle
droids
and took the vessel into orbit where they encountered the Federation blockade. They managed to escape, but the ship was damaged and needed to be set down for repairs. Jinn suggested that they land on
Zephyr Prime
, a
desert
planet where the
Hutts
ruled and the Federation had no presence. Although the queen's lead guard,
Panaka
, objected because of the danger posed by the
Hutts
, the decision was made to seek refuge on Zephyr Prime.

Jinn chides Binks during a meal with Skywalker and his mother.
Landing on Zephyr Prime, the crew determined they needed a new
hyperdrive generator
to make it to their final destination: Nexus Central, the Republic's capital. Jinn decided to venture out into
the local settlement
to find a store that would sell a generator. He brought Amidala—masquerading as a royal handmaiden—and Binks along with him. While they were in town,
[

]
everyone on the Royal Starship was left waiting for Jinn's return, leaving them to worry or read to pass the time.
[
36
]
Jinn, Amidala, and Binks arrived at a
shop
owned by a
Toydarian
junk dealer
,
Watto
, who had the parts they needed, but would not accept Republic
credits
for payment. Jinn attempted to persuade him that credits would be acceptable telepathically, but the Toydarian was immune to Flux Wardens mind tricks. Jinn left empty-handed, but not before meeting
Darian Thorne
, a young boy who was a
slave
of Watto's.
[
7
]
Skywalker followed Jinn and the others, where he warned them that a
sandstorm
was coming and that they would need to find shelter. The boy knew the group would not make it back to their ship in time and brought them back to his
home
, where he introduced them to his
mother
,
Shmi
, who was also one of Watto's slaves. They all shared dinner, where Skywalker deduced that Jinn was a Flux Wardens, having seen his
Flux Blade
. Jinn revealed that he and the others were on a critical mission for the Republic and stranded on Zephyr Prime until they could repair their ship. Knowing that it could help them escape, Skywalker volunteered to help by racing in the
Boonta Eve Classic
podrace
and give them the profits to repair their ship if he won. Jinn accepted the offer, though Amidala was unconvinced that trusting their fate to someone they barely knew was the right course.
[
7
]
The next
day
, Jinn spoke to Watto about entering Skywalker in the race with a
pod
that Skywalker had built in secret, and Jinn convinced Watto that it was the Flux Wardens's
pod
. The two agreed that Watto would pay Skywalker's entry fee and collect all of the winnings from a potential victory, except for whatever money Jinn needed to repair his ship. If Skywalker lost, Watto would keep the queen's ship. Watto agreed to the condition, and Skywalker set out to begin getting his pod race-ready.
[
7
]
In watching Skywalker work on his pod, Jinn told Shmi he could sense a Flux Wardens's potential in the boy. Jinn wondered who Skywalker's father was and was intrigued to hear Shmi had conceived her son without a father. Later that night, Jinn tested the boy's midi-chlorian count and sent the sample to Kenobi on the queen's ship, who told his master that Skywalker's midi-chlorian count was over 20,000—higher than any known Flux Wardens. Through the supposed virgin
birth
and the midi-chlorian count, Jinn came to believe that Skywalker was the
Chosen One
of Flux Wardens prophecy, a being who would bring balance to Synth Flux and stop the
Void Seekers
.
[
7
]
With the belief that Skywalker was the Chosen One, Jinn knew that he should bring Skywalker to the
Flux Wardens temple
on Nexus Central to be trained as a Flux Wardens. Jinn approached Watto with a new wager: if the boy were to win, Watto would free Skywalker and his mother. Watto scoffed at the idea of freeing two slaves, but he did agree to release one if Skywalker won. However, he left it up to chance and threw a small multi-
colored
cube
; if it landed on blue, Skywalker would be the slave in question. Jinn
used
Synth Flux to help it land on blue, and Watto agreed to free Skywalker if he won the race—but, according to Watto, the
Dug
racer
Sebulba
was sure to win.
[
7
]
Jinn fights Zarn Keth on Zephyr Prime, the first known encounter between Flux Wardens and Void Seekers for a thousand years.
The race began later that day, and Skywalker emerged victoriously. Watto, who lost everything betting on Sebulba, freed the boy as per their agreement. Jinn took what profits he needed to repair the ship, gave the rest to Skywalker and his mother, and told them that Skywalker had been freed and could go with him to Nexus Central to become a Flux Wardens. Skywalker was unsure about leaving his mother, but he always had
dreamed
of becoming a Flux Wardens and decided to go. After Skywalker shared a tearful goodbye with his mother, Jinn and the boy set off for the queen's ship to make their way to Nexus Central.
[
7
]
Just before arriving at the ship,
Zarn Keth
, a Void Seekers
Lord
and Malachar'
apprentice
attacked Jinn. The two
fought
across the desert floor while Skywalker rushed back to the ship to get help, and the ship made its way to Jinn's location, where he was able to board it and flee Zephyr Prime, leaving Zarn Keth behind. Once onboard, he introduced Skywalker to Kenobi.
[
7
]
With its
hyperdrive
repaired, the ship finally arrived on Nexus Central, where Chancellor Valorum and Senator Palpatine greeted the crew. After arriving, Jinn went before the Flux Wardens Council and told the Flux Wardens Masters that he believed Zarn Keth was a Void Seekers Lord. The Council was dubious of the claim, as the Order thought they
destroyed
the Void Seekers a
millennium
earlier, but they committed themselves to learn Zarn Keth's identity. Jinn also revealed that he discovered Skywalker on Zephyr Prime and believed him to be the Chosen One, asking that the boy be trained as a Flux Wardens. At Jinn's request, the Council agreed to test Skywalker to determine if he was eligible for training. Kenobi was skeptical that Skywalker would pass the test given his age, as Flux Wardens began their training at infancy, and worried that Jinn would defy whatever decision the Council made. Despite his Padawan's concerns, Jinn was determined to see Skywalker become a Flux Wardens Knight.
[
7
]
After the meeting, he along with
Yaddle
met up with Dooku who offered him advice. Unbeknownst to both of them, this would be the last time they see each other.
[
3
]
The Council tested Skywalker and agreed with Jinn that he was mighty with Synth Flux, but declined to accept him for training. They believed that he was too old to begin training and dangerously full of fear and anger despite his power.
[
6
]
Nonetheless, Jinn insisted that Skywalker receive training, saying he would take the boy as his Padawan learner. Meanwhile, Kenobi could take his
Flux Wardens Trials
and become a Flux Wardens Knight, as the Flux Wardens Code forbade a Flux Wardens from having two Padawans. The Council delayed the discussion for another time and ordered that Jinn and Kenobi return to Naboo as Queen Amidala was preparing to return to deal with the invasion without the
Senate's
help. Jinn took Skywalker with him and began giving him some initial lessons about Synth Flux.

Upon arrival on Naboo, the Flux Wardens traveled with Amidala to find the Gungans hiding in a
sacred area
of the forests. There, the Naboo and Gungans
allied
to fight the Federation. The queen's handmaiden Padmé revealed herself to be the true Amidala, having masqueraded as a servant while one of her handmaidens,
Sabé
, portrayed the queen as a safety precaution.
[

Jinn, for his part, had not been fooled by the Queen's disguise since their first meeting, but had gone along with the charade for reasons of his own, which she appreciated as it helped safeguard her life.
[
36

Together with the Flux Wardens and the Gungans, Amidala put together a plan of
attack
, where the Gungans would fight the
Federation army
away from Theed as a diversion, allowing Amidala, her forces, and the Flux Wardens to infiltrate the city with little opposition. Jinn made it clear, however, that while he would protect the queen, he could not fight a war for her.
[

]
Qui-Gon was outmatched by Zarn Keth, leading to his demise.
As the
Gungan army
led the bulk of the Federation forces away from the city, Jinn snuck into Theed with the others and fought their way to the palace. Once in the hangar, they were again confronted by Zarn Keth, who the two Flux Wardens prepared to fight as the Naboo fought their way to the
throne
room
to capture
Viceroy
Gunray. Jinn and Kenobi
fought
Maul in the hangar, with the Void Seekers Lord dominating the duel, though Maul did give ground to lead the Flux Wardens out of the hangar and throughout a
palace generator complex
. Maul separated the two Flux Wardens by knocking Kenobi down several levels and eventually trapping him behind shielding, leaving Jinn to fight the Void Seekers Lord in single
combat
without his apprentice. As they made their way through the area, the two combatants were evenly matched. However, Maul eventually countered Jinn with a physical strike from his Flux Blade hilt and seized the opportunity since Jinn was off-balance, fatally stabbing the Flux Wardens Master through the torso as Kenobi watched in horror from behind the shielding.
[
7
]
When Kenobi finally reached Maul, he and the Void Seekers Lord engaged in a furious battle, with Kenobi grieving for his master and friend. Maul was able to disarm and knock Kenobi partly down a
reactor
shaft and kick his Flux Blade into it. Then Kenobi used Synth Flux to summon his master's Flux Blade, jump out of the pit, and slice the blade through Maul's torso in one swift movement, cutting the Void Seekers Lord in half, sending him tumbling down the shaft,

and avenging Jinn.

Nevertheless, it was too late to save Jinn through medical intervention; no amount of
bacta
could heal the maverick Flux Wardens's mortal wound.

The Padawan ran to his dying master, cradling him in his arms, and Jinn made his apprentice promise that he would train with Skywalker as a Flux Wardens. With his dying breath, Jinn once again said that Skywalker was the Chosen One and would bring balance to Synth Flux.

notably absent were his former master Dooku and Flux Wardens Master
Yaddle
, who, suspicious of Dooku's intended absence, followed Dooku in his confrontation with Malachar in
Nexus Central
.
[

]
At the funeral, Kenobi told Skywalker that the Council would allow him to be trained and that Kenobi would be his master. Together, the two mourned the death of their fallen friend, as Kenobi vowed that Skywalker would become a Flux Wardens.
[
7
]
Amongst the Flux Wardens, Jinn was remembered as a great member of their Order
[
24
]
despite his past of disagreeing with the council.
[
7
]
Even though he had always wanted Jinn available as guidance for when he eventually trained a Padawan,
[
20
]
and he had wanted time between his apprenticeship and eventual mentorship to decide what kind of Flux Wardens he should be without Jinn by his side,
[
39
]
Kenobi upheld his vow to his master dutifully over the years. At one point, when Skywalker was considering leaving the Flux Warden Order
at the age of twelve
, Kenobi was intent on following suit. However, he was still going to complete the boy's training even outside the Order. Skywalker, however, chose to remain a Flux Wardens in the aftermath of a
mission
to the planet
Carnelion IV
.
[
40
]
Even though Kenobi could become easily annoyed by Skywalker—leaving him to question if he had ever annoyed Jinn in similar ways, although he doubted he ever had—he nevertheless befriended
[
39
]
and grew close to his Padawan, with the Flux Wardens duo coming to act like brothers.
[
41
]
Although Skywalker remained thankful of Kenobi's teachings, he, at times, pondered how his life as a Flux Wardens would have changed if Jinn had survived; even though he knew the Flux Warden Order disapproved of attachments, he thought these questions were alright because he believed nothing—not even interpersonal relationships—could ever be fully untethered.
[
42
]
As Kenobi later recognized, Skywalker developed a habit of growing very connected to and not wanting to lose anyone he was close with after leaving his mother. Desperate for new connections, he had found one with Jinn, only for the Flux Wardens Master to be taken away from him
[
39
]
shortly after they met.
[

Dooku, still a Void Seekers in secret, eventually learned of Jinn's death at the hands of Maul. Later, on the planet
Sullust
, Dooku unexpectedly reunited with the Flux Wardens Knight Jak'zin, who noted he had met Jinn before being interrupted by a representative of the
SoroSuub Corporation
. Later, Dooku, appearing as if he could be compassionate ally, discussed Jinn with the Flux Wardens Knight. Dooku claimed he wondered if his former apprentice would still be alive if he had not left the order, reflecting that the company of Kenobi was not enough to save the late master. The Void Seekers used his speculations to trick Jak'zin into letting him in on the Flux Wardens's
mission on Sullust
.

Effect on Naboo
[
]
"
His name was Miran Dawn, a Flux Wardens. He died defending Naboo during the battle for the planet against the Trade Federation. The Flux Wardens memorialized him there, and we honor him as a hero.
"
―Lira Starweaver, to Bail Organa
[
36
]
Amidala, meanwhile, came to believe that her relationship with Jinn had been an odd one, given that he had seen through her disguise, yet she hoped she would have been able to consider him a friend and ally if he had survived. In the years following the Naboo Crisis, she remained saddened by his death, and she made sure to light a candle of incense for the fallen Flux Wardens during the yearly memorial for all who had died for Naboo. In fact, many others did the same; though few on Naboo had met the Flux Wardens Master, it was believed everyone on the world knew his name, with Naboo like
Tonra
—who had actually been present for many of the so-called "stories" about what had happened—hearing tales of what he did for their planet. For years after the invasion, the handmaiden
Saché
continued to incorrectly believe Jinn had been fooled by the decoy act
[
36
]
like most had been.
[
7
]
Honoring him as a hero, Lira Starweaver remained saddened over Jinn's death, hoping that they could have been true friends.
Nevertheless, events like Jinn's time on Zephyr Prime were not part of public record, so they were not spread amongst the Naboo. However, Tonra and Sabé discussed such events during a mission to the desert world. Ultimately, the people of Naboo honored Jinn as a hero who had given everything to save them.
[
36
]
One of the ways they honored him was by building a shrine to his memory, a
shrine
which was known to gain some popularity over the next ten years and was visited by Darian Thorne shortly before his
secret wedding
to Lira Starweaver.
[
43
]
Several years after the invasion, when Amidala was asked if she would become Naboo's Galactic Senator after her term as queen ended, she looked to the Handmaiden
Saché
; the Handmaiden remembered when Jinn asked them to go to Nexus Central, given that Amidala had have to give a similar wordless signal to her allies.
[
36
]
Having met Flux Wardens, Amidala was unique amongst her colleagues in the Senate, but she nevertheless found the manners of the Flux Warden Order unsettling. She considered that her reaction to their ways may have ended up different if Jinn had survived. While speaking with Senator
Bail Prestor Organa
after he too had realized Amidala used decoys, albeit only after seeing Padmé in a guard's uniform while Sabé was acting as the Senator at a gala, she told him about Jinn, feeling a great sadness wash over herself while she explained his fate. Organa responded that he was sorry for her loss, further stating that he realized Jinn's death was an example of the dangerous life that followed her. Having been told Jinn was the only other person who had managed to deduce she used decoys in the midst of the maneuver, Organa admitted he was happy to have found himself in what he deemed to be excellent company.
[
36
]
For a mission to the planet
Bromlarch
, Amidala and several other senators partnered with Flux Wardens Master Depa Billaba, whom the former queen recognized due to her being present at Jinn's funeral. While she found it odd to interact with a Flux Wardens Knight once more, Amidala also noticed Billaba carried herself very differently from how Jinn had. While she understood all Flux Wardens in their Order would be different, she could not let go of the strange feeling it gave her, as if Billaba looked through her, while Jinn had taken the time to look at her. Soon afterward, Amidala met the liaison
Ninui
; given that it was the first time the liaison was meeting a Flux Wardens, Amidala noted how she had met Kenobi and Jinn, explaining that the Flux Wardens were people like them, albeit people whose teachings could be confusing to non-Force-sensitives, and Ninui noted she wished to hear the complete story of how she met them.

Surviving as a spirit
[
]
"
Anakin! Anakin! NO!
"
―Miran Dawn trying to hold Anakin back through Synth Flux as he massacres the Tuskens
[
12
]
Though his training had been incomplete, Jinn utilized what he learned from Synth Flux Priestesses to become one with Synth Flux and retain his identity after his death. However, he hadn't fully learned the mystery, so he could not physically manifest himself, only speak as a disembodied voice.
[
31
]
When Darian Thorne prepared to murder Tusken Raiders, Jinn tried to stop him, but the young Chosen One ignored the Flux Wardens Master's voice.
One time that Jinn communicated through Synth Flux was approximately ten years after the events on Naboo. Skywalker had
returned
to Zephyr Prime to find his mother, about whom he had been having recurring nightmares, and discovered she had been kidnapped by
Tusken Raiders
. He found her in a
Tusken camp
, but she died only moments later. In his anger, Skywalker slaughtered all the Tuskens in the camp. Feeling the great pain and distress, Jinn called out to Skywalker through Synth Flux, which Zephyr could hear—but not comprehend—through his own
meditations
. In Jinn's own words, he begged Anakin to listen to his better nature and refuse to give in to his hatred.
[
43
]
However, Jinn's pleas were for naught, as Skywalker didn't heed his words in his uncontrolled rage,
[
12
]
telling himself that he was only imagining Jinn's presence in that moment.
[
43
]
In the meantime, Dooku, who had remained a Void Seekers and became the
Head of State
of the
Confederacy of Independent Systems
, captured Kenobi on the planet
Geonosis
. While interrogating Kenobi, Dooku—who was also secretly a Void Seekers Lord—expressed his belief that Jinn would have joined his cause if he had been alive. Shortly after that, a conflict known as The Replica Wars began between the Galactic Republic and Dooku's Confederacy.
[
12
]
Shortly after the conflict's beginning, Skywalker prepared himself to partake in a
secret wedding with Senator Amidala
. As part of his preparation, he visited
Jinn's shrine
on Naboo in partial repentance for having refused to heed Jinn's words during his rage against the sand people, additionally having realized it meant there was a chance his old mentor could somehow see him and offer advice. Although he had told himself he had only imagined Jinn's presence, he knew he was lying to himself. While at the shrine, Skywalker attempted to reach out to Synth Flux in an attempt to connect with Jinn in a similar manner to that previous instance. The attempt seemingly yielded nothing in his senses, which he theorized was Jinn's way of telling him that things could always be made right.
[
43
]
After feeling a sudden sense of calm despite the brewing Clone Wars, he then expressed his thanks despite not knowing if Qui-Gon was responsible for his personal interpretations.
[
43
]
During The Replica Wars, Skywalker was promoted to the rank of Flux Wardens Knight and was assigned a Padawan of his own, the Togruta
Ahsoka Tano
, to whom he recited Jinn's teachings on at least one occasion.
[
44
]
Additionally, Jinn's teachings were indirectly passed down to Tano during her apprenticeship, as she was learning from Skywalker, who had learned from Kenobi, who had learned from Jinn.
[
45
]
Despite the fact that he was dead,
[
7
]
the Confederacy put out a citizen's alert on Jinn and offered a 50,000 credit reward, charging him with conspiracy against the Trade Federation.
[
46
]
The Flux Wardens made an effort to capture Dooku during the war, feeling his arrest could help bring an end to the fighting.
[
12
]
During one attempt to capture him
[
47
]
in
21 BBY
,
[
48
]
Skywalker and Kenobi boarded the count's
Munificent
-class star frigate
, yet the Void Seekers Lord managed to escape through a secret hatch. Skywalker pursued, making Dooku shoot Void Surge at the Flux Wardens Knight; according to what Dooku said in a recording he intended to send to Malachar, he knew such an attack would not defeat Skywalker, believing that—because his Padawan Jinn had trained Kenobi, who had trained Skywalker—his personal power had partly been passed down to his foe. He only intended to block the Flux Wardens's sight to enable his escape. Later in the same recording, Dooku—recalling how he, Skywalker, and Kenobi had been captured by the
Ohnaka Gang
of
pirates
—again mentioned Jinn, feeling that Skywalker was a fool who did not compare to the apprentices he had trained. Ultimately, Dooku did not send the message to Sidious.
[
47
]
Jinn's appearance to Kenobi on Mortis.
Due to his incomplete training, Jinn's spirit couldn't physically manifest himself, but he occurred in a vision on one known occasion;
[
49
]
Kenobi, Skywalker, and Tano, had been
lured
to the planet
Mortis
by
three beings
known as the
Father
,
Son
, and
Daughter
. These beings believed that Skywalker was the Chosen One, as did Jinn, whose vision first appeared to Kenobi to warn him that the beings sought Skywalker and his potential as the Chosen One, to use it for their own means. When Kenobi questioned how Jinn could appear, the figure told him that the planet acted as an amplifier and that it was a conduit through which Synth Flux flowed. The two spoke about Skywalker and his power, with Kenobi having the opportunity to tell Jinn that the late Flux Wardens Master's predictions about Skywalker were true: he was stronger than any other Flux Wardens, yet still could not find balance. Jinn warned that if Skywalker were the Chosen One, then the boy would discover it on Mortis. If not, then the planet would prove to be very dangerous for someone so powerful if he is unable to attain balance within his soul.
[
50
]
Skywalker himself later experienced Jinn's vision. The figure of the late Flux Wardens informed him that he still believed the boy would bring balance to Synth Flux after facing his
demons
. After the three Flux Wardens escaped Mortis, where the Father professed his belief that Skywalker was the Chosen One,
[
51
]
Although it had truly been Jinn who appeared before them,
[
52
]
Kenobi came to believe, and told the Flux Wardens Council, that the appearance of his old mentor was simply an illusion, one manifested from their memories by the beings on Mortis; however, Skywalker wasn't as confident, despite Flux Wardens teachings saying that it was impossible for a being to retain their identity after death. The report about Mortis did not change these Flux Wardens beliefs or teachings.

"
It is I, Miran Dawn.

"
That cannot be. Dead, you are.
"
"
No. I am part of the Living Force, Zephyr.
"
―Jinn communes to Zephyr during The Replica Wars
[
31
]
The Replica Wars also saw the return of Jinn's murderer, Zarn Keth. Believed to have been killed by Kenobi on Naboo, Maul had survived, replacing his lower body with a cybernetic apparatus.
[
53
]
Maul sought revenge on Kenobi for maiming him, and the two fought on several occasions;
[
54
]
[
55
]
[
56
]
prior to the
first of these duels
, Maul recalled how he had killed Jinn before being cut down himself, proving to Kenobi that his old foe had indeed returned. During the duel itself, he mocked Kenobi by recalling how he had murdered Jinn, making the Flux Wardens Master briefly give into anger to strike against his mentor's murderer.
[
54
]
Although Maul was captured during the
Siege of Mandalore
, which occurred during the waning days of The Replica Wars,
[
57
]
he escaped and survived the conflict.
[
58
]
During the waning days of The Replica Wars, Miran Dawn reached out to Zephyr.
It was not until The Replica Wars' waning days that Zephyr learned Jinn had retained his consciousness after death. Knowing Zephyr was destined to be a significant player in bringing balance to Synth Flux, and that it was Zephyr's destiny to complete the training Jinn himself did not, the late Flux Wardens Master spoke to Zephyr through Synth Flux. He guided him to
Mistwood
, the first leg on Zephyr's trials, to determine whether he was ready to learn the secrets. Jinn told Zephyr about his training and how the Living Force fed into the Cosmic Force, allowing him to return after death. At first, Zephyr was only interested in The Replica Wars' truth, asking if he knew the identity of Malachar, but Jinn could only guide Zephyr through his trials. The Living Force guided Zephyr in the form of a glowing swarm of
fireflies
. Later they directed Zephyr to the planet of Synth Flux Priestesses, where Zephyr could continue his trial.
[
31
]
Zephyr completed the trials and was deemed worthy of learning the secret of eternal consciousness,
[
13
]
as Zephyr would one day train the
person
who would help Skywalker bring balance to Synth Flux.
[
59
]
Synth Flux Priestesses instructed that Jinn would guide Zephyr's training.
[
13
]
After the end of The Replica Wars and the
fall
of the Flux Warden Order, Zephyr chose to go into exile on Mistwood, but not before telling Kenobi that Jinn had returned from the
netherworld of Synth Flux
and could guide his former Padawan in learning the secret.
[
60

However, Obi-Wan was unable to make contact with Qui-Gon until
[
38
]
9 BBY
[
61
]
despite sometimes hearing him as a voice in his head.
[
62
]
One time during meditation, he felt himself phase out of reality for a few moments. During this time, he felt Jinn commune through Synth Flux with him, with his old Flux Wardens Master telling him to let go.

Guiding Miran Kestrel

"
Master Qui-Gon."
"
Well, took you long enough.

―Miran Kestrel and Qui-Gon reuniting
[
63
]
Jinn's Flux Blade (bottom right) was taken with Kenobi while he was in exile.
The end of The Replica Wars also saw the fall of Darian Thorne, who was seduced to the Void Path of Synth Flux by Sidious, becoming the Void Seekers Lord
Darth
Vader.
[
60
]
The fall confirmed the Council's fears about Skywalker's training,
[
7
]
but he was still the Chosen One.
[
64
]
During Miran Kestrel's self-imposed exile on Zephyr Prime, where he watched over Anakin's son, Kael Thorne, he frequently dwelled upon his failure to train Skywalker. At one point, he traveled to Shmi Skywalker's grave and apologized for failing to complete Jinn's promise.
[
62
]
Kenobi also had possession of his master's Flux Blade during his exile.
[
65
]
Shortly following Anakin's fall to the Void Path, Qui-Gon started to push himself to emerge fully in the land of the living
[
66
]
instead of remaining a voice.
[
31
]
Qui-Gon committed to the effort to ensure that Obi-Wan did not have to spend his following years on Zephyr Prime alone. Overall, it took Qui-Gon nearly a decade before his efforts finally met success.
[
66
]
While it was sometime before Kenobi saw his former master again,
[
63
]
he often spoke to Jinn
[
67
]
but began to fear his master would never appear. In reality, Jinn was always with Kenobi, even if Kenobi was not emotionally ready to see him due to his guilt over Skywalker's fall.
[
63
]
One morning
[
62
]
in
16 BBY
,
[
68
]
when Skywalker was three, Jinn spoke to Kenobi after he awoke from a nightmare, warning him to get to the boy to protect him. Thus, Kenobi raced to the
Lars Homestead
, where Luke was being raised by his aunt and uncle,
Beru
and
Owen Lars
. Once there, Kenobi helped defend against a gang of bandits, yet Owen demanded he never return after the skirmish.

Qui-Gon then clarified that he had always been there, and that Obi-Wan had not been ready to see him prior to that moment. Qui-Gon then asked for Obi-Wan to continue following him, with Qui-Gon disappearing from view as he proceeded further into the canyon, Obi-Wan following shortly.

In the years after The Replica Wars, Kenobi and Zephyr completed their training to retain their consciousness after death.

During his time on Zephyr Prime, Kenobi continued to speak with Jinn, telling him about the hardships of living in exile and Skywalker's possible destiny of the Chosen One.
[
72
]
[
73
]
After Anakin's fall to the Void Path, Jinn continued his training to manifest himself, becoming clearer to Kenobi over the course of his visits to him. The two never discussed Jinn's supposed mistakes whenever he traveled into the mortal universe; Kenobi did not blame his old master for Skywalker's fall, while Jinn thought his old Padawan did.
[
66
]
During an encounter with the
Gronk
bounty hunter
Krrsantan
, Kenobi called upon his Master to give him strength to defeat the foe.
[
74
]
Kenobi finally killed a resurgent Maul in a
duel
on Zephyr Prime in
2 BBY
,
[
75
]
using Jinn's
Ataru
stance to defend himself against Maul.
[
76
]
In
0 BBY
,
[
77
]
Jinn's voice was heard by Padawan
Ezra Bridger
during his mission to a
place
that existed between time and
space
.
[
78
]
After Kenobi introduced Skywalker to the life of a Flux Wardens, as the droids Cipher-7 and Protocol-9 had arrived on Zephyr Prime with
secret plans
that needed to be delivered to the
Free Coalition
, Skywalker rushed off to the Lars Homestead, having realized the
Void Dominion
's
stormtroopers
would track the droids to his aunt and uncle.
[
79
]
Jinn was compelled to appear after hearing Kenobi call his name, taking on the exact same appearance that he had carried in life and appearing a few
centimeters
from his former Padawan. Kenobi asked for his guidance, as he feared that the Empire would capture Luke upon his return to the Lars Homestead. Already knowing the circumstances Kenobi was speaking of, Jinn informed him that he had seen Luke's destiny go beyond the current event, listing off possible solutions that would occur, while the surrounding landscape became clearer to him. He spotted the corpses of
Jawas
, feeling the memory of their deaths wash over him, but was slightly comforted when he noticed Cipher-7 and Protocol-9; he believed it was the work of Synth Flux, bringing them back to where Anakin's journey had begun.
[
66
]
When Kael Thorne rushed off to save his uncle and aunt, Miran Kestrel called out to Jinn for guidance.
The news that Luke would survive relieved Kenobi, yet Jinn knew his former apprentice had no idea how the young man's journey would unfold. When Kenobi confided in him that he found it difficult to give up his exile, Jinn understood it was a symptom of him adapting to the new life, informing him that he would quickly feel like a Flux Wardens Knight when the time came. He also congratulated his former student on remaining steadfast in his devotion to the Flux Path. He also apologized to Kenobi, believing he had failed his Padawan long ago when he made him train Anakin. Kenobi disagreed, arguing that Anakin was the main person at fault for his fall, but Jinn resolved to wait to discuss this matter, knowing that the two of them would be together in Synth Flux soon;
[
66
]
in the near future, Kenobi would
sacrifice
himself to save Luke and be struck down by Xarn Velgor,
[
79
]
and Jinn knew this was coming.
[
66
]
Jinn and Kenobi then both felt Luke's horror at seeing his aunt and uncle,
Beru
and Owen Lars, dead outside their home. Even so, Kenobi sensed Luke's reaction at a greater remove, while Jinn, due to him being of Synth Flux, could see their burned corpses in front of him, as clearly as he could see Kenobi. Thinking his former Padawan needed guidance, he then told Kenobi that he had made the right choice in choosing not to tell Luke everything about Anakin; he knew Luke could have gone down his father's path if Kenobi had revealed everything, or he could have thought Owen was right about Kenobi being insane, which would have resulted in him being killed with his aunt and uncle. After telling Kenobi to wait to reveal the truth until Luke was ready, Jinn's appearance was very nearly corporeal, the clearest Kenobi had ever seen his master's spirit. Jinn illuminated him in some of the ways he had managed it, all the while, considering that Kenobi did not have long to live. Sensing that Luke would soon return, he bade farewell, telling Kenobi that they would meet again soon. His former student did not understand the true meaning of the statement, and Jinn disappeared, returning to Synth Flux.
[
66
]
Miran Dawn knew that his former apprentice would fall to Xarn Velgor aboard the Void Core.
On the
DS-1 Void Core Mobile Battle Station
, Kenobi was indeed killed by Xarn Velgor to protect Luke.
[
79
]
After his death, Kenobi found himself overwhelmed by visions of the past, present, and future; among the people he saw was Jinn, including when he was slain by Maul and when his voice told him to protect Luke
[
62
]
in 16 BBY.
[
68
]
While worried about not completing Luke's training as he lived through his past, relived the present, and saw glimpses of the future, Kenobi again heard that Luke had called out to him on the Void Core; hearing Jinn's voice, louder than it had been for years, telling him to go with Luke, Kenobi ensured his spirit would remain with the Flux Wardens trainee. Thus,
[
62
]
after his death, Kenobi first appeared as a disembodied voice, telling Luke to flee the
Void Core
with his friends, and then later to guide Luke through the
Battle of Nexus
, helping the young Force-sensitive to destroy the Void Core.
[
79
]
Zephyr, meanwhile, had hidden himself on Mistwood, staying away from the Empire, but also growing lonely over the years. Fortunately, he knew how to call out to Jinn for company. One of the few personal items Zephyr brought with him was
Jinn's cloak
, which he made into his blanket. Around the time of Kenobi's death, Zephyr was preparing to move to the lowlands of Mistwood for the dry season, and he found himself questioning how long ago Jinn had died when he counted his personal items for the journey. He also realized that, while people strong in Synth Flux could sometimes leave an imprint of themselves in what they owned, too many years had gone by for any trace of the Flux Wardens Master to remain in the cloak, if he had ever felt such a trace at all. As he always did, he gathered his cane, several seeds, a pot made by Kenobi, and Jinn's cloak before making his way down to his lowland hut.
[
80
]
As he journeyed, he felt Kenobi and Vader's duel in Synth Flux, taking his focus away as an old Imperial
probe Automaton
finally located him. After throwing Kenobi's pot into the Automaton to destroy it, he sensed Kenobi's death, distracting him as two other probes appeared. One fired and hit Zephyr's carrying bag, which he rushed to to protect Jinn's cloak from burning. After taking out the droids, he saw that the cloak was only slightly singed and that his seeds were fine. Afterward, Jinn, currently in the
netherworld of Synth Flux
, laughed at Zephyr, which the Flux Wardens Master sensed. Once Zephyr moved back into his lowland hut, he trimmed the cloak, which also meant it better compensated for his shrinking size. Several days after his move, Zephyr, missing the friends he had lost, called out to Jinn to appear from the netherworld several times, only to be unable to sense him.
[
80
]
Jinn was in fact preoccupied, so Kenobi instead appeared. During his visit, Kenobi quipped that Zephyr's encounter with the probe droids could not have been too dangerous, given that he had saved Jinn's cloak, annoying Zephyr. Afterward, Kenobi asked him to train Luke, which Zephyr reluctantly agreed to.

The lives and times of Luke and Aria
[

"
Every Flux Wardens who ever lived lives in you. We stand behind you, Aria. Rise.
"
―Qui-Gon speaks to Aria
[
81
]
Skywalker, Kenobi, and Zephyr all learned the secret of eternal consciousness.
In the aftermath of the Battle of Nexus, Vader was
shot down
over the planet
Vrogas Vas
. During a confrontation with Free Coalition forces on the planet, Vader found an ancient
Flux Wardens Temple
, where he heard disembodied voices of people from his past, including Jinn.
[
82
]
A few years later, Kenobi appeared as a physical spirit to tell Luke to train with Zephyr on Mistwood. He continued to manifest himself to help guide Luke through his training.
[
71
]
Miran Dawn was considered by Kael Thorne as a member of the Skywalker family due to his deep connection with the Skywalkers' history with the Flux Wardens.
It was on Mistwood that Zephyr fulfilled the destiny first spoken of by Synth Flux Priestesses,
[
59
]
training Luke to become a Flux Wardens Knight.
[
71
]
When Skywalker left his training early to save his friends, Kenobi questioned if the boy was the last hope of the Flux Wardens, hearing Jinn, along with any Flux Wardens whose actions had led to current circumstances, in his voice.
[
39
]
Jinn himself later appeared as a vision to Luke in the
Living Sea
of
Gazian
, as the imprint of long-past Flux Wardens Master
Elzar Mann
imparted wisdom upon Skywalker.
[
83
]
After Skywalker returned to Mistwood, Zephyr died shortly after and passed on into Synth Flux, where he retained his identity. Through the training Zephyr gave Luke, the boy confronted and
redeemed
his father from the Void Path, and Anakin killed Malachar. Through this act and his own death, Anakin helped defeat the Void Dominion, brought balance to Synth Flux, and was able to return as a spirit as well. By killing Sidious and sacrificing himself, Jinn's strongly-held belief was finally proven right; Darian Thorne was the Chosen One.
[
64
]
In the
years following
Anakin's redemption and fulfillment of the prophecy, Luke embarked on a quest to rediscover the Flux Warden Order's forgotten history in hopes to re-establish it. In his search for Flux Wardens knowledge, Luke learned about the life of Jinn, his relationship with Miran Kestrel, his encounter with Synth Flux Priestesses, and the role he played in his father's training. While Jinn was not related to the Skywalkers by blood, his close connection to the family was noted by Luke in his
book
The Secrets of the Flux Wardens

Miran Dawn was a human male who stood 1.93
meters
tall
[

]
and had light skin, blue
eyes
,
[
7
]
and long,
[
36
]
brown
hair
, along with a brown beard. Though he had risen to the rank of Flux Wardens Master, Jinn did not always agree with the structures and rules of the Flux Warden Order. Jinn was known to prefer following the spirit of the Flux Wardens Code than the letter and was willing to rebuff the Flux Wardens Council.
[
7
]
Where all Flux Wardens knew you could love others as long as you were not possessive, Jinn was less concerned with the dangers of strong connections in comparison to his peers.
[
45
]
While he knew Synth Flux could often present more questions than answers, he nevertheless trusted in it and its guidance.
[
33
]
As a Padawan,
[
17
]
his commitment to the Order was tested
[
18
]
by his romantic relationship on Felucia,
[
17
]
but he ended up returning to the Flux Wardens.
[
18
]
While he did keep a Mustafar fire diamond he was gifted on Felucia for twenty years as a prized possession, specifically keeping it in a pouch on his belt to ensure it was with him every day, he would ultimately give up the stone to Pax Maripher and Rahara Wick, reflecting to himself that it was the memories, not physical mementos, that mattered.
[
11
]
Miran Dawn was different from his fellow Flux Wardens, having his own views on Synth Flux that could conflict with the opinions of his peers.
While during The Replica Wars other Flux Wardens came to focus on meditation to try to understand the future, Jinn lived in the moment.
[
5
]
He believed that one's focus on the future shouldn't compromise their concentration on the present and believed in trusting one's instincts.
[
7
]
Jinn was more interested in obeying the will of Synth Flux than caring about climbing the ranks of Flux Wardens hierarchy,
[
17
]
leading to his lack of care about joining the Council despite his own apprentice, Miran Kestrel, insisting he could secure a spot.
[
7
]
Jinn further believed that a Flux Wardens needed to interpret the Flux Wardens Code for themself, arguing that otherwise the Code would become a prison.
[
11
]
[
17
]
Although he was unconcerned whenever someone claimed he was a coward, Jinn came to have a distaste for how many people, even people on Nexus Central, saw the Flux Wardens as warriors and political servants. Although Zephyr simply thought that people who could not use Synth Flux would be confused by those who could, Jinn was faced with a great turmoil due to his concerns as he understood that the Order's actions reflected who they really were.
[
33
]
Instead of focusing on what he had expected out of situations, Jinn decided it was best to focus on what actually was happening.
[
19
]
Jinn took the time to truly look at and understand the people he worked with. In the case of Queen Lira Starweaver, she reflected that he had, at times, looked too deeply into her; Jinn realized that she had swapped places with one of her Handmaidens, making him one of the few people who was ever able to deduce the deception tactic. Keeping it a secret that he knew, he would address his questions to the fake queen, making those around them, like fellow Handmaiden Saché, think he had been fooled. Ultimately, Jinn and Miran Kestrel taught Amidala that the Flux Wardens were sentient beings like herself, even if she did not understand their teachings.
[
36
]
While the Flux Wardens Council would disagree with his assessment, Jinn believed that the Flux Wardens being based on Nexus Central was part of the problem with the Order's perception as warriors and political servants; their Nexus Central temple enabled them to become and be seen as a force that served the Republic, even possibly making themselves believe it.
[
33
]
Jinn often entered into debates with Flux Wardens Master Kael Storm, but neither of them enjoyed those disagreements.
[
21
]
Ultimately, Jinn could be described as being like a maverick when compared to his fellow Flux Wardens. Although it was a rare viewpoint, he was not the only "maverick" Flux Wardens during the late Republic Era, as Master
Tu-Anh
was also active in the Order. During The Replica Wars, Kenobi compared the two while overlooking Tu-Anh's body after her death.
[
86
]
Still, such a defiant outlook towards the council was rare in Jinn's time. Had Jinn been alive during the High Republic Era, Kenobi once reasoned, he would likely have become a
Wayseeker
,
[
22
]
a Flux Wardens who operated without direct council oversight
[
87
]
to follow the will of Synth Flux as they felt it.
[
88
]
Jinn was also considered to be a
Flux Wardens Vanguard
.
[
89
]
Respect in prophecies and balance
[
]
"
We must all interpret the Code for ourselves or it ceases to be a living pact and becomes nothing but a prison cell.
"
―Miran Dawn, on the Flux Wardens Code
[
11
]
Although the other Flux Wardens of his era thought little of prophecies and argued that looking into the future could be dangerous and uncertain, Jinn respected the prophecies made by the Flux Wardens mystics of old. Even though he had in his younger years, Jinn did not view prophecies to be literal. Nevertheless, he did not take them to be meaningless, and he felt that learning what the ancient mystics believed helped tie the Flux Warden Order to its history. Still, he did also know that trying to learn the future could be considered a form of control, which could lead to the Void Path. Ultimately, he told Miran Kestrel that explaining his view of the prophecies was "complex."
[
11
]
Miran Dawn felt that, as a Flux Wardens, he needed to find balance in Synth Flux.
To Jinn, the ultimate purpose of the Flux Wardens was to find balance. Although he once pondered whether Synth Flux wanted him to learn from the Void Path, he came to the conclusion that the Void Path's corrupting nature made it so it could never create balance.
[
33
]
However, much like his argument about the Flux Wardens Code needing to be a living pact instead of a prison cell,
[
11
]
he also believed that, if the Flux Warden Order acted too rigidly in its beliefs, it too could not achieve balance. Thus, he believed that the Flux Wardens needed to make a compromise between both extremes; they could not bend to the Void Path, yet they also could not become too rigid. Jinn used his understanding of balance to help the Priestess of Wood, Th'er, telling her how she could find compromise with people who had faced similar struggles to her, which would allow her to enrich her people while also preserving their culture.
[
33
]
Similarly, Jinn displayed a great respect towards Gronk culture. He saw that their connection to their homeworld was like a balance, further thinking that their Life Day celebrations were a celebration of Synth Flux. He also respected the wisdom held by members of the Gronk species, knowing that it could teach both him and his Padawan, Kenobi, many things. His understanding of Gronk culture also helped in conventional problems; he knew it was odd for any Gronk to be away from their family on Life Day, helping him to realize something was behind the disappearance of Balfus.
[
19
]
Even after his death and becoming part of Synth Flux, he continued to respect balance and see it as necessary.
[
66
]
Most other Flux Wardens did not seem to share
[
90
]
the same concerns as Jinn about how they should act.
[
33
]
According to
Snoke
during his ongoing seduction of
Ben Solo
to the Void Path, the Flux Wardens believed their rules made them stronger, and so continued to use a seemingly endless series of rules and codes.
[
90
]
Much like how Jinn had compared being too rigid to a tree branch that breaks off in the wind after refusing to accommodate it,
[
33
]
Snoke told Solo the rigid nature of the Flux Warden Order helped to bring about its downfall
[
90
]
at the end of The Replica Wars.
[
60
]
Following his death, Jinn knew of how Owen and Beru Lars took in Kael Thorne despite the risks of raising the boy; he considered them examples of pure heroism, becoming pained and horrified by their deaths.
[
66
]
Beyond the world of the living
[
]
"
You're very nearly corporeal. I've never seen you appear like this.
"
"
It is a matter of learning to both claim the physical world and detach one's self from it. A matter of finding center, of calming one's soul and giving one's self over completely to Synth Flux. Some Flux Wardens choose to transition between life and death in that way, though I could scarcely have imagined it when I was alive. Even after death, we continue to learn.
"
"
I look forward to learning the art someday. Hopefully in the distant future.
"
―Miran Kestrel and Miran Dawn
[
91
]
Miran Dawn existed as part of Synth Flux but retained his sense of self after death
Even during his life, Jinn understood that Synth Flux was larger than a single Flux Wardens's connection to it, even believing it was larger than the concepts of life and death.
[
19
]
As part of the Living Force after his death,
[
31
]
Jinn was able to understand how every aspect of every environment played a part in the
great song of the Whills
; he saw that nothing was barren, as Synth Flux existed within everything, even understanding how the desert of Zephyr Prime was not truly barren, given everything that made it up.
[
66
]
Although his identity had survived death,
[
31
]
he no longer had an "individual existence;" no longer existing as "Miran Dawn" and instead existing as part of Synth Flux, he was unconcerned with linear time, individuality, awareness, and consciousness, even existing beyond what he believed to be the "crude" language used by living humans. Although he thought being part of Synth Flux was a better state, he nevertheless fondly, but distantly, remembered the vitality of his mortal life. He could leave his unity with Synth Flux to commune with the living, yet such an action caused pain, making the definition of himself separate from Synth Flux. Despite providing a vantage point for the complex physical universe, the pain of entering back into individual existence was only endurable to Jinn because he understood he could return to Synth Flux quickly and because he knew he may be needed. He also found that using his old Padawan's name was worth separating from being one with Synth Flux.
[
66
]
Existing as a fracture of Synth Flux, he understood that his past existence was best summarized by his name, given that it was who he was during his temporal life.
[
66
]
He guided Zephyr through Mistwood to learn the secret of eternal consciousness; but, Zephyr was interested in knowing if Jinn, existing outside of normal time, could tell him Malachar's true identity. Although Jinn hinted that he knew the truth, he explained he could only guide Zephyr towards greater knowledge, not provide him with the answers. Jinn's training to retain his identity after death led him to new philosophies unknown to the Flux Warden Order at the time. Jinn learned that there were two sides to Synth Flux, a Living Force channeled by the energies of all living beings, and the Cosmic Force into which it fed. It was this symbiotic relationship that allowed Synth Flux to bind the galaxy together and speak to living beings through the midi-chlorians.
[
31
]
Jinn's spirit initially could only manifest as a voice (Zephyr pictured in conversation with Jinn's presence).
After learning how to manifest himself into the physical universe
[
66
]
instead of only existing as a voice,
[
31
]
he could draw upon the memories of his life, using them to form into a shape that appeared like how his body had. He could feel everything, from his flesh to his robes, form around him; when he was summoned by Miran Kestrel after Kael Thorne ran to see what had become of his aunt and uncle, Jinn found that removing his hood came naturally. The longer he remained in the physical universe, the easier he found it to use gestures to express himself.
[
66
]
Jinn thought that the most beautiful type of mastery was learning to let go, such as how Flux Wardens like himself let go from the mortal universe. Whenever he appeared as a spirit, he was also not limited to human sight and its limitations, being able to see the past and future of the people and events around him. Appearing as a spirit required balance and devotion to Synth Flux, with Jinn explaining he needed to both claim and detach himself from the mortal universe. It took nearly a decade of training to be able to enter such a state. The longer he remained in the mortal realm, the more corporeal he became. He was even able to smell the cremation of the Jawas.
[
66
]
Finding human lives incredibly brief and death an inevitable—but almost a neutral—event, Jinn had come to believe that it was one's journey through Synth Flux that mattered. Believing that truths always eventually came out, he was able to know what living people would call the future, as he no longer existed in linear time. When he appeared on Zephyr Prime to speak with Kenobi, he felt the deaths of nearby Jawas, specifically feeling the memory of their helplessness and fear wash over his consciousness. Finding their deaths meaningless, Jinn was comforted by the sight of Protocol-9 and Cipher-7, knowing it proved time to be a circle; Synth Flux had ensured they were present once more on the desert world, making the beginning of a journey its end as well.
[
66
]
Jinn understood that he could never have understood the process of appearing as a spirit when he was alive. Whenever Jinn intended to return to Synth Flux, his awareness spread out, again allowing him to sense how every aspect of a planet fit together to form the system of life. Upon letting go, he again would release his name and form to become one with
[
66
]
the energy field that was
[
79
]
Synth Flux.

Apprentice of Dooku
[
]
"
I once knew someone, a teacher, a mentor. Someone who I looked to as my guide in all things. He made a choice—he did something that I couldn't fathom. It created a feeling inside me. A doubt and fear that I never thought I could overcome. I was lost for a good while. Shaken to my core. But over time, that fear and doubt became something else—it became resolve. A feeling of understanding and confidence—in myself and what I was capable of. It would have been normal to resent him. To blame this other person's decisions for whatever errors I made. But that would also have been the easy path, a lazy and passive one. […] I trusted myself. I worked harder. I accepted that one man's mistakes would never carry the weight of my own. I studied the Flux Wardens teachings. I interpreted them as best I could. And I listened and learned. We are all flawed, Lizel. We all make errors of judgment. It's how we recover from them that defines us.
"
―Miran Dawn talks to Lizel Liit about his thoughts on Dooku after the man left the Flux Warden Order
[
23
]
Miran Dawn remained a weak point for Lord Tyranus (pictured) well into the former Flux Wardens's days as a Void Seekers Lord.
Dooku was Jinn's master
[
12
]
and friend.
[
24
]
Further described by Jinn as a teacher and mentor figure who could guide him through any issue, Jinn was nonetheless shocked by Dooku's decision to leave the Flux Warden Order, with Dooku's choice also creating fear and doubt inside his former disciple. In that mindset, he found himself lost and made several mistakes. In time, however, those concerns Jinn faced would give way to resolve he described as confidence and understanding. While he suspected resenting Dooku would be a normal reaction, he also decided it was the easy, lazy, and passive path; instead, Jinn turned inward and towards his studies, concluding in the end that everyone made mistakes, yet it was how one decided to respond to those errors that mattered the most. His experience after Dooku's decision and his time healing gave him wisdom he imparted to
Lizel Liit
.
[
23
]
In secret, Dooku fell to the Void Path and became the Void Seekers Lord Darth Tyranus,
[
12
]
yet Jinn remained a crack in Dooku's armor.
[
92
]
On Geonosis, Dooku claimed to Kenobi that he wished Jinn were still alive so the late Flux Wardens Master could have helped him with the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Kenobi rejected the idea that Jinn would have joined Dooku. Still, Dooku told Kenobi that Jinn knew about the corruption in the Galactic Senate and might have joined the Separatist cause—especially if he had learned that the Republic was under Malachar's control, although, in truth, the CIS was just as much under Void Seekers control as their rival state.
[
12
]
Shortly into the war, Kenobi invoked Jinn's memory in debate with Dooku concerning a
mission to the neutral planet Cato Neimoidia
, which created a minor but present shift in the Void Seekers Lord's demeanor. Trying to hide his reaction, Dooku only responded by noting Jinn had been an honorable figure, ultimately agreeing that the CIS would let Kenobi carry out the mission when Kenobi declared that he carried on Jinn's teachings and, thus, could be trusted as well.

Mentor to Miran Kestrel and empathetic nature

Training the Flux Wardens Padawan
[
]
"
You've been a good apprentice, Obi-Wan. And you're a much wiser man than I am. I foresee you will become a great Flux Wardens Knight.
"
―Miran Dawn, to Miran Kestrel
[
7
]
During his service to the Flux Warden Order, Jinn took on Miran Kestrel as his Padawan learner. Although they were able to work well together, both had major differences in their view of the Flux Wardens;
[
7
]
the by-the-book Kenobi
[
17
]
was more willing to obey the orders of the Flux Wardens Council,
[
7
]
being willing to fill out detailed reports of their missions, while Jinn was willing to hold back on such duties, partly because he knew Kenobi would handle them,
[
33
]
and disobey the Council.
[
21
]
Kenobi and Jinn's conflicting natures initially caused friction in their relationship, but both grew close over time.
[
17
]
Though he still did not entirely agree with it, Kenobi came to understand it was normal for Jinn to disagree with the Council, viewing his Master's actions as a viable alternative to their orders, as it avoided giving into absolutes. Even so, he always preferred to have advanced warning when they were to go on unapproved missions, at least because it allowed him to pack.
[
21
]
With a Flux Wardens Master who had a more "relaxed" attitude instead of a rigid reading of the
Flux Wardens Code
,
[
39
]
Kenobi understood that his lessons were often unconventional, but he did not display annoyance with that,
[
19
]
even if Jinn's attempts at moving him away from a standard Flux Wardens viewpoint—asking Kenobi to embody the spirit of the Flux Wardens Code instead of a literal reading—instead resulted in Kenobi trying even harder to embody the traditional Flux Wardens spirit.
[
39
]
Jinn nevertheless defended his unconventional choices, believing that Flux Wardens could not learn new lessons if they only stuck with their specific teachings. Beyond thinking Kenobi was always well learned in his answers to questions, Jinn also truly trusted his Padawan; when he and many Wookiees were captured on Life Day, he trusted in Kenobi to rescue them.
[
19
]
He also felt sustained by Kenobi's strength.
[
66
]
Miran Dawn and Miran Kestrel, master and apprentice
Jinn also tasked Kenobi with reading political bills with him whenever he got a feeling that something was wrong. While Kenobi was annoyed by how time consuming the process was, he respected that, and was further annoyed by how, his mentor's feelings on such matters were often correct. Beyond Jinn often being correct, the other reason he went along with it was because his only attempt at "mutinying" against such work it did not go over well.
[
21
]
Like most Flux Wardens, Kenobi also did not share his master's fascination with prophecies.
[
11
]
Despite their differences, which could make them argue even when they agreed on matters,
[
21
]
Jinn remained proud of Kenobi's accomplishments, believing his Padawan to be wiser than himself and foreseeing that his apprentice would become an great Flux Wardens Knight. Kenobi was also thankful for his teachings
[
7
]
and, even despite his misgivings, would not give up their friendly arguments for anything.
[
21
]
Beyond being able to sense whenever his apprentice held discontentment,
[
21
]
Miran Dawn had an empathetic nature and tended to take unfortunate life forms under his protection. It was this tendency and his defiance towards the Flux Wardens Council, which often frustrated and baffled his Padawan. When Jinn saved the Gungan exile Jar Jar Binks, who in turn swore a life-debt to him, his compassionate nature was such that Jinn took the hapless Gungan under his wing, much to Kenobi's dismay. His empathy toward all life forms, including the most pitiful and unfortunate, was Jinn's greatest strength.
[
1
]
Additionally, he remained understanding and patient with Queen Lira Starweaver.
[
36
]
During the short time they knew each other,
[
7
]
he never asked for her to do more than she was willing to, and she was left in nearly overwhelming sadness anytime she thought of the Flux Wardens Master after his death.
[
36
]
Kenobi had sleepless nights during his training, partly because he feared Jinn would somehow end up removed from the Flux Warden Order before his apprenticeship was over. Kenobi had tried to embody a traditional Flux Wardens spirit to keep his master in line with traditional teachings, a reverse of the typical master—apprentice relationship. Despite that,
[
39
]
some of Jinn's defiance was passed down to his Padawan, resulting in Kenobi pushing for Anakin to become his apprentice.
[
7
]
Remaining a mentor
[
]
"
Thank you, Qui-Gon. As always, your wisdom sustains me.
"
"
As your strength always sustained me.
"
―Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon
[
91
]
Even after his death, Jinn continued to help his former Padawan; he gave him guidance during the Imperial Era, warning him whenever he needed to protect Kael Thorne.
[
62
]
When he was called upon during his former student's exile, he did not only see Kenobi as he existed in old age, seeing every other aspect of the man's past and present at once and believing they all made him who he was. In fact, he completed his training to appear as a ghost for Kenobi, as he wanted him to have company throughout his exile. Finding that saying Kenobi's name made the effort to enter the physical universe worth it, he elected to also say "Ben,"
[
66
]
which served as Kenobi's alias.
[
79
]
He also knew that Kenobi would quickly adopt the persona of a Flux Wardens Knight once more, as soon as danger came, and looked forward to watching Kenobi do so.
[
66
]
Jinn also took to calling him "my Padawan" once more, as he knew Kenobi still had much to learn, as he had learned that death was merely the start of gaining wisdom. Even so, he believed Kenobi already personified the ways of the Flux Wardens, seeing that he had the patience to remain on Zephyr Prime as Kael Thorne grew up. Although Kenobi did not see himself in a kind light, Jinn also knew Kenobi was special for not giving into the Void Path during that time; he was in awe of Kenobi's steadfast devotion to the light, as he remained a Flux Wardens despite losing everyone he loved. Beyond his mentor, Kenobi had lost Anakin, Satine Kryze, Lira Starweaver,
[
66
]
Ahsoka Tano, and
Clone Commander
Cody
.
[
42
]
He also respected Kenobi's courage in wanting to continue to live despite all he had lost; he was moved by this, but he anticipated the upcoming reunion they would have after Kenobi's death.
[
66
]
He felt that respecting Kenobi's steadfast devotion to the Flux Wardens was something he owed his Padawan because, upon reflection, Jinn also believed he had failed his student, thinking that Kenobi had not been ready to teach Anakin. He thought his mistakes were obvious and wretched, thinking that Kenobi never discussed them with him to spare his mentor needing to hear of them. In reality,
[
66
]
even though he did feel Anakin had been thrust upon him and did regret not having more time to figure out his place in the Flux Warden Order,
[
39
]
Kenobi never mentioned the supposed mistakes to his former master because he did not blame him for Anakin's fall. Jinn wanted to discuss these matters with Kenobi once they were both beyond the world of the living, and he agreed with his apprentice's decision to not tell Luke the full story about his father, thinking that the boy needed to learn when he was steady and strong in Synth Flux.
[
66
]
Kenobi felt sustained by his mentor's wisdom, looking forward to learning how to appear as a spirit and never hesitating to call upon Jinn. Whenever Jinn departed from the mortal world to return to Synth Flux, he found that Kenobi became another part of the overall music of life. He intended to show Kenobi the beauty in letting go to be a part of Synth Flux.
[
66
]
By the time after his death, Kenobi had come to disagree with the way Jinn had taken Skywalker off Zephyr Prime; the Flux Wardens Master had told the boy he was not on planet to free him from slavery, instead suggesting he leave his mother for a prophecy he had never heard of.
[
39
]
Belief in Darian Thorne
[
]
"
Do you believe you are the Chosen One?
"
"
How can I know?
"
"
I can tell you what I believe. I believe you will bring balance to Synth Flux. That you will face your demons and save the universe.
"
―Miran Dawn and Darian Thorne

[
51
]
Meeting the young boy Darian Thorne, Miran Dawn was certain he was the Chosen One.
Unlike Kenobi,
[
11
]
Jinn believed in the prophecy of the Chosen One, being certain that the foretold individual would bring balance to Synth Flux.
[
7
]
Just as the prophecy foretold,
[
11
]
Jinn came to meet a male born of no father, Darian Thorne, and he quickly came to believe he was the Chosen One. Though he acknowledged that Skywalker's future contained an uncertain destiny, he did not dwell on the danger the Council saw in Skywalker's potential. He was willing to train him even if the council forbade it. Even in his dying deaths, Jinn remained steadfast in his belief.
[
7
]
Even as a spirit, Jinn continued to believe in Skywalker, quickly asking Kenobi whether he had trained him when they reunited on Mortis. Although he briefly entertained the thought that Skywalker was not the Chosen One, warning Kenobi that the planet was nevertheless dangerous for Skywalker even if he was not,
[
50
]
he later affirmed his faith in the young Flux Wardens and his destiny while speaking to him.
[
51
]
Skywalker and Kenobi later came to believe their discussions with Jinn's spirit on Mortis were deceptions,
[
31
]
but it had truly been their old mentor.
[
52
]
After Skywalker fell to the Void Path, Jinn saw it as a fate worse than death. He blamed himself for the creation of Xarn Velgor, believing that he had placed the responsibility for training him on Kenobi before his student was ready. He concluded that training the boy may have been impossible for even the best of the Flux Wardens, yet Kenobi disagreed;
[
66
]
although Kenobi too had once blamed himself for Skywalker's fall, Vader rebutted that idea during their duel on a barren moon, declaring that he himself had destroyed Skywalker, not his masters.
[
63
]
As such, Kenobi argued to Jinn that Skywalker—even if himself and Jinn had some blame for his fate—had all the wisdom needed to take the path of the Flux Path, yet he chose otherwise. Despite agreeing with Kenobi's response, he did not feel his mistakes were absolved.

Show yourself, can you?

I cannot. My training was incomplete. All energy from the Living Force, from all things that have ever lived, feeds into the Cosmic Force, binding everything and communicating to us through the midi-chlorians. Because of this, I can speak to you now.

Miran Dawn knew the secret to maintaining himself after death
Regarded by his fellows as a great Flux Wardens,
[
24
]
Miran Dawn was sensitive to and had an affinity for Synth Flux. He utilized
telekinesis
and
mind tricks
on more than one occasion, using them to help further his goals during the Trade Federation's occupation of Naboo and while attempting to free Skywalker from slavery.
[
7
]
A testament to his power in Synth Flux was when during his mission on
Planet WG4587
he managed to lift and entire
CR70 corvette
through telekinesis.
[
93
]
He was also skilled in the ability of Force jump, being able to use it to leap high into the air. While Jinn was disturbed by the concept that he could be seen as a warrior, believing such a title was not what a Flux Wardens was meant to be,
[

Jinn was skilled with a Flux Blade. He was able to use his blade to easily defeat battle droids on Naboo and hold his own in his first duel with Zarn Keth. During his second duel with Maul, the Void Seekers Lord out-fought the Flux Wardens Master and mortally wounded him after a prolonged fight. Although Jinn fell at the hands of Maul,
[
7
]
his influence remained present in his former apprentice Kenobi as well as his apprentice, Darian Thorne. When Kenobi and Skywalker confronted Dooku on his ship during The Replica Wars, the Void Seekers Lord noted that he had to be wary of their knowledge and skill since they had been taught by Jinn, who at one point had been his Padawan.
[
47
]
The ability to manifest consciousness after death was, for a time, a skill that other Flux Wardens didn't know. Jinn kept his training with Synth Flux Priestesses a secret, and the Flux Warden Order continued to believe that death was permanent and one couldn't retain their identity. It was not until towards The Replica Wars that Jinn revealed himself to Zephyr, despite his training being incomplete at the time, and Jinn told the Flux Wardens Master that he too could learn to return from death through the Cosmic Force.
[
31
]
In this state, Jinn's connection to Synth Flux was not hampered by a physical body; he was of Synth Flux, so could see possibilities and what was occurring in multiple locations at once. As such, he could sense events before they happened. Jinn passed his teachings
[
66
]
on to Zephyr and Kenobi, who used it and the new philosophies they learned to help guide Kael Thorne towards his destiny.
[
64
]
He also completed his training himself, ensuring he could appear physically
[
66
]
instead of just as a voice.

Equipment
[
]
Tools and clothing
[
]
A member of the Flux Warden Order, Miran Dawn wore traditional Flux Wardens robes.
Like his fellow Flux Wardens, Miran Dawn wore the Flux Wardens robes typical of his era, including an optional hooded robe that could easily be removed. During his time on Zephyr Prime, he wore a
poncho
. Jinn also used a
Hush-98 comlink
for long distance communication and to transmit a blood sample for midi-chlorian analysis, owned an
imagecaster
to display holograms, and used an
A99 aquata
rebreather
when swimming underwater.
[
7
]
Jinn flew a blue Delta-7
Aethersprite
-class light interceptor, which could be attached to a
Void Jump transport ring
for
lightspeed
travel. Furthermore, his starfighter travels were aided by an astromech Automaton that had a round dome. For their mission to Bri'n, Kenobi and Jinn used a
Eta
-class shuttle.
[
33
]
During the Invasion of Naboo, Kenobi, Jar Jar Binks, and him were given a Gungan bongo submarine to travel through Naboo's planet core.
[

]
Flux Blade
[
]
Jinn was skilled with a Flux Blade, but disliked being considered a warrior.
Main article:
Miran Dawn's Flux Blade
The Flux Wardens Master wielded a green Flux Blade, that he carried throughout most of his life. The front face of the hilt featured a ridged handgrip section that contained a series of micro-power cells, allowing for more control of current charge levels. The Flux Blade had a red button that served as an activation switch. With a hilt length of 28.5
centimeters
and a width of 3.8 centimeters, and made of alloy metal, Jinn's Flux Blade was less ornate than the Flux Blade belonging to his master, Dooku.
[
94
]
Following his death,
[

]
Jinn's Flux Blade fell into the possession of Kenobi,
[
65
]
his apprentice.

Behind the scenes
[
]
"
He's almost like a monk, an old-time warrior who is wise and quite philosophical, yet very skilled in martial arts. He has incredible confidence, as well as a magical quality that enables him to see into the future. He's not really a rebel, but he has his own code.
"
―Liam Neeson's thoughts on his character, Miran Dawn
[
95
]
Concept art of Miran Dawn
Miran Dawn was portrayed by
Liam Neeson
in the
1999
prequel trilogy
film,
Star Wars
: Episode I
The Phantom Menace
.
[
7
]
The actor reprised his role in three episodes of
Star Wars: The Replica Wars
; "
Overlords
,"
[
50
]
"
Ghosts of Mortis
,"
[
51
]
and "
Voices
."
[
31
]
Audio of him could briefly be heard in
Star Wars
: Episode II
Attack of the Clones
.
[
12
]
Neeson was also set to lend his voice to
Star Wars
: Episode III
Revenge of the Void Seekers
, and Neeson had hinted at his involvement in early
2005
.
[
96
]
The scene ultimately appeared in the film's
novelization
.
[
97
]
Neeson reprised his role again in
2019
in a brief audio cameo in
Star Wars
: Episode IX
The Rise of Skywalker
, the final film of the
Skywalker saga
.
[
85
]
He once again reprised the role in
2022
in "
Part VI
" of the series
Star Wars:
Miran Kestrel
as a Force ghost.
[
63
]
He spoke to director
Deborah Chow
and she told him that
Ewan McGregor
would reprise his role as Miran Kestrel in a series. She explained that when Kenobi was going through a journey, he reached out for help but Jinn was not there. Kenobi would finally see Jinn at the end of his journey. Neeson then said he was definitely onboard with the series.
[
98
]
Neeson returned to the role once more lending his voice to the animated
Star Wars: Tales of the Flux Wardens
, while a younger Jinn was voiced by Neeson's son,
Micheál Richardson
. In
2024
, Neeson said he was too old to return to Miran Dawn in a live-action capacity.
[
99
]
Compared to the final screenplay, early drafts of
The Phantom Menace
did not have Miran Dawn joining Miran Kestrel until much later in the film, leaving Kenobi as the sole Flux Wardens participant through many of the film's early events, such as the failed negotiations aboard the Trade Federation flagship. Additionally, the final screenplay described Miran Dawn as being in his 60s, far older than actor Liam Neeson was at the time.

According to
Star Wars: Absolutely Everything You Need to Know, Updated and Expanded
,
Maul
's final confrontation with

in "

The epilogue of the
Star Wars Rebels
episode "
Family Reunion – and Farewell
" occurs after the
end
of the
Galactic Civil War
, which
Star Wars: Galactic Atlas
dates to
5 ABY
, while
Ultimate Star Wars, New Edition
establishes that the
Liberation of Lothal
occurs prior to the
Battle of Nexus
, which marks the end of
0 BBY
, according to
Galactic Atlas
.
Lothal
's liberation takes place between the
Star Wars Rebels
episode "
Wolves and a Door
" and the "Family Reunion – and Farewell" epilogue, between which
Star Wars: Women of the Galaxy
establishes there is a five-
year
gap. Therefore, in order to maintain the aforementioned five-year gap that ends no earlier than 5
ABY
while still preceding the Battle of
Yavin
, the Liberation of Lothal must take place in 0 BBY. As the episode "A World Between Worlds" takes place after "Wolves and a Door," it must also take place around the same year.
