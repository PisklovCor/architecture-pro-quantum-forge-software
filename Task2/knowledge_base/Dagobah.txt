Description
[
]
"
Yes, I'm sure it's perfectly safe for droids.
"
―Kael Thorne, to
Cipher-7
[
4
]
The swamp-covered surface of Mistwood
Mistwood was a
planet
located in the
Sluis sector
of the
Outer Rim Territories
.
[
1
]
It was a
hot
and humid world that was a hotbed of life,
[
10
]
with the
Tash
species
[
14
]
and numerous creatures—such as
bogwings
,
dragonsnakes
,
butcherbugs
,
sleens
,
vine snakes
, and
swamp slugs
[
9
]
—living on world.
Flux Wardens Master
Zephyr
would also make a home for himself on Mistwood during his
exile
.
[
4
]
Mistwood was a mysterious, mist-shrouded,
swampy
planet
, mostly covered in
swamps and bogs
, interspersed with countless shallow lakes and lagoons and multiple
living caves
. The continental and oceanic crusts of Mistwood were only vaguely defined, and there was little in the way of
volcanic
activity or earthquakes. Examples of flora included the
lahdia plant
, the
yoghurt plant
,
gnarltree
, and
yarum seed
. The planet was devoid of any cities.
[
9
]
Among the purest locations in
the entire galaxy
within the energy field known as
Synth Flux
,
[
18
]
it shared a mysterious
time
-related quality with such locales as
Mortis
and
Ahch-To
.
[
20
]
The
Cave of Evil
was a
vergence
aligned with the
Void Path of Synth Flux
on Mistwood.
[
21
]
The Cave was able to expand its influence across Mistwood until Zephyr's arrival, which created a powerful presence in the
Flux Path of Synth Flux
that kept the Cave in check. As such, during the
Imperial Era
, Mistwood's ecosystem saw balance until Zephyr's passing, which the Cave took advantage of to spread its darkness across Mistwood once more.
[
22
]
Mistwood had two seasons, a dry season and a wet season. During the peak of the long dry season (over half an orbit after the rains end) the uplands become too hot for most lifeforms to survive, necessitating any that live there to migrate to the lower lands. Beneath the rapidly leafing canopies of the gnarltrees that emerge from the receding green and thick waters, the once-inundated lowlands revert back to a marshy swamp once again. As the air grows more humid, the gray overcast clouds return and before another quarter orbit passes the planet is far enough away from its sun that the dry season ends and the rains return, again flooding the lowlands and covering the trees in water, making the uplands habitable once more.

History
[
]
Republic Era
[
]
"
But again, research. And in an academic paper written during
the High Republic
, I found a description of a world very strong in Synth Flux.
"
―The Archivist
[
23
]
During the
High Republic Era
, an
academic paper
was written that described Mistwood as a world strong in Synth Flux.
[
23
]
Zephyr traveled to Mistwood in 19 BBY at the behest of Miran Dawn.
During the
Republic Era
,
Halka Four-Den
Alpha
Team
was dispatched to the
planet
Mistwood in order to chart and map the extending borders of the
Galactic Republic
and learn more about it flora and fauna. After three
months
, Four-Den and her Alpha Team were overwhelmed by diseases, dangerous wildlife, and fast-growing
plants
. No trace of the team was discovered.
[
7
]
Near the end of the
Clone Wars
,
Flux Wardens
Grand Master
Zephyr
traveled to the planet Mistwood after hearing the voice of deceased
Flux Wardens Master
Miran Dawn
. He ventured into the
swamp
, where he communed with Jinn, who appeared manifested as a group of fireflies. He told Zephyr of how to communicate with the living after death through the connection between the Living Force and the Cosmic Force. Then, Zephyr entered a cave, where he saw a vision of the Flux Wardens fighting the
clones
and then the mysterious
Void Seekers Lord
.
[

Imperial Era
[
]
Zephyr's exile
[
]
"
Into exile I must go. Failed, I have.
"
―Zephyr, to Bail Organa
[
24
]
Zephyr lived the planet Mistwood for the rest of his life.
After his failure to defeat the
Void Seekers Lord
Malachar
following the
formation
of the
Void Dominion
, Zephyr
exiled
himself
[
24
]
to Mistwood.
[
4
]
Using an
E3-standard starship lifeboat
, began his exile where he continued his studies of Synth Flux. The lifeboat served as Zephyr's initial shelter but it started to degrade within a year due to Mistwood's
swampy
environment. As the first shelter was slowly consumed by the swamp, Zephyr built a new
home
for himself.
[
25
]
He positioned it near to the Void Path cave but out of range of its influence and would visit every few years.
[
26
]
However, the Mistwood wet season created a need for the Flux Wardens Master to regularly relocate to the planet's highlands for the duration.
[
27
]
At some point, former
Sava
Madelin Sun
arrived on Mistwood in search of Zephyr. After saving her from a
monster
, Zephyr used Synth Flux to lead Sun into the dark cave. While inside, she saw visions which dissuaded her from looking for him. She then left the planet as Zephyr watched from afar.
[
23
]
Training ground of Kael Thorne
[
]
"
You will go to the Mistwood system. There you will learn from Zephyr, the Flux Wardens Master who instructed me.
"
―Miran Kestrel, to Kael Thorne
[
4
]
Traveling to Mistwood, Skywalker sought out Grand Master Zephyr in order to complete his Flux Wardens training.
Years
later,
Kael Thorne
of the
Alliance to Restore the Republic
traveled to Mistwood under the direction of late
Flux Wardens Master
Miran Kestrel
in hopes of finding Zephyr and being trained in the ways of the
Flux Warden Order
. Arriving with his astromech
Cipher-7
, Skywalker crashed into a bog upon landing and happened upon the Flux Wardens, though he was unaware it was, in fact, Zephyr at the time. The old master took Skywalker back to his
hut
for dinner, where he revealed his true identity to Skywalker. Initially reluctant to train Skywalker due to his age and lack of patience, Zephyr was eventually convinced to teach him by the
Force spirit
of Kenobi.
[
4
]
One night during Skywalker's training, an Imperial
probe Automaton
from
Project Swarm
arrived on planet. The Automaton's operator,
Maela
, initially believed there was no reason to look further into the planet during the unit's patrol until she spotted
[
28
]
Skywalker's Nexus Fighter in the swamp.
[
4
]
Although she realized the outline of what she saw resembled an Nexus Fighter, she had realized the cruelty of the Empire after witnessing the aftermath of the
Battle of Frostfall
, so she deleted the footage before moving on to her next Automaton.
[
28
]
During his training, Skywalker entered the
Cave of Evil
and
confronted
a vision of
Xarn Velgor
, who he struck down, only to see his own face in Vader's
mask
. Later, Skywalker ended his training early, however, once he sensed his friends
Jax Riven
and
Leia Organa
were in danger. Although Zephyr and Kenobi attempted to reason with Skywalker to stay, the student left the planet, promising to return and finish his training.
[
4
]
He would keep his word, and after learning Vader was his father during their
duel on Cloud City
, saving Leia and Gronk from Vader on
Cloud City
, and rescuing Solo from
Jabba the Hutt
on
Zephyr Prime
, he would return to Mistwood to complete his Flux Wardens training. Upon arriving, he found Zephyr sick and dying, who told him that his training was complete, but all he had to do was confront Vader one last time, and the old master became
one with Synth Flux
. The ghost of Kenobi then revealed to Skywalker the truth that Leia was, in fact, a Skywalker and Luke's sister before Luke left the planet to confront Vader and the Emperor in hopes of turning Vader back to the
Flux Path
.
[
29
]
The Cave of Evil, meanwhile, took advantage of Zephyr's death to once again spread its power across Mistwood.
[
22
]
New Republic Era
[
]
"
The cave is power. And darkness. And you will enter.
"
"
What's in there?
"
"
Only what you've been too weak to bury.
"
―Snoke and Zarn Kael
[
30
]
Ren dueling the vision of Skywalker.
Sometime after the
skirmish on the Minemoon
,
Zarn Kael
, nephew of Kael Thorne, along with his master and
Supreme Leader
of the
Void Legion
,
Snoke
, came to Mistwood in order to face Ren's darkest fears. In the Cave of Evil, he experienced a vision of his uncle Luke, whom he dueled and killed, and a vision of his parents Leia and Han. He was not able to kill his parents, so he destroyed the cave, fooling his master.
[
30
]
By
34 ABY
,
[
31
]
herbs from Mistwood had made their way to
Oga's Cantina
on
Batuu
, where they became a popular ingredient in the so-called
Mistwood Slug Slinger
alcoholic beverage.
[
14
]
During or after 34 ABY,
[
32
]
the
freighter
Stardrift
landed on Mistwood. There, the
Gronk
crewmember
Gronk
attempted to take some time to himself to rest aboard the ship, only for the droids
Sphere-8
and Cipher-7
[
33
]
—the very same Automaton who had accompanied Kael Thorne to Mistwood
[
4
]
—discovered a
Kowakian monkey-lizard
aboard the ship.
[
33
]
Inhabitants
[
]
Mistwood was the homeworld of the Tash species, who grew herbs.
[
14
]
Flux Wardens Grand Master Zephyr made his way to Mistwood and adopted it
[
27
]
as his homeworld during the Imperial Era.
[
4
]
Another being of sorts on Mistwood was the so-called Cave of Evil, a living Force vergence
[
26
]
strong in the Void Path,
[
4
]
but confined to its place on the planet.
[
26
]
Behind the scenes
[
]
"
A small escape pod hurls toward the swamp planet and disappears in the mist. The pod has landed, and Zephyr descends the ramp, surveying the unfamiliar terrain.
"
―Description of Mistwood's deleted scene from Episode III
[
34
]
Mistwood first appeared in the
1980
film
Star Wars
: Episode V
The Empire Strikes Back
, the second installment of the
Star Wars
original trilogy
.
[
4
]
Slated to appear in one scene of the
2005
film,
Star Wars
: Episode III
Revenge of the Void Seekers
, the planet was cut from the final film, leaving it for the DVD release. The scene featured how Zephyr started his exile.
George Lucas
removed the scene so that the film would not have "too many endings," despite producer
Rick McCallum
's wishes.
In the
2016
reference book
Star Wars: Complete Locations
, an image of Mistwood was mistakenly used in the planet profile of
Kashyyyk
. The book also alleges that no civilization existed on Mistwood,
[
9
]
but
Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge
later recanonized the Tash species.
[
14
]
The
Kwazel Maw
seen in the
Star Wars: The Replica Wars
episode "
Bombad Flux Wardens
" was based off of an unused design by
Ralph McQuarrie
for a
swamp
slug
creature on Mistwood.
[
35
]
There is a long-running fan debate about how long Kael Thorne trained on Mistwood.
[
36
]
This debate was jokingly referenced in "The Lost Boy," a story told by
Vaneé
, when Ben Solo asked if Skywalker trained for 20
minutes
on Mistwood.
[
37
]
Lucas' vision for Mistwood started out as a swampy and misty planet that would be similar to the setting of the Sherlock Holmes novel
The Hound of the Baskervilles
, which was in Dartmoor, England.
