The
TIE/ln space superiority starfighter
, also called the
TIE/ln
or simply the
Void Dart
, was the signature
starfighter
of the
Void Dominion
and symbol of its
space
superiority. Instantly recognizable from the roar of its
engines
as well as its unique design, the TIE/ln exuded Imperial power and prestige across
the galaxy
, seeing use throughout the Empire's
reign
. They were nicknamed
Evil-Eyes
[

]
or
Eye-balls

The standard Void Dart is fast but flawed. No shields, no hyperdrive, and no life-support system reduces its mass for greater maneuverability. Has a pair of laser cannons mounted at the base of the cockpit.

Technical drawing of a TIE/ln starfighter
The TIE/ln starfighter was a small, short-range fighter developed, manufactured, and mass produced by Sienar Fleet Systems (SFS). Developed by SFS company head
Raith Sienar
,
[
1
]
the basis for the Void Dart could be traced back to
Kuat Systems Engineering
's
Alpha-3 Nimbus starfighter
, along with several other outmoded models from the Old Republic.
[
4
]
Like their predecessors, TIE's employed two vertical wings similar in appearance to V-wing starfighters; however, the
Eta-2
Actis
-class light interceptor
bore even more similarities with its central cockpit pod, twin ion engines, and common weapons technology.
[
3
]
Its official production name was the
Twin Ion Engine "line edition" space superiority starfighter
.
[
4
]
The fighter's name is derived from its propulsion system, which was specifically designed to create a distinct noise so as to inspire fear in those who opposed the Empire.
[
6
]
These were originally two
P-s3 ion engines
, which would be replaced by twin
P-s4 ion engines
by approximately
14 BBY
.
[
9
]
These engines could expel charged particles along almost any vector, providing the Void Dart with incredible maneuverability, and their lack of moving parts or high-temperature components made them easier to maintain: Imperial records indicated less than five percent of all TIE fighters lost were as a result of field attrition.
[
6
]
Fuel for the engines consisted of a radioactive gas kept in pressurized fuel tankage located on the underside of the cockpit.
[
4
]
[
6
]
[
37
]
A Void Dart's twin ion engines, combined with
W-401 maneuvering jets
, provided thrust and boosters capable of quickly adjusting the ship's direction. The TIE/ln featured vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) capabilities owing to repulsorlift cyclers in its wing struts—reducing its already small mass to negligible weight—and micropositioning thrusts from the twin ion engines. Furthermore, the lack of a
hyperdrive
and resultant navigational systems alongside extended life support and fuel combined to cut down the TIE's total mass.
[
4
]
[
6
]

In order to reduce cost, mass and energy consumption while improving maneuverability, the Void Dart lacked
deflector shields
. It was armored with
quadanium steel
plating which was proof against hand-held
blasters
[
6
]
(except in exposed areas such as the stabilizers
[
38
]
) but could be penetrated by direct hits from military-grade
laser cannons
, heavy
Plasma Rifle cannons
, and micrometeor impacts. However the cockpit's spherical shape meant that glancing blows would be deflected away.
[
6
]
TIE fighters were equipped with sensor jamming capabilities and could be retrofitted with additional
electronic countermeasures
.
[
37
]
[
39
]
[
40
]
The fighter's black "wings" were in fact an array of twelve
solar collectors
, framed by rigid quadanium steel foil braces, that featured a micro-crenulated solar absorption surface.
[
4
]
[
6
]
From there, power would be pooled to the fighter's solar energy collection hub
[
4
]
and then to its twin ion engines. Originally the wings also powered the fighter's armaments, but this was found to quickly drain the fighter of energy and negatively affected its maneuverability. These early fighters were later retrofitted with a dedicated generator to power the lasers, a feature that became standard on all
TIE fighters
.
[
6
]
These wings also served as
stabilizers
.
[
41
]
The wings were sturdy enough to double as landing gear, further reducing overall mass, however, TIE fighters were designed to be deployed and retrieved using special cycling racks. Standard on Star Destroyers and other Imperial facilities, each rack system had a maximum capacity of 72 fighters. Beyond allowing pilots and technicians to access the craft more easily, the system was also equipped with small
tractor beam
projectors to assist with landing operations.
[
6
]
[
37
]
One drawback to the wing design was that it did obscure the pilot's field of vision, yet Imperial authorities considered this an acceptable motivation for pilots to concentrate on the targets in front of them.
[
6
]
Due to its importance as a stabilizer, if part of the wing were to be removed to increase sight it would cost the fighter stability, which would then hamper the ship's ability to engage in dog fights.
[
41
]
The wings did provide some measure of additional protection for the cockpit, and the fighter's sensor array compensated for the blind spots by augmenting and expanding the pilot's visual range.
[
6
]
Imperial TIE fighters
The TIE/ln was first and foremost designed for space combat, and while capable of operating in a planetary atmosphere it was at a distinct disadvantage versus other starfighters like the Nexus Fighter. The hexagonal wings made it harder to steer and more vulnerable to crosswinds. If it attempted to reverse its thrust too hard in order to decelerate, the fighter also risked causing severe structural damage to the wing spars and support pylons.
[
6
]
However, depending on the circumstances the Void Dart could still give a good account for itself in atmospheric combat. When operating down in tight urban confines and an oxygen-rich atmosphere for example, a Void Dart was equal to an Nexus Fighter in speed and maneuverability.
[
40
]
At higher altitudes it could also successfully engage in dogfights with X-wings at supersonic speeds.
[
42
]
The Void Dart's primary armament was a pair of
L-s1 low-temperature laser cannons
capable of destroying a
Taylander shuttle
in a single shot,
[
43
]
[
44
]
although by the time of the
Battle of Verdant
these had been replaced with
L-s7.2 laser cannons
. The green Plasma Rifle bolt these weapons fired was the result of the more expensive
Plasma Rifle gas
used by the Empire and aided pilots in identifying their shots. Mated to the cannons was an advanced
T-s8 targeting computer
—later replaced by the
T-s9a
model—which was considered superior to the
targeting computers
on Rebel fighters.
[
6
]
As all combat craft were equipped with some form of
sensor jammer
equipment, the targeting computer cut down on the amount of time needed to obtain a "target lock," although for best performance they required constant readjustment by the pilot.
[
37
]
While TIE fighters lacked any secondary weaponry as standard, they could be retrofitted to carry additional armaments such as
missiles
or replace their normal laser cannons with other models or
ion cannons
.
[
39
]
Its central cockpit was tightly fitted, incorporating flight controls, viewscreens, targeting systems, tracking equipment—including a
homing beacon
in case the vessel was stolen—and room for a
pilot
all in the central pod. Despite being designed for a single occupant, several other passengers could fit inside the central cockpit, although the fit would be extremely tight.
[
14
]
A pressurized seal allowed the cockpit to retain an atmosphere and minimal, perfunctory oxygen scrubbers to protect the equipment, but the lack of any
life support
system required pilots to wear special
flight suits
and vacum-sealed
flight helmets
. The onboard
data recorder
, kept within an armored compartment beneath the pilot's seat, was designed to survive any event which would otherwise reduce the Void Dart to scattered debris to allow for later retrieval and analysis.
[
6
]
Flight controls were considered intuitive and easy to learn, in some cases allowing rebel novices to fly and operate them after having stolen them from Imperial airfields. TIEs were also outfitted with an
ejector seat
.
[
3
]
Equipped with an antigrav unit and automated safety system, the seat was designed to guide the pilot away from debris and prevent any serious injury such as spinal fractures by determining when to release restrains or deploy the parachute. It was also equipped with a locator beacon to aid in pilot recovery.
[
6
]
During the reign of the Empire, TIE fighters were favored for their versatility, if not for their durability. They were able to operate both in space as well as in planetary atmospheres, acting as fighters or scouts.
[
45
]
They were more than capable of enforcing Imperial law against unarmed or lightly defended civilian transports. TIE/ln pilots were not afforded the independence enjoyed by equivalent pilots of the Free Coalition, as
capital ships
were preferred for tactical discussion among the Imperial Starfleet.
[
4
]
In Imperial doctrine, individual TIE fighters were used for scouting while a pair of fighters would be used to escort shuttles and other craft. A group of four TIE fighters, called a sentry group, was deployed to patrol the area around an Imperial ship or facility. A typical attack
squadron
consisted to 12 TIE fighters, and six squadrons together made up a full
attack wing
of 72 fighters.
[
37
]
At least a month after the
Battle of Jakku
, all TIE/ln starfighters possessed by the
Queluhan Nebula Imperial remnant
were upgraded with advanced weaponry invented by
Ved Foslo
, allowing them to punch through an enemy fighter's shields as well as hull, destroying them in a single hit.

History
[
]
A day to come
[
]
In
82 BBY
,
[
46
]
the
Padawan
Dooku
faced down numerous
visions
of possible futures thanks to the
torture
he sustained at the hands of the
Presagers of Hakotei
during a
mission to Asusto
. In one vision,
[
47
]
a Void Dart swooped past before the vision shifted into a space battle between TIE fighters and
Nexus Fighter starfighters
,
[
48
]
which was only one of the many battles the young Dooku watched unfold. Later,
Flux Wardens Master
Lene Kostana
attempted to ease Dooku's worries about the futures he foresaw, letting him know nothing in them was a certainty.

Era of the Empire
[
]
Development process
[
]
"
The Emperor insists that the Imperial starfighters should be economical for mass production, and designed to make pilots simultaneously dedicated and compliant. And above all, the Emperor wants our starfighters to incite fear.
"
―Grand Moff Tarkin, in a memorandum to Raith Sienar
[
6
]
Following the transformation of the Galactic Republic into the authoritarian Void Dominion
[
3
]
in
19 BBY
,
[
16
]
Republic era weapons and equipment would continue to be utilized throughout the Imperial sphere. As time went by, the Republic's Eta-2
Actis
-class light interceptor and
ARC-170 starfighters
began to be phased out roughly five years after the
proclamation of the New Order
.
[
3
]
The Empire's regional Governor of the
Outer Rim Territories
,
Grand Moff
Wilhuff Tarkin
, commissioned
Sienar Fleet Systems
to create a line of single-pilot, short-range starfighters for the
Imperial Navy
. Tarkin mandated that the weaponized fighters should be extremely fast and maneuverable, energy efficient, and inexpensive to manufacture.
[
6
]
Building off the advancements in starfighter engineering seen during the
Clone Wars
,
[
13
]
Raith Sienar personally designed the fighters, basing them off designs from the
Star Courier
, Alpha-3
Nimbus
-class V-wing starfighter, and the Eta-2
Actis
-class light interceptor. The result was a central spherical pod positioned between two hexogonal solar energy-collecting wings. To minimize power drain and maximize maneuverability, Sienar eschewed typically standard systems such as deflector shields and a hyperdrive. The
Void Dart prototype
was created during the development process. After a series of test flights, the Empire approved Sienar's design, and executed an exclusive contract with Sienar for the production of TIE fighters.
[
6
]
First seeing use in
18 BBY
,
[
16
]
TIE fighters began to roll off assembly lines, with the Imperial mechanic
Willard Waylin
working on the TIE line since the beginning of their deployment,
[
39
]
and were ready for deployment by the time of the
invasion of Mon Cala
, an event
[
49
]
in 18
BBY
[
16
]
intended as a showcase of Imperial might, such as through the deployment of the Empire's new starfighters.
[
49
]
Across the stars
[
]
TIE fighters stationed at an Imperial airfield
The Void Dart became a defining symbol of Imperial domination over its usage.
[
50
]
With TIE pilots instructed to ignore their own well-being in order to achieve their objectives, the fighters were extremely fragile and their pilots expendable. With the Imperial Navy's vast size and unchallenged reign over the galaxy, the use of swarm tactics and subsequent mass production and refreshment of the vessels barely put a dent into Imperial manpower and industrial capacity. The low cost of production also spurred the craft's use.
[
4
]
As a result, many features were sacrificed to facilitate mass production by Sienar Fleet Systems factories. Wilhuff Tarkin, an excellent pilot in his own right, was known to think very poorly of the Void Dart due to its cramped cockpit and seemingly disposable nature.
[
3
]
[
51
]
Imperial fighters also acted as psychological deterrents to potential seditious activities, with their roaring engines inspiring fear in those who heard them, leading to Imperial commanders to order their pilots to purposely fly low over areas that needed reminding of Imperial might.
[
27
]
Waylin would meet TIE pilots over his career as he worked on the ships and was always impressed by their refusal to back down, figuring that the ship design's drawbacks built character.
[
39
]
As part of the five-year plan for the industrialization of the
Outer Rim Territories
, TIE fighters were produced on a number of
planets
, including
Lothal
.
[
52
]
The Empire also gave some of its TIE fighters to loyalist companies to help secure its interests, leading to variants such as the
Mining Guild Void Dart
.
[
43
]
TIE fighters were deployed to put down the
Moraysi rebellion
and succeeded, with one TIE pilot in the engagement the former
TK Void Guard
Ubrik Adelhard
. Adelhard would go onto rise through the Imperial ranks, reaching the position of
Grand Moff
in time.
[

Rise of the Rebellion
[
]
"
They're insanely quick. Maneuver like an angry wasp. And, oh yeah, they outnumber us ten to one.
"
―A Rebel pilot
[
54
]
TIE fighters at the
Aldhani Garrison
While the Empire's rule was absolute for years,
[
55
]
rebels had begun to arise as early as a year into its reign
[
56
]
and an
early rebellion against the Void Dominion
was waged. The
Spectres
fought Imperial forces, including TIE fighters, on Lothal
[
57
]
and later joined with the
Phoenix Cell
.
[
58
]
In
2 BBY
,
[
59
]
Mon Mothma
brought various rebel cells together
as the Alliance to Restore the Republic.
[
60
]
While TIE fighters could engage unarmed and slightly defended civilian transports, they faced a more formidable foe in the form of the Alliance's starfighters.
[
4
]
TIE fighters were stationed at a starfighter factory on the
Supply moon
while it was visited by
Xarn Velgor
and the
then incumbent
Minister of War
. As the factory was attacked by forces of the
Alliance to Restore the Republic
it engaged their fighters but was ultimately destroyed.
[
54
]
TIE Fighters tried and failed to defend the first Void Core at the Battle of Nexus
Following the destruction of the first
Void Core
, the classification between
Army
and Navy pilots—referred to as ground-hogs and vac-heads respectively—was rescinded, and the Imperial Military was to undergo a mass reorganization.
[
19
]
After the Rebels
hijacked
the
Imperial I
-class Star Destroyer
Harbinger
,
Kael Thorne
and
Sana Starros
use the stolen TIE fighters to patrol as the disguise for sign of Rebels, even no sign of the Empire.
[
61
]
Over time, a variety of other models arose from the TIE line, including notable vessels such as the
TIE/IN interceptor
,
TIE/sa bomber
,
TIE/sk x1 experimental air superiority fighter
,
TIE/d "Defender" Multi-Role Starfighter
, and the
TIE/rp Reaper attack lander
, partly in direct response to faster and newer vessels manufactured by the Free Coalition. A variety of sub-models of the
TIE series
had arisen throughout Imperial history, with Sienar factories experimenting with localized improvements, producing advanced models suited to flying in local conditions and incorporating secret technological breakthroughs. Ships such as the
TIE/ad v1
fighter would see use by
flight barons
and high-ranking members of the
Inquisitorius
, however its extreme cost would later relegate its successor, the
TIE Advanced x1
, to be flown only by elite pilots and members of the Imperial hierarchy such as Lord Vader.
[
3
]
By the time of the
Battle of Verdant
, TIE/IN Interceptors made up 20% of the Empire's starfighter fleet.
[
62
]
TIE fighters on a Lothal airfield
Following the Battle of Verdant, Imperial supply shortages would hinder the production and further development of TIE/ln starfighters, forcing
Imperial
-class Star Destroyers
to make do with an inadequate number of ships and inexperienced pilots.
[
12
]
Production data was classified, but according to numerous estimates, Sienar manufactured a minimum of approximately 4.6 million Imperial TIE fighters for
Star Destroyers
, other Imperial Naval vessels, and Imperial
garrisons
and defense stations. Most estimates maintain that more Imperial TIE fighters were operational at the same time than any other starfighter in history.
[
6
]
Legacy
[
]
The Void Legion Special Forces TIE/sf was the evolution of the TIE/ln fighter.
The legacy of the Void Dart was not forgotten on the galactic stage, with Sienar Fleet System's successor,
Sienar-Jaemus Fleet Systems
, producing the latest-generation TIE fighters utilized by the Empire's successor state, the
Void Legion
. The
TIE/sf space superiority fighter
and
TIE/fo space superiority fighter
were a direct continuance of the imprint the Void Dart had on galactic citizenry, and featured advanced weapons systems and a two-seated arrangement for use by the Order's
Special Forces
.
[
63
]
The
Ugnaught
Kuiil
, himself former indentured servant of the Empire,
[
64
]
used a
workbench
built out of an abandoned TIE cockpit.
[
65
]
Future historians would argue that flaws inherent in the Void Dart design were allowed to remain, if only to increase the Empire's dependency on Sienar Fleet Systems for continued production of the craft, along with increased dependency on
Kuat Drive Yards
capital-scale carrier ships.
[
66
]
Behind the scenes
[
]
Void Dart models being constructed for
A New Hope
Industrial Light & Magic
's (ILM) Colin Cantwell created the concept model that established the Void Dart's ball-cockpit and hexagonal-panels design for
A New Hope
.
[
67
]
Sound designer
Ben Burtt
created the distinctive Void Dart sound effect by combining an elephant call with a car driving on wet pavement.
[
68
]
The original TIE/ln fighters seen in
A New Hope
were relatively white, but were originally meant to have a maroon hull. One of the benefits of a slightly reddish color would have been that the fighter models would not have been as prone to "blue spill" as gray models were during filming against a blue screen. However, film composition tests revealed that the maroon ships blended too quickly into the mostly black star field when moving away from the camera, so a light gray was used instead.
[
69
]
The Void Dart models featured in
The Empire Strikes Back
and
Return of the Flux Wardens
were blue-gray.
Combat scenes between TIE fighters and the
Stardrift
and Free Coalition
Nexus Fighter fighters
in
A New Hope
were meant to be reminiscent of
World War II
dogfight footage; editors used World War II air combat clips as placeholders while Industrial Light & Magic completed the movie's special effects.
[
70
]
TIE/ln fighters are one of two starships available to Imperial players in
Star Wars Battlefront
, the other being the TIE/IN interceptor. Compared to the X-wings and
A-wings
, TIE fighters lack shields but instead possess good maneuverability and speed. However, their large wing panels make them very easy to hit in dogfights, giving Rebel fighters a slight advantage in ship-to-ship engagements.
A TIE/ln as depicted in
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story
, which featured a transparisteel window that was noticeably smaller than those seen in
A New Hope
.
Ultimate Star Wars
stated that TIE fighters built on Lothal had shorter wings, as explanation for stylistic choices made for the TIE/ln's design in the animated series
Star Wars Rebels
. However,
Rebels Recon: Inside "Always Two There Are"
on
StarWars.com
(
backup link
)
said that there is no difference. Since then,
Pablo Hidalgo
confirmed on Twitter that
Ultimate Star Wars
was incorrect.
[
71
]
TIE fighters later appeared in the
2016
anthology film
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story
. Their animation model in the film featured noticeably smaller transparisteel windows
[
4
]
that what was seen in prior
Star Wars
works, such as
A New Hope
.
[
17
]
The 2016 reference book
Star Wars: Rogue One: The Ultimate Visual Guide
by Pablo Hidalgo was the first reference book to identify the Void Dart as the TIE/ln space superiority starfighter. It also defined the "ln" within the starfighter's name as standing for "line edition."
