Coruscant. The entire planet is one big city.
"
―

Coruscant
(pronounced /
'kɔɹəsɑnt
/), also known as
Jewel of the Core Worlds
, or
Imperial Center
during the
rule
of the
Galactic Empire
, was an
ecumenopolis
—a
city
-covered
planet
, in the
Coruscant system
of the
Core Worlds
. Prior to being covered by over five thousand metallic levels of what would become known as
Imperial City
, Coruscant was the ancient
homeworld
of the
Taung
and
Zhell
species
. Though debated by
historians
, the theory that Coruscant was the ancestral world of
humans
remained unproven. Noted for its cosmopolitan culture and towering
skyscrapers
, Coruscant's population consisted of trillions of
citizens
hailing from a vast array of both
humanoid
and
alien
species. In addition, Coruscant's strategic location at the end of several major
trade routes
enabled it to grow in power and influence, causing the city-planet to surpass its early rivals and become the hub of
galactic
culture, education, finance, fine arts,
politics
and technology. It was the location of several major landmarks, including the
Jedi Temple
,
Monument Plaza
, and the
Senate Building
.
Serving as the
capital
of
the galaxy
since the ancient
days
of the old
Galactic Republic
, Coruscant was at the center of many
historic events
, such as the
Jedi Order
's
conflict
with the
Sith
. Although the planet
fell
under Sith control for a
time
, Republic forces ultimately
liberated Coruscant
with the aid of the
Jedi Knights
. Their victory was so decisive that at one point the Sith became all but extinct, replacing an
age of darkness and strife
with the
democratic rule
of the modern Galactic Republic. Retaining its status as galactic capital, it was on Coruscant where the
Galactic Senate
governed the galaxy for
centuries
, establishing an
era
of
peace
that lasted for almost a
millennium
under the protection of the
Jedi
peacekeepers
. However, political intrigue wrought by corruption and
secession
transformed Coruscant into a dangerous environment by the time of the
Clone Wars
with the
Confederacy of Independent Systems
. On the
eve
of the
New Order
, fulfilling a
grand scheme
,
Supreme Chancellor
Sheev Palpatine
, who was, in fact, the
Sith Lord
Darth
Sidious, declared the Jedi
enemies of the state
, resulting in a
galaxy-wide purge
that all but destroyed the Jedi Order. Without the Jedi to oppose him, Palpatine dissolved the Republic and
declared
himself
Galactic Emperor
to the applause of the now
Imperial Senate
.
Coruscant continued to serve as galactic capital under the Empire, having become the Emperor's
throneworld
, although Palpatine himself disappeared from public view for the most part, leaving the
day
-to-day governing to his
advisors
in the
Imperial Ruling Council
. The Empire maintained a firm hold on Coruscant throughout the Emperor's
reign
, but with his defeat at the
Battle of Endor
in
4 ABY
by the
Alliance to Restore the Republic
, citizens of Coruscant
celebrated
by
revolting
. Unable to command the
military
's allegiance as the rebels
restored
the Republic,
Grand Vizier
Mas Amedda
's rule was limited to Coruscant while
Fleet Admiral
Gallius Rax
, the self-proclaimed
Counselor to the Empire
, assumed
de facto
control of the collapsing Imperial government. Hoping to escape prosecution for war crimes, Amedda ultimately surrendered himself to the
New Republic
in return for amnesty. Following Rax's death at the
Battle of Jakku
in
5 ABY
, Amedda signed the
Galactic Concordance
—a peace treaty recognizing the Empire's
capitulation
and the end of the
Galactic Civil War
. Amedda himself was permitted to return to Coruscant as the head of a
provisional government
. Yet his authority was merely ceremonial; under the supervision of Republic overseers, he became a virtually powerless figurehead.
Unlike previous galactic governments, the
New Republic
broke with millennia of tradition by not establishing Coruscant as their headquarters, instead preferring to designate other member worlds with the status of galactic capital through an electoral system. During the
New Republic Era
, Coruscant had become the capital of the New Republic as it was designed to handle and administer the galaxy's infrastructure. As part of the
New Republic Senate
, Coruscant enjoyed full senatorial representation and, by the time of the
Cold War
, was aligned with the worlds that identified as
Centrists
. However, by this point, Coruscant had actually fallen under the control of crime syndicates. Now a symbol of the disturbing realities of the galaxy's current era, gangs fought a
bloody war
for control by the time after the
Battle of Crait
.
During the
First Order-Resistance War
, at least two sizeable battlegroup were deployed by the
First Order
to Coruscant in the apparent hope of seizing it and ruling the galaxy from the ecumenopolis as the Galactic Empire once did, however these efforts were defeated. In the aftermath of the
Battle of Exegol
, various worlds sought to drive the
First Order military
from their soil. Coruscant was one such world where an
uprising
took place as part of a
galaxy-wide effort
to overthrow the First Order.

leading to the planet gaining the coordinates 0, 0, 0 despite not being in the actual

Due to Courscant's importance in
galactic history
, even later governments such as the
First Order
would even attempt to conquer the planet and make it their
capital
, though their efforts would ultimately fail.

Coruscant was a bustling ecumenopolis, a city-covered planet

The Coruscant week lasted five days, with each days with the name of each day relating to Coruscant is some way—
Primeday

Centaxday
, named after Coruscant's primary moon,
Taungsday

Zhellday
, named after the native Zhell species, and
Benduday
, named after the
Dai Bendu
monks from Coruscant. When the need for a standardized time system between worlds arose in the Galaxy, the
Galactic Standard Calendar
was created, which standardized
days
and
years
to Coruscant's orbital period and rotational period respectively.

From
space
, the bright lights from
Imperial City
, Coruscant's dense multi-layered planet-spanning
city
could be seen,
[
17
]
though it was slightly dimmed by the planet's hazy cloud cover, which were part of the planet's
controlled weather patterns
[

affected by troposphere-piercing
skyscrapers
across Imperial City. While Coruscant's artificial climate was largely temperate in nature, parts of the planet occasionally experienced infrequent snowfall,
[
55
]
and in the
Coruscant Underworld
beneath Imperial City's surface levels, fierce microclimates began to form, forcing the Underworld's many residents to adapt.
[

]
Similarly, Inside the Coruscant's tallest skyscrapers, enormous differences of
temperature
and
air
pressure from top to bottom produced unusual and unpredictable microclimates.

The millennia of urban development on Coruscant left sparse evidence of its pre-ecumenopolis state.
Thousands of years
of development destroyed the planet's ancient
mountains
and
seas
.
[

]
Monument Plaza
housed the top of Coruscant's last remaining mountain peak,
[

that being the peak of the
Umate
. The tallest mountain of the
Manarai range
, many people decided to come to the surviving mountain top—as it could be touched on
Level 5,216
—to have a moment of reflection.
[
19
]
By
232 BBY
,
[
56
]
a dark ring surrounded the peak's base as a result of the countless hands that had touched the rock. Generations of city planners decided to keep the mountain peak. During the
High Republic Era
, the surface around the peak was covered in greenery in an attempt to recreate the
trees
and other
plants
that would have been around the Umate's base many millennia earlier. Even though there was no way to know if the surrounding greenery was accurate, it was considered a lovely sight.

A Golan-II defense platform in orbit of Coruscant
Several of the
Golan defense stations
were located in a fixed-path orbit around the planet.

During the

Imperial City
"
Thousands of layers of buildings and skyscrapers cover the entire planetary surface of Coruscant. Because of this, Coruscant is one of only a handful of city-planets, known as an 'ecumenopolis.'

[

The urban sprawl that covered the surface of Coruscant was known as Galactic City prior to the Imperial Era.
Coruscant's surface was defined by its urban sprawl, which collectively was called
Galactic City
[
1
]
until it was officially renamed as Imperial City during the
Imperial Era
.
[
51
]
The dense city blocks were built on top of each other, with the lowest being
Level 1
and the highest reaching to
Level 5127
.
[
7
]
The lowest known habitable level was
Level 5
.
[
47
]
At its highest level, Galactic City's
skyscrapers
were built with many reaching 6,000
meters
into the atmosphere, with sleek,
transparisteel
edifices standing next to older
duracrete
structures.

As a hustling, bustling planet-wide city with an underworld full of dark alleys and an abundance of people, Coruscant provided the ideal conditions for a
thief
to prosper, especially targeting tourists from quieter planets.
[
58
]
Galactic City was divided into sectors named by designated coordinates. Some sectors also had unofficial names; for example,
sector H-46
was the nicknamed of "Sah'c Town" due to the
Sah'c family
's ownership of much of the sector. Sectors were further divided into zones, with zones determined by purpose, such as financial, senatorial, or industrial zones.
[

The Galactic Senate's headquarters was located in the Federal District of Coruscant.
Under the
Galactic Republic
, the
Federal District
, also called the Senate District, was the center of
political
activity on the planet, as it was home to both the
Senate Building
, seat of the
Galactic Senate
, and the
Senate Office Building
, where the
Supreme Chancellor
had
his
or her own set of
offices
. It served as the main district for government buildings and institutions including the
City Municipal Authorities Building
and the
Galactic Courts of Justice
. The Federal District was also the location of the
Jedi Temple
, headquarters of
Jedi Order
, as well as
500 Republica
, a massive residential tower home to the most powerful on Coruscant.
[
7
]
Under the rule of the
Galactic Empire
, the Federal District was transformed and heavily fortified, and the
Jedi
Temple
was repurposed as the Imperial Palace. The palace became a part of the "supreme triangle" of structures alongside the
Imperial Inspectorate HQ
and the massive
COMPNOR arcology
,
[
31
]
which housed the city-block-sized
ISB Central Office
of the
Imperial Security Bureau
.
[
5
]
Next to the Federal District was the
Verity District
, which under the Empire housed the
Hall of Adjudication
, the
Hall of Imperial Register
, the
Institute to Preserve Imperial History
, and the
ISB Academy and Offices
.

The surface of Coruscant featured towering skyscrapers and streams of speeder-filled air traffic.
The planet's
skylanes
directed the air-traffic of
airspeeders
via auto-navigation system that moved the speeders along preprogrammed routes. As such crashes were extremely rare.
[
5
]
Precautions were taken though with and skytunnels incorporating bombproof shields and high-level tracking systems, and most structures on Coruscant had defensive shields to protect windows from stray and out-of-control vehicles.
[
7
]
Owing to the planet's prominence in terms of galactic affairs, Galactic City housed numerous governmental offices and inter-galactic headquarters in its winding depths. The central planning strategy offices of the food giant
Tagge Corporation
could be found within the city, along with the droid research institutes funded by
Cybot Galactica
, and the
Bank of the Core
, one of the galaxy's largest financial institutions. The towers were symbols of power and authority, and the largest could hold populations of well over a million.
[

]
Coruscant was home to a population of trillions of beings, both humans and aliens, collectively known as Coruscanti.
The planet's residents were known as the
Coruscanti
[
31
]
and of the estimated trillions inhabitants of the planet, 68% were believed to be
human
.
[

On Coruscant, wealth increased with altitude. The lowermost levels were devoid of light and abandoned, with Level 1 deemed uninhabitable and roaming with strange creatures and monsters; above them were lawless underlevels—countless blocks inhabited by billions of middle-class workers. The super-towers on Level 5217 remained home to the ultra-wealthy.
[
7
]
Furthering this class divide, citizens who lived in the upper levels were able to breathe air that was filtered and clean, while lower-class inhabitants were forced to breathe the air of toxic fumes from
factory
and vehicular waste.
[

As such, most visitors to Coruscant chose to bring their own air supply to last the length of their stay.

Early history

"
They say Coruscant used to be like any other planet, with oceans and mountains. But now it's just this, all the way down to Level 0.
"
―Leia Organa

Though unconfirmed, Coruscant was believed to be the ancestral homeworld of the human species.
In ancient times, Coruscant was populated by two
sentient
species
, the
Taung
and the
Zhell
.
[
8
]
Sometime in its distant past, Coruscant was home to a conflict between civilizations that fought for control of the planet. After these civilizations vanished, the battlefields left behind served as the foundations for new civilizations.
[
7
]
Though its connection to the human species was unconfirmed, Coruscant was widely accepted as the human
homeworld
.
[
60
]
Nevertheless, the human
Axel Greylark
claimed that, at least to his knowledge, the people of Coruscant did not have grand creation myths.
[
46
]
In time, humans expanded throughout the known galaxy, exploring and colonizing vast regions of space, with Coruscant becoming the galactic center of political and cultural life.
[

]
In
100,000 BBY
,
[
9
]
the lowest levels of Coruscant,
[
46
]
such as
Level 1
, were once called home by the people of Coruscant. As the planet expanded up, however,
[
47
]
the buildings turned to ancient ruins that were buried. It was believed those low levels were left uninhabitable.
[
46
]
Many different political systems held control over Coruscant during its existence, with these systems ranging from brutal empires and
dictatorships
to
democracies
.
[
19
]
Coruscant was one of the Galactic Republic's original Core World founders, and outmaneuvered its early rivals to become the economic and cultural engine of civilization as it expanded along newly chartered
hyperspace routes
. As these early hyperspace lanes became well-established trade routes, increasing numbers of
alien
species migrated towards Coruscant;
[
7
]
this would accelerate the construction of new residential levels and sectors for the city-world's booming population even as the growth of its rivals slowed.
[
61
]
Coruscant's effective status as the center of the Republic led to it being awarded the coordinates 0-0-0 on all standard navigation
charts
.
[
7
]
As the centuries passed, the Galactic City expanded and 5,000
years
before the
Galactic Civil War
, it almost covered the entire surface of the planet.
[

The Jedi Temple on Coruscant was built upon an ancient shrine of the Sith.
The ancient
Sith Lords
built a
shrine
on Coruscant. When the
Jedi Knights
ousted them, they built their temple over it.
[

During the
Jedi-Sith War
, the
Sith
captured
Coruscant, but it was later reclaimed by the Republic
[
62

in the
Liberation of Coruscant
.
[
63
]
Victory
over the Sith at
Ruusan
[
64
]
led to the birth of the modern Galactic Republic
[
62
]
with Coruscant as its capital.
[
18
]
Beings from across the galaxy emigrated to Coruscant seeking opportunities on the bustling planet. However, many newcomers were ultimately relegated to low-level positions and subjected to a life of crime and violence. Nonetheless, it was largely accepted that whoever controlled Coruscant controlled the galaxy.

Coruscant was the capital of the Galactic Republic and home of the Jedi Order throughout the Republic Era.
Over the millennia representatives gathered in the Galactic Senate for diplomacy and dispute resolutions, creating and enforcing laws, and maintaining peace. As such, Coruscant became known as the galactic capital for thousands of years.

When
cult guide
Marda Ro
reformed the already-radicalized
Path of the Open Hand
into the militant
Path of the Closed Fist

the ensuing

The modern Sith secretly inhabited Coruscant, influencing Republic politics and avoiding detection by the Jedi.
It was towards the end of the
Republic Era
that the Sith
Lord
Darth Sidious
executed his plans for galactic domination, beginning with the
blockade
of
Naboo
, his homeworld that he represented as
Senator
Sheev Palpatine.
[
69

The Sith Order, having survived its near destruction through
Darth Bane
's
Rule of Two
, conspired for generations to reclaim their place of dominance in the galaxy.
[
70

By Sidious' time, the Sith secretly resided on Coruscant in spite of the Jedi Order's presence on the capital. The Jedi at the time were under the belief that their ancient rivals had been extinct for over a millennium.

The queen of Naboo journeyed to the galactic capital to protest the Trade Federation's invasion of her world.
Under the influence of the Sith, the
Trade Federation
blockaded
and occupied the planet
Naboo
in
32 BBY

[

forcing its
elected ruler
,
Queen
Padmé Amidala
, to flee to Coruscant seeking Senator Palpatine's counsel. Among the queen's retinue was
Anakin Skywalker
; a former
slave
from
Tatooine
, Skywalker was brought to the Jedi Temple by
Jedi Master
Qui-Gon Jinn
, who believed him to be the
Chosen One
destined to bring balance to
the Force
. In the Senate, Supreme Chancellor
Finis Valorum
was unable to respond to the
Invasion of Naboo
. Amidala, having learned from Palpatine about the corruption in the Republic government, called for stronger leadership by denouncing Valorum as a head of state. Consequently, Valorum was
voted out
of office and Palpatine was
elected
as the new Supreme Chancellor.
[

During the early years of Palpatine's chancellery, he brought Skywalker to the lower levels of Coruscant, revealing corruption and the Republic's limitations to the young
Jedi apprentice

The formation of the Grand Army of the Republic occurred shortly before the first battle of the Clone Wars.
The
Clone Wars
began with the
First Battle of Geonosis
in
22 BBY
,
[
3
]
when the
Separatist Crisis
that began with the establishment of the
Confederacy of Independent Systems
escalated into open war between the Republic and the Separatists. In the same year, Amidala became the target of an
assassination plot
while she was on Coruscant opposing the
Military Creation Act
. The former queen-turned-senator was saved from the
bounty hunters
Zam Wesell
and
Jango Fett
through the efforts of Kenobi and Skywalker. While Skywalker escorted Amidala to Naboo for her protection, Kenobi
tracked
Fett to the
extragalactic
world of Kamino where he discovered that an
army
of elite
soldiers
had been
bred
from Fett's
genetic template
. Kenobi followed Fett to
Geonosis
and learned that several commercial organizations pledged their resources to
Count
Dooku
and the
Separatist Droid Army
.
[

Having learned of the Separatists' plan to attack the Republic, the
Loyalist Committee
gave serious consideration to using the
Kaminoan
clone troopers
as the basis for the
Republic Military
. Though the Jedi Order had long stood as the Senate's instrument of peace in the galaxy, the limited number of Jedi Knights prevented them from fighting a galactic-scale conflict on their own.
Junior Representative
Jar Jar Binks
, acting on behalf of Naboo in Amidala's absence, proposed a motion to grant
emergency powers
to the Supreme Chancellor. The Senate voted in favor of the
Gungan
politician's request, allowing Chancellor Palpatine to unilaterally create the
Grand Army of the Republic
.
[

]
The Clone Wars saw the creation of the Coruscant Guard, an elite unit of clone shock troopers.
The Clone Wars became one of the most turbulent times in galactic history
[
18
]
and the first, full scale war in over a thousand years.
[
2
]
As the capital of the Republic, Coruscant, already a hotbed of political intrigue, became a target for both military and political reasons. Situations and events that were unthinkable centuries before became commonplace.
[
18
]
Even prior to the beginning of the war, changes could be seen in the Republic. The Senate, already corrupt and bloated found it difficult to respond, delegating emergency powers to Palpatine. The chancellor himself brought changes such as implementing the use of his personal
Red Guards
instead of the
Senate Guards
.
[
2
]
During the Clone Wars, the
Coruscant Guard
was formed to serve as a clone
security force
for the Republic capital.
[
73
]
Composed of elite
clone shock troopers
, the Coruscant Guard was led by
Clone Commander
Fox
.
[
60
]
Throughout the conflict, Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine directed the Republic war effort from Coruscant.
As the Grand Army and the
Republic Navy
spread across the galaxy to defend the Republic, the Jedi, long taking the stand of being peacekeepers instead of soldiers, led the clone
troopers
as
commanders
and
generals
. The dramatic changes were noted by the Jedi and the Republic citizens alike,
[
74
]
specifically on Coruscant.
[
75
]
Unknown to everyone except a select few, Coruscant was from where the entire war was continually manipulated by Palpatine. As Supreme Chancellor, he took overall charge of the Republic military and directed the war effort from his office in the Senate Office Building.
[
76
]
As
Darth
Sidious he directed Dooku's actions designed to continue the war and further his plans.
[
77
]
During the Clone Wars, Chancellor Palpatine had the
Zillo Beast
from
Malastare
transported to Coruscant for scientific research, overruling the objections of his Jedi advisor
Mace Windu
. Palpatine ordered the Zillo Beast's destruction, but the creature broke out of the
Republic Science and Technical Center
and proceeded on a
rampage
across Coruscant's Senate district. The clone forces on Coruscant converged on the Zillo Beast, using
poison gas
to kill it while the Jedi protected the chancellor.
[
78
]
The
Senate hostage crisis
was carried out by bounty hunter
Cad Bane
[
79
]
as part of a
Hutt Clan
plot to free
Ziro Desilijic Tiure
.
[
80
]
[
81
]
While clone troopers had already started to see open use on Coruscant at that point,
[
82
]
the failure of Senate Guards during the incident became a justification
[
83
]
for the continued
[
82
]
use of clones on the capital itself. In fact, clones came to replace
Senate Commandos
as Coruscant-based additional security and fast-action response military forces.
[
83
]
A Separatist terrorist attack disabled power to large sections of Coruscant, including its government district.
The
Confederate–Republic peace initiative
was disrupted by the
bombing
of Coruscant's
central power distribution grid
by planetside Separatist agents. Consequently, the Senate voted to
deregulate the banking industry
, allowing the Republic to take on additional loans for the purpose of purchasing more clones for its army. Unbeknown to the Senate, the attack was supported by Senators
Nix Card
and
Lott Dod
, whose respective organizations, the
InterGalactic Banking Clan
and the Trade Federation, profited from the Clone Wars.
[
72
]
During the late Clone Wars, the Jedi Temple was bombed in a terrorist attack.
Public opinion towards the end of the war, as represented by the citizens of Coruscant, began to turn against the Jedi. Protesters would gather in front of the Temple, blaming the Jedi for the military losses and the Jedi's loss of perspective as keepers of the peace. It was at that time that an
explosion
occurred at the Jedi Temple docking complex that killed six Jedi and several clone troopers and Temple employees. The investigation by
crime scene analysis droid
Russo-ISC
and Jedi Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano found that
Letta Turmond
, the
wife
of Temple employee
Jackar Bowmani
, had fed him volatile
nano-droids
which then exploded, killing Bowmani and causing the bombing at the Temple. Turmond was arrested and held at the Republic Center for Military Operations.
[
75
]
Tano was subsequently framed for the death of Turmond, who was
killed by way of the Force
.
[
26
]
She
escaped
to the lower levels of Coruscant, becoming a hunted fugitive while seeking to prove her innocence.
[
84
]
After the military
recaptured
Tano, the former Jedi was put on
trial
for
treason
against the Galactic Republic. However, the charges against her were dropped when the rogue Jedi
Barriss Offee
confessed to the crimes that Tano had been accused of.
[
85
]
Though she remained on Coruscant,
[
86
]
Tano left the Jedi Temple after deciding to not rejoin the Jedi Order.

Showdown on Coruscant
[

"
In the name of the Galactic Senate of the Republic, you're under arrest, Chancellor.
"
―Mace Windu, to Darth Sidious
[
87
]
The Battle of Coruscant erupted at the height of the Clone Wars, with Republic forces engaging the Separatists in the planet's stratosphere.
Throughout the Clone Wars, Palpatine had remained a popular leader, remaining in office at the will of the Senate for far longer than his term technically allowed.
[
87
]
During this period, Palpatine continued to consolidate and centralize his own power.
[
72
]
[
88
]
[
89
]
By
19 BBY
, the third and final year of the war,
[
3
]
Coruscant's defenses were spread thin. The Separatists had been pushed back to the
Outer Rim Territories
, and could not risk a direct strike at the heart of the Republic. Coruscanti citizens, used to having the war fought far from the capitol, were just as surprised as the
Coruscant Home Defense Fleet
when a Separatist assault force launched a surprise attack on the planet.
[
90
]
During the
Battle of Coruscant
, Chancellor Palpatine was captured and taken to the Separatist
flagship
, the
Invisible Hand
, where he was rescued by the Jedi Knights Anakin Skywalker and
Obi-Wan Kenobi
.
[
87
]
After the death of Count Dooku, the Jedi on Coruscant focused their efforts on locating General
Grievous
, the
Supreme Martial Commander of the Separatist Droid Armies
. Despite the Republic's success in the
Outer Rim Sieges
, relations were strained between the
Jedi High Council
and the Supreme Chancellor. Suspicious of the chancellor's motives, the High
Council
tasked Skywalker with
spying
on Palpatine after he had made the young Jedi Knight the
Office of the Chancellor
's representative on the Council. During the final days of the Clone Wars,
Grand Master
Yoda
and the
41st Scout Battalion
departed from Coruscant to
defend
the
Wookiee
homeworld of
Kashyyyk
. Shortly afterward, the High Council dispatched Kenobi and his
212th Attack Battalion
to
Utapau
, the planet where Grievous had been located by
Clone Intelligence
.
[
87
]
With Anakin Skywalker's help, Darth Sidious killed Mace Windu on Coruscant.
With the Clone Wars nearing its conclusion, Chancellor Palpatine revealed his secret identity as the
Dark Lord of the Sith
to Skywalker. Acting on Skywalker's report, Jedi Masters Mace Windu,
Kit Fisto
,
Saesee Tiin
, and
Agen Kolar
tried to
arrest
Sidious. The ensuing
lightsaber duel
resulted in the deaths of Kolar, Tiin, and Fisto; although Sidious was disarmed by Windu, he succeeded in killing the Jedi Order's champion due to the interference of Skywalker, who believed the chancellor's claims of possessing the power to save others from death. As a consequence, Skywalker renounced the Jedi and assumed the mantle of a Sith as Darth Vader.

The birth of the Galactic Empire was announced on Coruscant by Darth Sidious at the end of the Clone Wars.
As part of his endgame, Sidious issued
Order 66
to the entire Grand Army of the Republic,
[

using hidden
inhibitor chips
[

to force the clone troopers into killing their
Jedi Generals
.
[

On Coruscant, the
Great Jedi Purge
commenced with Vader and the
501st Legion
's
siege of the Jedi Temple
.
[
87
]
With the clone army under his control,
[
92
]
Sidious claimed the title of
Galactic Emperor
after issuing the
proclamation of the New Order
in a
special session of Congress
, declaring a new era of order and security under the first Galactic Empire. The Separatist attack on Coruscant had exposed the capital's vulnerability,
[
90
]
which, combined with Sidious' allegation of a "Jedi rebellion," compelled the Senate to support the
Emperor
and his
New Order
.
[
87

Yoda and Kenobi returned to Coruscant in the aftermath of Order 66. After learning of Skywalker's turn to the
dark side of the Force
, the two Jedi Masters resolved to destroy the Sith. Kenobi left Coruscant to find his fallen apprentice, whereas Yoda remained on the capital to confront the Emperor. However, Yoda
failed to defeat
Sidious; as a consequence, he
exiled
himself to
Dagobah
. Meanwhile, Vader was
grievously injured
on
Mustafar
by Kenobi, resulting in his
reconstruction
on Coruscant as a

Venator
-class Star Destroyers orbited Coruscant during its early days as the Imperial capital.
After Palpatine's accession to power, changes came quickly to Coruscant, formally renamed as Imperial Center, and the Galactic City to Imperial City.
[
51
]
The Jedi Temple and its surrounding serene complex became the home of the new Emperor. While the spires of the Temple remained in place, the rest of the structure was heavily remodeled and expanded with sloping facades and block-shaped additions. The entire area was known as the Federal District, with the Imperial Palace forming one point of the so-called supreme triangle.
[
31
]
As the Empire established itself in the greater galaxy, wealth and resources from across the stars were claimed and redirected towards the Core Worlds, particularly Coruscant, at great expense to those who were subjugated in order to secure that wealth.
[
53
]
The other two points on Coruscant were the byzantine COMPNOR arcology, which contained the headquarters of the Imperial Security Bureau, and the new Naval Intelligence Agency headquarters, a near-windowless complex which formerly housed the Republic's strategic center. The cityscape of Coruscant changed as well. Buildings were stripped of their elegant Republic dressings in favor of sleek lines and block-like surfaces, and many smaller buildings became engulfed into larger buildings. Some areas changed so quickly that they were not recognizable to those who had seen them only a few years before.

This place is a ghost town."
"Coruscant's changed a lot over the last few years. These days, just being outside's asking for trouble.

Jedi Knight Cal Kestis faced Imperial forces on Coruscant.
However, the Empire's policies against non-humans and its tightening control of the population caused unrest, especially among the alien populations of the underworld.
[
94
]
The Empire's way of acting caused the movement in the streets to decrease, as the planet's population tried to avoid the Imperial authorities to avoid problems, as seen on specific on
Level 2046
.
[
93
]
The wealthy, however, moved around with much less stress.
[
95
]
Indeed, Coruscanti on other levels than 2046 also moved about with impunity,
[
96
]
with such Coruscanti—even if they were not wealthy—eager to enjoy the benefits of life on Coruscant.
[
97
]
The
Krrupt Gang
kept hold of territory on
Level 3726
, where they worked to keep even the Empire away.
[

In
9 BBY
,
[

the
Stinger Mantis
crew
, led by Jedi Knight
Cal Kestis
, stole Imperial military information from Imperial Senator
Daho Sejan
on Coruscant. A large part of Kestis' team died in the
confrontation
, in addition to Sejan, who was killed by the
Inquisitor
known as the
Ninth Sister
for supposed betrayal. The Ninth Sister was also killed when Kestis decapitated her. The acquired information was handed over to the
Partisans
.
[

As the
Galactic Civil War
took shape, the Empire began moving its
Mon Calamari
population on Coruscant. The aggressiveness of the forced relocations caused
rioting
to erupt in the
Old Market Sector
, which was brutally put down by Imperial forces.
[
94
]
The Coruscant Security Force suppressed rioters on Level 3204 in the wake of Alderaan's destruction.
After the
destruction
of the planet
Alderaan
by the
Death Star
, rumors of what occurred began reaching the
Alderaanian
population on Coruscant, most of whom lived on
Level 3204
. Vigils soon became heated and angry when it became known that the Empire had destroyed the planet. For several days, rioting continued until the combined efforts of the
Coruscant Security Force
and Imperial
stormtroopers
restored order by firing indiscriminately into the crowds. The crowds, frightened, quickly dispersed. The following day, the Coruscant police arrested anyone caught out in the streets. The day after that, stormtroopers began going door to door stating that
Rebel
spies
had recruited local residents and that Alderaanians had to be taken in for questioning.

The death of Emperor Palpatine was celebrated by the citizens of Coruscant, who rebelled against Imperial rule.
In
4 ABY
,
[

]
the Rebel Alliance managed to defeat the Empire in the penultimate
Battle of Endor
. With both the Emperor and his apprentice dead, due to being killed during the destruction of the
DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station
, the citizens of Coruscant
rejoiced
, pulling down statues of Palpatine, overwhelming the stormtroopers on the streets, and setting off chimes and fireworks.
[

Police forces on speeders quickly entered the plaza and opened fire on the crowds without warning, killing many who were present. Present Coruscanti erupted into full-scale rioting. Blaster fire and fighting soon erupted across the capital between Coruscanti and the Imperial security forces.
[

Grand Vizier Mas Amedda struggled to maintain control over Coruscant as the Empire crumbled around him.
In the ensuing months the
New Republic
was formed and re-established the
Galactic Senate
on
Chandrila
.
[
101
]
Meanwhile, Coruscant dissolved into a true state of
civil war
, with some sectors entrenching themselves with Rebel resistance fighters, while other sectors actively fought against their neighbors and supported the Imperial forces. As the Empire fractured all over the galaxy,
Grand Vizier
Mas Amedda
took control of Imperial forces on Coruscant
[
59
]
and the
Coruscanti government
.
[
29
]
However, the Imperial Navy withdrew support from the
throneworld
as
Fleet Admiral
Gallius Rax
refused to allow
Grand Admiral
Rae Sloane
, the figurehead of the Navy, to send reinforcements to the planet. Rax, leader of the
Shadow Council
that secretly guided the Empire in its final days, saw the planet as representing the "decay" that caused the Empire's downfall.
[
59
]
In this vacuum, the Imperial Security Bureau was left to coordinate Coruscant's Imperial forces. Grand Vizier Mas Amedda remained the planet's administrator and de-facto head of the Empire, but held no real power. The ISB established a nominal blockade around the planet utilizing ISB spaceships and coordinated the efforts of present security forces and stormtroopers. The Verity and Federal District were heavily fortified with checkpoints and barricades. Coruscant skylanes were diverted, and ISB crafts flew on patrol. Smoke rose from damaged vehicles and buildings as a fierce guerrilla war consumed the entire planet. Amedda, in despair and desperation, sought to turn himself over to New Republic
Chancellor
Mon Mothma
and
Princess
Leia Organa
. However, they refused to take him prisoner, instead insisting that he find a way to capitulate the Empire and sign a full surrender.

Galactic Concordance

"
Mas Amedda has come out of hiding and wants to sign a cease-fire. He wants to end it. All of it.

After the Empire's capitulation, Coruscant's provisional government was established with Amedda as its figurehead.
By the time of the
Battle of Jakku
, Grand Vizier Mas Amedda was kept under house arrest by
Counselor to the Empire
Rax at the Imperial Palace. There, he was forced to make
propaganda
broadcasts and was treated like a virtual captive. Later, he was rescued by members of a child resistance group known as the
Anklebiter Brigade
, who had initially come to assassinate him. Amedda managed to persuade the child resistance fighters to help him escape so that he could end the Galactic Civil War. After emerging from hiding, Amedda contacted Chancellor Mothma to surrender. Following the signing of the
Imperial Instruments of Surrender
and the
Galactic Concordance
on Chandrila, the Empire surrendered to the New Republic
[
30
]
and ceded Coruscant over to the fledgling galactic government
[
48
]
with Mas Amedda being permitted to form a
provisional government
on Coruscant, along with Republic observers to ensure that it remained powerless under a figurehead leader. Following the Imperial surrender, weeks of celebrations took place in the streets and rooftops of Coruscant as the population celebrated the end of Imperial rule on the planet.

While no longer the focal point of legislative power, Coruscant continued to retain operations for governmental functions.
With the Galactic Civil War concluded, the New Republic sought to reshape galactic politics in an effort to both prevent the abuses of the Old Republic and bring in disaffected worlds that had seceded from the Republic prior to the Clone Wars. To accomplish this, the restored Galactic Senate decided that all worlds would have an equal say in their government, and as such all worlds had an equal chance of hosting the legislative branch on a rotating basis, rather than simply remaining on Coruscant alone.
[
48
]
The New Republic would eventually move some government operations back to Coruscant as the planet was already designed to handle and administer the galaxy's infrastructure,
[
53

transforming Coruscant into a key administrative hub
[
103
]
for the young government.
[
50

In
9 ABY
,
[
104
]
after Chandrila had taken on the capital title for a time,
[
102
]
Coruscant was named the New Republic's capital.
[
52
]
All the while, Coruscant remained a populous world, home to a trillion permanent residents, and was still referred to as "the center of the galaxy" during the New Republic Era. The
New Republic Defense Force
maintained a presence on Coruscant, providing security and structure, while overseeing the decommission of
warships
from both the
Imperial Navy
and the
Alliance Fleet
. Inoperable
Imperial
-class Star Destroyers
were disposed in
salvage yards
such as the
Shipyard Depot
on Coruscant.
[

Some Coruscanti, however, displayed a gleeful disregard for whatever politics shaped the galaxy and happily supported whatever government was in charge, displaying a lack of care for what it entailed beyond Coruscant.
[

The New Republic Amnesty Program assigned former Imperials to Coruscant where they could serve the new government.
After the Galactic Empire's defeat, captured Imperials were granted the chance to join the New Republic. As a result, programs like the
Re-Integration Institute
and the
New Republic Amnesty Program
were created to facilitate a former Imperial's assimilation into the new regime. The Amnesty Program consisted of former
Imperial officers
and
scientists
who, after spending time in the Re-Integration Institute, received accommodations in
Amnesty Housing

After joining the New Republic, Coruscant was counted among the Centrist worlds that advocated for a stronger galactic government.
Coruscant become part of a political coalition known as the
Centrists
. The faction that Coruscant was associated with lobbied for centralized rule akin to the system that defined the Old Empire. Their views were diametrically opposed to that of the
Populists
who sought to limit the galactic government's involvement in the affairs of its constituent worlds.

the planet actually fell under the control of criminal syndicates after the Empire's fall. By the time following the
Battle of Crait
[

34 ABY
,
[

]
even the respectable areas of Coruscant were roamed by gangs. Gangs fought a
bloody conflict
for control of the glittering world's districts. Tourism to the once-galactic capital all but vanished, and, for an individual to be safe, they needed to afford protection like droids and armed guards. Accordingly, the city world was not a symbol of galactic possibilities. Instead, it represented the disturbing realities of the galaxy's current time period.

Coruscant was home to a cosmopolitan society as diverse as the galaxy that it once ruled.
Although Coruscant was believed to be the homeworld of the human species,
[
28
]
the Coruscanti were as varied as the galaxy itself, especially as one journeyed below the surface of the skyscrapers and into the underworld.
[

Trillions of beings resided on the planet,

According to Qui-Gon Jinn, there were people from a thousand worlds living on Coruscant.
Th'er
, the
Priestess of Wood
from
Bri'n

[

Republic politicians resided in the more affluent upper levels of Coruscant.
As the center of galactic power, senators and delegates of every represented planet had a residence on Coruscant. From there they would spend their days either working in the Senate or hosting events such as parties and political meetings.
[

Additionally, the planet served as the home of large communities of various species, some who rarely returned to their original homeworld. Many of those communities of species that were not human resided in the lower levels of the city. With the formation of the Empire, even the humans whose home planet had fallen out of favor with the Imperial government, such as Alderaan, were forced into enclaves in the underworld.

On the surface levels of Coruscant, skyscrapers served as homes and businesses for the wealthy, powerful, and politically connected. They were ferried by private speeder or an
air taxi
from one tower to the next or to the various theaters, clubs, operas, and other entertainment areas of Coruscant.
[

]
Some journeyed to the surface street levels or Coruscant's surface parks to conduct clandestine meetings
[
82
]
or to mingle in the crowds of people that streamed through the walkways of the residential and commercial areas. Among the rich and powerful of the planet were the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic and members of the Galactic Senate.

The last generation of Republic citizens were more interested in leisure activities than galactic politics.
The influential and wealthy of Coruscant thrived in lavish lifestyles, attending meetings and social gatherings in highrise apartments,

[

dining in fine restaurants overlooking the city,
[

partying in the entertainment districts,
[

and viewing large scale shows in theaters and operas.

Even as the Republic decayed, the Clone Wars raged on, and the average citizen became disenfranchised,
[

Coruscant's wealthy continued their lifestyle.

The propaganda

On the streets of the city and in the shadows of skyscrapers teemed the planet's blue collar working population.
[

]
Many lived in the various housing blocks of the surface structures in relative comfort though not nearly as extravagant as the planet's wealthy and powerful. Many worked on the upper and lower surface levels or enjoyed the entertainment and restaurants that were more catered to their financial abilities.

The inhabitants of Coruscant's lower levels lived in impoverished conditions.
Below the housing blocks and surface levels was the population inhabiting the Coruscant underworld. A term used to describe both the thousands of levels underneath the surface, and, Coruscant's criminal population, the underworld was home to millions of the planet's population who were too poor to move upward or were hiding from the attentions of the authorities. The citizens who lived here rarely if ever during their lifetime saw the surface of the planet. Living between vast buildings and infrastructure that supported the surface, they carried on their lives at the mercy of the violence, decay, and constant threat of death.

Coruscant was the seat of the Galactic Senate, making it home to thousands of senators from across the galaxy.
Coruscant, as the center of the galaxy, thrived on the rule of government. It served as the capital of the Republic which kept the peace and prevented a major war in the galaxy for over a thousand years. Under the Republic, the Chancellor and the Senate had a direct influence on the planet's governance. Major events that affected the Republic equally affected Coruscant.

In its last years, the Republic's Senate became corrupt, bloated, and ultimately ineffectual, though some continued to fight in the belief of its ability to govern.
[
17
]
[
2
]
With the formation of the Empire, the Senate transitioned into a limited role, providing council and legislation but ultimately at the power of the Emperor.
[
87
]
As Coruscant's government services were strained, the Imperial Senate moved to have each senator open citizen assistance offices that would supplement the work of the local government. While the goal was to primarily assist the members of each senator's homeworld living on Coruscant, the assistance offices were open to help all Coruscanti.
[
36
]
After the Republic fell, Coruscant retained its status as the seat of galactic power under the Emperor's reign.
At the height of his power, Palpatine disbanded the Senate altogether and gave what little power they had left to the regional
governors
.
[
120
]
At the end of the Galactic Civil War, the New Republic installed a provisional government over Coruscant led by the former Imperial Grand Vizier Mas Amedda.
[
30
]
However, the New Republic did not establish its government on Coruscant, choosing instead to rotate the capital among the various member worlds.
[
48
]
Under the New Republic, Coruscant was represented by a senator and junior senator,
[
109

but the planet had come under the control of crime syndicates.
[
110
]
Epidemic outbreaks at the starports of Coruscant were controlled by the
Coruscant Health Office
.
[

]
Coruscant was policed by the Coruscant Security Force, which utilized police droids on the upper levels together with sentient officers and detectives,
[
25
]
and the burly underworld police who patrolled in the cutthroat environment of the lower levels.
[
114
]
The
Coruscant Ministry of Ingress
handled the flow of immigration to and from the planet,
[
7
]
and the
Galactic Republic Customs of Coruscant
office monitored cargo transports.
[

The Senate Guards were stationed on Coruscant due to their role in government security.
The Senate had its own protectors, the Senate Guard. Serving under a long tradition, the Senate Guard was a reminder that though the Republic did not have a standing army, it was not defenseless.
[
121
]
As the Clone Wars erupted, the clone troopers of the Coruscant Guard worked as peacekeepers and military police, providing a constant reminder of the expanded power of the government, specifically Palpatine.
[
122
]
With the formation of the Empire, the Coruscant Guard and Imperial stormtroopers took over the functions of the Senate Guard,
[

with stormtroopers directly responsible for security on the planet, alongside the civilian Coruscant police.

One of Coruscant's many sectors was a dilapidated industrial area known as CoCo Town.
CoCo Town
was a dilapidated industrial area of Coruscant. Home to mostly hard-working laborers, CoCo Town was located on a surface area of the city.
[
34
]
The area, however, was not as run down as other heavy industrial surface districts and contained relatively well-maintained streets, speeder lanes, and a shuttle bus route.
[
2
]
On one of the main streets built on top of the urban blocks was an eatery called Dex's Diner. Owned and operated by Dexter Jettster, a
Besalisk
with a colorful background, it served mostly hard workers from the area. The diner offered home-style cooked meals and freshly brewed
ardees
. Jettster worked as the cook and employed two waitresses,
Hermione Bagwa
and her
droid
partner,
WA-7
.
[

Shortly before the Clone Wars, Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi came to Dex's Diner to see if his old friend Jettster could identify a poisoned dart. Jettster identified it as originating from the planet Kamino, which he knew of from his days as a prospector.
[
2
]
During the civil war that erupted after the Emperor's death, CoCo Town became an epicenter of the fight between rebel and Imperial forces. The fighting saw the formation of the so-called Anklebiter Brigade, a group of youths familiar with the underground maintenance systems, who would use them to sneak behind Imperial lines and disrupt their abilities to fight.

The Grand Republic Medical Facility was a Republic Military treatment center, yet also a secret lair of the Sith.
The Grand Republic Medical Facility was a tower built to serve as a treatment center for badly injured Republic soldiers. The building was heavily guarded and had defensive shields, an independent power supply and was armored to where it could withstand a siege. The facility provided treatment to patients from all over the galaxy and boasted cutting-edge techniques in surgery and biomechanical reconstruction. The heavy fortifications and benign front appealed to Palpatine, and towards the end of the Clone Wars, he began using the lower levels of the facility to store Sith artifacts and as a meditation area, access to which was prevented by the Red Guards.

Chancellor Palpatine confronted Fives in the facility, revealing his true nature. Fives fought back against the Red Guards and escaped the facility, though he was eventually located and killed by the Coruscant Guard.
[

After ending Fives' threat to Palpatine's plans, the Medical Facility was temporarily closed, and Palpatine used the opportunity to move several larger secret
Sith artifacts
into the tower from a building in the Works. However, the medical capabilities remained operational and were used to build the life-sustaining suit for Darth Vader after his fateful duel with Obi-Wan Kenobi. The Sith artifacts inside the building fueled Vader's recovery and hate.

The Chancellor's office was located in the Senate Office Building on Coruscant.
Directly adjacent to the Senate Building was the Senate Office Building. The executive building had docking bays that wrapped around the building, allowing Senators to land their private shuttles and walk inside. The building contained mostly offices and meeting rooms for members of the Senate but also held the offices used on a day-to-day basis by the Supreme Chancellor. During Palpatine's term, the Chancellor's office was decorated with red floors and walls as well as several statues. A lobby led to the Chancellor's public office, which contained a grand desk and large window that overlooked the cityscape. To the side, another hallway led to Palpatine's inner private office.

The Senate Office Building became known as the Imperial Executive Building after the Republic's reorganization into the Galactic Empire.

The Imperial Inspectorate HQ was originally the Republic Center for Military Operations.
The Imperial Inspectorate HQ served as the
Imperial Military
headquarters of the
Inspectorate
[
127

as well as the
Naval Intelligence Agency
during the Empire's reign.
[

The facility was originally a Republic military base; constructed in close proximity to the staging areas for
Star Destroyers
, the Republic Center for Military Operations was designed by
Orson Callan Krennic
.
[
33
]
Outside of the complex was an airfield with
Venator
-class Star Destroyers
,
HAVw A6 Juggernauts
, and other ships. The
First Battle Memorial
was located in front of the base's main entrance.
[
26
]
The base was protected by shock troopers of the Coruscant Guard. Inside was a military prison, the cells had two options for entering. The first was sliding a keycard. The second was pressing a button on the outside of each cell. The cells had ray-shielded doors to make sure prisoners did not escape. Inside each cell was a bed and bowls for water and food. Another area in the prison was a medium circular room with a fairly large computer for scanning people before they entered the base, a crate for weapons and communication devices, and a red button to start the red-alert sequence.
[
26

In the latter half of the war, the prison held
Whorm Loathsom
,
Poggle the Lesser
, and
Wat Tambor
. It was also here that Ahsoka Tano escaped when she was suspected of killing Letta Turmond.
[
26

Additionally, inside the compound was a military tribunal courtroom, in which the court decided the fate of dangerous criminals. It was a tall room, with platforms extending into its center for the accused, prosecution, and defense. There was seating along its walls for the presiding official, jury, and other trial participants and onlookers.

Imperial Palace
"
The most famous of the Jedi temples, located on Coruscant, served as the home of the Jedi High Council and the vast library of data known as the Jedi Archives. When the Empire took control of the galaxy, the Temple on Coruscant became their new Imperial Palace.
"
―
Luke Skywalker
[
128

The Jedi Temple was part school, part monastery, and the home of the Jedi Order on Coruscant.
As the galactic capital, Coruscant was also home to the Jedi Order, guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy. An order of Force-sensitives, the Jedi Knights served the Republic for thousands of years as keepers of the peace. Their home was the Jedi Temple. Built on a plain of low lying urban blocks, the Jedi Temple was easily recognizable on the Coruscant cityscape with its distinctive five spires. Part school and part monastery, the Temple was the hub of all Jedi activity throughout the galaxy.
[
129
]
In one of the spires sat the Jedi High Council, led by the Grand Master of the Order, which directed the actions of the Jedi and served as advisers to the Senate and Chancellor.
[
130
]
The Temple held a large lobby and chambers with statues of famous Jedi
[
2
]
and also contained numerous facilities including hanger bays for starships and speeders utilized by the Jedi,
[
87
]
sleeping and living quarters, rooms for meetings and instruction,
[
2
]
a medical facility,
[
131
]
prison cells,
[

]
and communications and security stations.
[
87
]
The Temple also held the famous
Jedi Archives
, which stored the largest collection of information on the galaxy
[
2
]
as well as a vault containing the valuable
holocrons
containing the Order's Force knowledge and secrets.
[
77
]
The Jedi Temple fell in the first hours of Order 66, the directive that initiated the Great Jedi Purge.
During the Clone Wars, the Jedi, serving as generals and commanders of the Grand Army, coordinated their efforts from the Temple. However, as the war began to conclude, the Jedi became more separated from the hierarchy of the military command and establishment.
[
75
]
[
114
]
When Palpatine was revealed as the Sith Lord the Jedi had been searching for, he ordered the execution of Order 66 and sent his new apprentice Darth Vader to the Jedi Temple. Entering with the 501st Legion, Vader and the clone troopers seized the Temple, killing all the Jedi and younglings inside and setting the monastery ablaze. Later, Masters Yoda and Kenobi infiltrated the Temple to discover what had occurred. It was there they reconfigured a distress signal transmitting from the Temple to any surviving Jedi asking them to return (into a Sith trap), and learned the truth of Skywalker's fall and Palpatine's identity as the Dark Lord of the Sith.
[
87
]
After the Clone Wars, the Emperor had the Jedi Temple converted into the Imperial Palace.
After the war, Palpatine turned the Temple into the Imperial Palace, using it as his new home. The Temple's spires remained intact though the rest of the Temple was heavily remodeled and expanded. The hallways were stripped of all statues and Republic-era ornaments. Where they had once been quiet and solemn, they became filled with busy government workers and functionaries. A large landing courtyard allowed for shuttles and starships to land. The entire Palace complex was watched over by the red-robed Imperial Royal Guard. The center spire was converted into the Emperor's throne room with a ten-meter tall podium in the center accessible by the Emperor from his residence via a private turbolift.

The Galactic Senate Building was the political heart of the galaxy during the age of the Galactic Republic.
The Senate Building was located within the heart of the dense Federal District. Delegates would meet here during sessions of congress to discuss legislation and galactic policy. The structure's recognizable dome was two kilometers in diameter; the
Galactic Senate Chamber
could seat over a thousand senators.
[
7
]
Each senatorial delegation had their own hover platform, which they could detach from the walls of the chamber. They could then float it throughout the cavernous hall to be recognized by the Senate chair or to debate the issue at hand. In the center of the Senate chamber was the Chancellor's podium. Seated in it would be the Supreme Chancellor and the Senate's Vice Chair, who would lead sessions of congress.

The podium could be lowered to an office used by the Chancellor below the chamber.

An underworld of crime, poverty, and darkness existed beneath the upper levels of Coruscant.
Beneath the top-level structures, streets and glistening lights of the city surface was Coruscant's underworld. Its underworld was known for its crime and smugglers. It was accessible by huge portals that additionally served as ventilation shafts. The underworld was a massive city beneath a city with hundreds of
levels
built on top of each other. On each level, dwellings and smaller buildings were squeezed in between massive towers and infrastructure that serviced the upper levels. The streets and alleyways were narrow and large sections contained massive buildings and warehouses, largely abandoned. Sunlight almost never reached the lower levels, which had to be artificially lit.
[
114
]
The population was able to move from one area to another via
trains
that ran below and above the planet's surface. While airspeeders were used, they were a less common sight than on the surface levels. The underworld, containing a vast population of the poor and criminal, was dark and violent. Those who wanted to disappear to hide from the authorities or to conduct illegal transactions could blend in despite the presence of cam droids and other monitoring technology.
[
114
]
Patrolled by the underworld police division of the Coruscant Security Force, the underworld was where large populations of species not loyal to the Emperor were relocated to after the formation of the Empire. Uprisings and riots became common, with stormtroopers frequently called in to assist the Coruscant cops in putting down any dissent with ruthless violence.

Level 2046 was one of thousands of levels that made up the ecumenopolis of Coruscant.
Level 2046 was a middle level in the city. Home to a thriving community of sellers and industrialists, the sector housed dozens of shops and even a meat packing plant. Yet, there was also many impoverished citizens and desperate people who lived on this level. By the Imperial Era, the economy of the area had started to decline, even with the Empire's ruthless crackdown on crime. The increased oppression and protection racketeering from troopers hurt many of the businesses there, and corrupt politicians, such as Senator Daho Sejan, would use the level as a way of increasing the financial power. This level also featured at least one
Desi's Noodles
, a common food chain of popular fast food stores that were located in the Coruscant Underworld. Eating there was considered a must for travelers to the planet. Many stormtroopers frequented the locations for their famous dishes.

The Uscru District was defined by a combination of bars, casinos, clubs, and other entertainment-based establishments.
Further down in the lower levels of the Uscru Entertainment District was a variety of establishments, most notably the
Outlander Club
. The club was situated in a less developed area of the district and did not garner as much attention from the police, a fact that worked in the club's favor. Its labyrinth of bars, gambling rooms and sleeping quarters allowed for a wide variety of visitors and entertainment. In the center was a large bar, usually crowded, that catered to all parts of Coruscant's society.

Jedi Knights Kenobi and Skywalker pursued bounty hunter
Zam Wesell

Coruscant's industrial zone, known as The Works, was once a manufacturing powerhouse known throughout the galaxy.
A large sector and industrial area,
The Works
was once a great manufacturing district, recognized as a major source of production for
spacecraft
parts,
construction droids
, and building materials. However, centuries prior to the Clone Wars, increasingly high cost on Coruscant prompted most manufacturers to shift their operations to off-planet facilities. Afterwards, the Works mainly consisted of long-abandoned buildings and empty warehouses, many of which were appropriated by criminals, with large areas rendered uninhabitable by toxic waste. Because of this, a derelict hangar in the neglected industrial zone was the site of clandestine meetings between Darth Sidious and Darth Tyranus during the Clone Wars.
