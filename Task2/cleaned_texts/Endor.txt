View of Endor from space
A remote
moon
[
27
]
in the
Endor system
of the
Outer Rim Territories
, Endor was covered in dense woodlands, tall
mountains
, and
savannas
, and home to the
sentient
Ewok
,
Dulok
, and
Yuzzum
species
.

The semi-sentient
Gorax
[
28
]
also dwelled on the moon as well as the
Wistie
.
[
17
]
Some of Endor's
trees
reached more than 1,000
meters
in height.
[
10
]
It contained a breathable
atmosphere
to
humans
and 8% surface
water
. It also had two
suns
:
Endor I
and
Endor II
.

History
[
]
Throughout galactic history, offworld raiders occasionally came to Endor to
hunt
the
native
Ewok population to make
Ewok Jerky
, which was a popular snack across the
Outer Rim
.
[
8
]
During the
reign
of the
Galactic Empire
, the Empire, deeming Endor to be perfect for its purposes due to how remote the moon was,
[
27
]
established an outpost on the moon that included a
shield generator
complex
to protect the incomplete
second Death Star
in
orbit
of the moon.
[
23
]
The Empire
occupied
Endor.
[
29
]
In order to make way for the complex, an Ewok village was razed by Imperial
troops
, leading to strained Imperial—Ewok relations.
[
23
]
As a result of the
repulsorlift
field emitted by the
SLD-26 planetary shield generator
to keep the Death Star in a stationary orbit, Endor was prone to
earthquakes
, tidal imbalances, and other geological disturbances
[
1
]
that slowly but surely began to break up the small moon.
[
30
]
The
Tarkin Initiative
also established
Research Station 9
on the moon.
[
17
]
The Galactic Empire commenced a naval presence at Endor.
The moon was later the site of the monumental
Battle of Endor
that saw combat between the
Alliance to Restore the Republic
and its Ewok allies against
Imperial forces
who were attempting to protect the shield generator and prevent the Alliance from destroying its
superweapon
in orbit. After fierce combat on the
forest
moon, the Rebel Alliance managed not only to destroy the shield generator complex, but also the second Death Star. With the destruction of the Empire's dreaded
battle station
and the
death
of
Emperor Palpatine
and his enforcer,
Darth Vader
, the rebels and Ewoks held a victory celebration on the moon, one of many across
the galaxy
.
[
11
]
Ewoks and rebels celebrating victory on Endor.
The Rebels set up shields and
tractor beams
to protect the moon from debris from the destroyed
space station
.
[
31
]
A field of detritus settled into orbit around the moon in the
months
following the battle.
[
19
]
Additionally, the many
hyperspace anomalies
present in the
Moddell sector
absorbed the worst of the Death Star debris fallout.
[
32
]
Despite that, some debris still rained down on the moon for a
decade
after the battle, but Endor's ecosystem proved resilient.
[
33
]
At some point, the
Ewok Civil War
brought strife to Endor. The
New Republic
intervened by sending C-3PO and
Captain
Jaxxon T. Tumperakki
on a
diplomatic mission to Endor
.
[
34
]
During the
New Republic Era
, Endor remained remote and rarely-visited.
[
7
]
In
35 ABY
, following the
Battle
of
Exegol
, a
Resurgent
-class Star Destroyer
stationed above the forest moon was
destroyed
through use of the
Holdo maneuver
. The event was watched by
Wicket W. Warrick
and his son,
Pommet Warrick
.
[
26
]
Behind the scenes
[
]
Endor made its first appearance in the
1983
film
Star Wars
: Episode VI
Return of the Jedi
. The scenes of the forest moon were filmed in the giant redwood forests of northern California, in particular Tall Trees Redwood Grove and other forests near the remote town of Smith River,
[
8
]
and at soundstages in England, where the Ewok village scenes were shot.
[
29
]
During the production of the film, Endor was referred to as the "Green Moon of Endor."
[
35
]
The speeder bike chase was filmed at the Owen R. Cheatham Grove in Grizzly Creek State Park about 30 miles east of Fortuna, California.
[
36
]
Most of the other location scenes for Endor were filmed in Stout Grove, part of Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park, 5 miles east of Crescent City, California, near the Tolowa village Hiouchi. Scenes requiring explosions were shot on private logging company land in the vicinity because the trees were scheduled to be logged and the State Park would not allow damage to their trees.
