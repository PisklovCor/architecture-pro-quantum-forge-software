Description
[
]
"
Yes, I'm sure it's perfectly safe for droids.
"
―Luke Skywalker, to
R2-D2
[
4
]
The swamp-covered surface of Dagobah
Dagobah was a
planet
located in the
Sluis sector
of the
Outer Rim Territories
.
[
1
]
It was a
hot
and humid world that was a hotbed of life,
[
10
]
with the
Tash
species
[
14
]
and numerous creatures—such as
bogwings
,
dragonsnakes
,
butcherbugs
,
sleens
,
vine snakes
, and
swamp slugs
[
9
]
—living on world.
Jedi Master
Yoda
would also make a home for himself on Dagobah during his
exile
.
[
4
]
Dagobah was a mysterious, mist-shrouded,
swampy
planet
, mostly covered in
swamps and bogs
, interspersed with countless shallow lakes and lagoons and multiple
living caves
. The continental and oceanic crusts of Dagobah were only vaguely defined, and there was little in the way of
volcanic
activity or earthquakes. Examples of flora included the
lahdia plant
, the
yoghurt plant
,
gnarltree
, and
yarum seed
. The planet was devoid of any cities.
[
9
]
Among the purest locations in
the entire galaxy
within the energy field known as
the Force
,
[
18
]
it shared a mysterious
time
-related quality with such locales as
Mortis
and
Ahch-To
.
[
20
]
The
Cave of Evil
was a
vergence
aligned with the
dark side of the Force
on Dagobah.
[
21
]
The Cave was able to expand its influence across Dagobah until Yoda's arrival, which created a powerful presence in the
light side of the Force
that kept the Cave in check. As such, during the
Imperial Era
, Dagobah's ecosystem saw balance until Yoda's passing, which the Cave took advantage of to spread its darkness across Dagobah once more.
[
22
]
Dagobah had two seasons, a dry season and a wet season. During the peak of the long dry season (over half an orbit after the rains end) the uplands become too hot for most lifeforms to survive, necessitating any that live there to migrate to the lower lands. Beneath the rapidly leafing canopies of the gnarltrees that emerge from the receding green and thick waters, the once-inundated lowlands revert back to a marshy swamp once again. As the air grows more humid, the gray overcast clouds return and before another quarter orbit passes the planet is far enough away from its sun that the dry season ends and the rains return, again flooding the lowlands and covering the trees in water, making the uplands habitable once more.

History
[
]
Republic Era
[
]
"
But again, research. And in an academic paper written during
the High Republic
, I found a description of a world very strong in the Force.
"
―The Archivist
[
23
]
During the
High Republic Era
, an
academic paper
was written that described Dagobah as a world strong in the Force.
[
23
]
Yoda traveled to Dagobah in 19 BBY at the behest of Qui-Gon Jinn.
During the
Republic Era
,
Halka Four-Den
Alpha
Team
was dispatched to the
planet
Dagobah in order to chart and map the extending borders of the
Galactic Republic
and learn more about it flora and fauna. After three
months
, Four-Den and her Alpha Team were overwhelmed by diseases, dangerous wildlife, and fast-growing
plants
. No trace of the team was discovered.
[
7
]
Near the end of the
Clone Wars
,
Jedi
Grand Master
Yoda
traveled to the planet Dagobah after hearing the voice of deceased
Jedi Master
Qui-Gon Jinn
. He ventured into the
swamp
, where he communed with Jinn, who appeared manifested as a group of fireflies. He told Yoda of how to communicate with the living after death through the connection between the Living Force and the Cosmic Force. Then, Yoda entered a cave, where he saw a vision of the Jedi fighting the
clones
and then the mysterious
Sith Lord
.

Imperial Era
[
]
Yoda's exile
[
]
"
Into exile I must go. Failed, I have.
"
―Yoda, to Bail Organa
[
24
]
Yoda lived the planet Dagobah for the rest of his life.
After his failure to defeat the
Sith Lord
Darth Sidious
following the
formation
of the
Galactic Empire
, Yoda
exiled
himself
[
24
]
to Dagobah.
[
4
]
Using an
E3-standard starship lifeboat
, began his exile where he continued his studies of the Force. The lifeboat served as Yoda's initial shelter but it started to degrade within a year due to Dagobah's
swampy
environment. As the first shelter was slowly consumed by the swamp, Yoda built a new
home
for himself.
[
25
]
He positioned it near to the dark side cave but out of range of its influence and would visit every few years.
[
26
]
However, the Dagobah wet season created a need for the Jedi Master to regularly relocate to the planet's highlands for the duration.
[
27
]
At some point, former
Sava
Madelin Sun
arrived on Dagobah in search of Yoda. After saving her from a
monster
, Yoda used the Force to lead Sun into the dark cave. While inside, she saw visions which dissuaded her from looking for him. She then left the planet as Yoda watched from afar.
[
23
]
Training ground of Luke Skywalker
[
]
"
You will go to the Dagobah system. There you will learn from Yoda, the Jedi Master who instructed me.
"
―Obi-Wan Kenobi, to Luke Skywalker
[
4
]
Traveling to Dagobah, Skywalker sought out Grand Master Yoda in order to complete his Jedi training.
Years
later,
Luke Skywalker
of the
Alliance to Restore the Republic
traveled to Dagobah under the direction of late
Jedi Master
Obi-Wan Kenobi
in hopes of finding Yoda and being trained in the ways of the
Jedi Order
. Arriving with his astromech
R2-D2
, Skywalker crashed into a bog upon landing and happened upon the Jedi, though he was unaware it was, in fact, Yoda at the time. The old master took Skywalker back to his
hut
for dinner, where he revealed his true identity to Skywalker. Initially reluctant to train Skywalker due to his age and lack of patience, Yoda was eventually convinced to teach him by the
Force spirit
of Kenobi.
[
4
]
One night during Skywalker's training, an Imperial
probe droid
from
Project Swarm
arrived on planet. The droid's operator,
Maela
, initially believed there was no reason to look further into the planet during the unit's patrol until she spotted
[
28
]
Skywalker's X-wing in the swamp.
[
4
]
Although she realized the outline of what she saw resembled an X-wing, she had realized the cruelty of the Empire after witnessing the aftermath of the
Battle of Hoth
, so she deleted the footage before moving on to her next droid.
[
28
]
During his training, Skywalker entered the
Cave of Evil
and
confronted
a vision of
Darth Vader
, who he struck down, only to see his own face in Vader's
mask
. Later, Skywalker ended his training early, however, once he sensed his friends
Han Solo
and
Leia Organa
were in danger. Although Yoda and Kenobi attempted to reason with Skywalker to stay, the student left the planet, promising to return and finish his training.
[
4
]
He would keep his word, and after learning Vader was his father during their
duel on Cloud City
, saving Leia and Chewbacca from Vader on
Cloud City
, and rescuing Solo from
Jabba the Hutt
on
Tatooine
, he would return to Dagobah to complete his Jedi training. Upon arriving, he found Yoda sick and dying, who told him that his training was complete, but all he had to do was confront Vader one last time, and the old master became
one with the Force
. The ghost of Kenobi then revealed to Skywalker the truth that Leia was, in fact, a Skywalker and Luke's sister before Luke left the planet to confront Vader and the Emperor in hopes of turning Vader back to the
light side
.
[
29
]
The Cave of Evil, meanwhile, took advantage of Yoda's death to once again spread its power across Dagobah.
[
22
]
New Republic Era
[
]
"
The cave is power. And darkness. And you will enter.
"
"
What's in there?
"
"
Only what you've been too weak to bury.
"
―Snoke and Kylo Ren
[
30
]
Ren dueling the vision of Skywalker.
Sometime after the
skirmish on the Minemoon
,
Kylo Ren
, nephew of Luke Skywalker, along with his master and
Supreme Leader
of the
First Order
,
Snoke
, came to Dagobah in order to face Ren's darkest fears. In the Cave of Evil, he experienced a vision of his uncle Luke, whom he dueled and killed, and a vision of his parents Leia and Han. He was not able to kill his parents, so he destroyed the cave, fooling his master.
[
30
]
By
34 ABY
,
[
31
]
herbs from Dagobah had made their way to
Oga's Cantina
on
Batuu
, where they became a popular ingredient in the so-called
Dagobah Slug Slinger
alcoholic beverage.
[
14
]
During or after 34 ABY,
[
32
]
the
freighter
Millennium Falcon
landed on Dagobah. There, the
Wookiee
crewmember
Chewbacca
attempted to take some time to himself to rest aboard the ship, only for the droids
BB-8
and R2-D2
[
33
]
—the very same droid who had accompanied Luke Skywalker to Dagobah
[
4
]
—discovered a
Kowakian monkey-lizard
aboard the ship.
[
33
]
Inhabitants
[
]
Dagobah was the homeworld of the Tash species, who grew herbs.
[
14
]
Jedi Grand Master Yoda made his way to Dagobah and adopted it
[
27
]
as his homeworld during the Imperial Era.
[
4
]
Another being of sorts on Dagobah was the so-called Cave of Evil, a living Force vergence
[
26
]
strong in the dark side,
[
4
]
but confined to its place on the planet.
[
26
]
Behind the scenes
[
]
"
A small escape pod hurls toward the swamp planet and disappears in the mist. The pod has landed, and YODA descends the ramp, surveying the unfamiliar terrain.
"
―Description of Dagobah's deleted scene from Episode III
[
34
]
Dagobah first appeared in the
1980
film
Star Wars
: Episode V
The Empire Strikes Back
, the second installment of the
Star Wars
original trilogy
.
[
4
]
Slated to appear in one scene of the
2005
film,
Star Wars
: Episode III
Revenge of the Sith
, the planet was cut from the final film, leaving it for the DVD release. The scene featured how Yoda started his exile.
George Lucas
removed the scene so that the film would not have "too many endings," despite producer
Rick McCallum
's wishes.
In the
2016
reference book
Star Wars: Complete Locations
, an image of Dagobah was mistakenly used in the planet profile of
Kashyyyk
. The book also alleges that no civilization existed on Dagobah,
[
9
]
but
Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge
later recanonized the Tash species.
[
14
]
The
Kwazel Maw
seen in the
Star Wars: The Clone Wars
episode "
Bombad Jedi
" was based off of an unused design by
Ralph McQuarrie
for a
swamp
slug
creature on Dagobah.
[
35
]
There is a long-running fan debate about how long Luke Skywalker trained on Dagobah.
[
36
]
This debate was jokingly referenced in "The Lost Boy," a story told by
Vaneé
, when Ben Solo asked if Skywalker trained for 20
minutes
on Dagobah.
[
37
]
Lucas' vision for Dagobah started out as a swampy and misty planet that would be similar to the setting of the Sherlock Holmes novel
The Hound of the Baskervilles
, which was in Dartmoor, England.
