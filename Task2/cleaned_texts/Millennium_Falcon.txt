Meetyl's Misery
,
Wayward Son
, and

, was a
Corellian
YT-1300 light freighter
built around
60 BBY
. Earning a legendary status under their ownership, the ship was most famously used by the
smugglers
Han Solo
and
Chewbacca
before, during, and following the
Galactic Civil War
.
During the
Falcon
'
s time in the possession of the smuggler
Lando Calrissian
, it accumulated numerous modifications in the name of convenience and luxury, including painted exterior paneling and a large
escape pod
. However, during Han Solo's famous record-breaking
Kessel Run
, in which he piloted the freighter for the first time, many of these additions were destroyed or lost, leaving the ship battered by the time Solo won it from Calrissian shortly afterwards in a game of
sabacc
. Its aged appearance still belied numerous advanced modifications to boost the ship's speed, weapons, and
shields
, including a
hyperdrive
engine among the fastest in
the entire galaxy
, enabling it to outrun
Imperial Star Destroyers
. It also included sensor-proof smuggling compartments, which were used during the
rescue
of
Princess
Leia Organa
in
0 BBY
to evade
Imperial
stormtroopers
. Afterwards, the
Millennium Falcon
saw further action when Solo chose to join the
Rebel Alliance
during the
Battle of Yavin
, where it was able to sneak up and fire on
Darth Vader's
TIE Advanced
, allowing
Luke Skywalker
to fire the
proton torpedoes
from
his
T-65B
X-wing starfighter
that destroyed the
Death Star
.
After Solo was
captured
on
Bespin
, Calrissian took command of the
Falcon
once more to search for him. In
4 ABY
, following Solo's
rescue
, Calrissian flew the ship at the
Battle of Endor
, where it entered the
DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station
and aided in its destruction from within. Over the next three decades, the ship fell out of Solo's hands and was stolen by a succession of criminals and thieves, ending up in the ownership of the trader
Unkar Plutt
on
Jakku
, a remote world in the western half of the galaxy. The
Falcon
was eventually stolen by the
Force-sensitive
scavenger
Rey
, former
First Order stormtrooper
Finn
, and
Resistance
droid
BB-8
to escape the forces of the
First Order
in
34 ABY
. Shortly thereafter, it was reunited with Solo and Chewbacca.
Following Solo's
death
soon after, the
Millennium Falcon
became a Resistance vessel piloted by its new owner, Rey, throughout much of the
First Order-Resistance War
. In
35 ABY
, the ship was once again captained by Calrissian during the
Battle of Exegol
, which saw a decisive victory for the Resistance and
Jedi Order
, before being returned to Rey, who had been newly dubbed a
Skywalker
.

Schematics of the
Millennium Falcon
The
Millennium Falcon
was a
YT-1300 light freighter
of the YT-1300f variety.
[
1
]
Its basic shape was defined by two convex saucers welded together, a pair of front-facing mandibles and an outrigger-style, side-mounted
cockpit
with
transparisteel
viewports
. Apart from the shape of its chassis, the
Falcon
retained very little of its off-the-dock instrumentation. Because its successive owners either upgraded or downgraded every system according to their personal specifications, the freighter ended up becoming a unique
ship
.
[
12
]
These customizations, however, came at the price of reliability, and the
Falcon
was known to suffer frequent breakdowns in the heat of battle. After the circular military-grade
sensor dish
was lost during the Battle of
Endor
, the dish was replaced with the base rectangular model which was originally supplied with the ship. During the
Battle of Crait
, the
Falcon
again lost its rectenna, and it was replaced with a military-grade rectenna similar to that of the one lost during the Battle of Endor. Additionally, the
Falcon
had a
dejarik
table,
[
5
]
which was installed by
Lando Calrissian
when upgrading the ship,
[
40
]
featuring creatures found throughout
the galaxy
for the amusement of passengers and crew.

The
Millennium Falcon
'
s
Girodyne
SRB42
sublight engines
were heavily modified through the addition of a
SLAM
overdrive that rerouted energy for acceleration bursts. As a result, the ship could fly at a maximum speed of 1,200
kilometer per hour
in
atmosphere
and 3,000

in
space

The stock
hyperdrive
of the YT-1300 series was replaced with a
Isu-Sim
SSP05
.
[
1
]
Although the regular SSP05 was a Class 1 hyperdrive, the one that equipped the
Falcon
had been jury-rigged "
Vandangante style
" into a Class 0.5 drive
[
12
]
—twice as fast as most
warships
of the
Galactic Empire
.
[
11
]
According to
Ralsius Paldora
, the
Millennium Falcon
'
s hyperdrive failed 1.22 times more than the one on the
YT-2400 light freighter
.
[
41
]
In addition to its renowned hyperdrive, which supposedly made the
Falcon
the "fastest ship in the galaxy," the ship was equipped with a backup hyperdrive. It was much slower than the primary engine and often took several weeks or months to reach the nearest star system.
[

]
A component of the engines was the
engine coupling
which caused the
Falcon
to malfunction when misaligned.

Whoa, two ST2 launchers? What the hell were you and Solo doing with my ship that made you install that much firepower?
"
―Lando Calrissian, to Chewbacca
[

The
Falcon
'
s forward mandibles housed the forward deflector shields, concussion missile launchers, and beam lamps.
The weaponry of the
Millennium Falcon
was normally suited for a much larger warship.
[
1
]
It included two CEC
AG-2G
quad laser cannons
(one ventral and one dorsal) with enhanced
laser
actuators and
gas
feeds, which gave them maximum range and damage. These served as its primary defensive armament, able to destroy enemy fighters with a single direct hit. Between the forward mandibles, there were two
Arakyd
ST2 concussion missile tubes
, each of which carried a four-
missile
magazine.
[
12
]
Additionally, a
BlasTech
Ax-108 "Ground Buzzer" blaster cannon
mounted near the ventral boarding ramp allowed its crew to defend the ship against infantry and other light targets while on the ground.

[

The ship had three
deflector shield
generators
: the bow was protected from both lasers and
concussion missiles
by
Torplex
and
Nordoxicon
units, while a
Kuat Drive Yards
generator shielded the stern.
[
12
]
The
Falcon
'
s combination of sublight speed and maneuverability was comparable to most of the
starfighters
fielded by the
Rebellion
and Empire, while its shielding, hyperdrive, heavy armor and weapons were on par with those typically found on capital ships. These traits made it an ideal choice for
General
Lando Calrissian's attack run within the bowels of the
Death Star
during the
Battle of Endor
. While agile and almost near impervious to almost all heavy weapons and turbolasers as any large warship, the
Falcon
'
s only real combat weakness was its sheer size in comparison to starfighters. Although the ship had squeezed through many narrow spots in its history, it still lost the oversized
sensor dish
while trying to get through a particularly tight section of the
Death
Star
's superstructure and a few replacement ones in subsequent battles.

Its main
computer
was made of three
droid brains
which identified themselves as the

The first droid brain was a
transport droid
known as
V5-T
, the second from a
slicer droid
called
ED-4
,
[

and the third from
L3-37
, which began as an
R3-series astromech droid
brain, but was overlaid with data architecture from an espionage droid, protocol droid processors, and custom state-of-the-art coding.

A pair of

In case of emergency landing or crash on
water
, the
Falcon
was also equipped with
flotation pontoons
.
[

The
Falcon
also had a
static charge dissipator
which could dissipate static charge on the ship, but when the dissipator burned out, the
Falcon
would need immediate repairs.

The YT-1300f
light freighter
[

designated unit YT 492727ZED was built at
Orbital Assembly Facility 7
,
[
46
]
a Corellian
shipyard
owned by the
Corellian Engineering Corporation
, more than 90
years
before the
Battle of Starkiller Base
.
[
2
]
As was intended, the ship began its career as an intermodal tug pushing container in
orbital
freight yards.
[
1
]
It once worked in the galaxy's busiest
spacelanes
.
[
9
]
Just after the
Battle of Coruscant
, it was docking in the
Senate Office Building
.
[
47
]
Inconsistent records from the
Bureau of Ships and Services
indicate that the YT 492727ZED changed ownership more than once via unregistered transactions.
[
2
]
During the
Clone Wars
, the freighter was property of the
Republic Group
. The YT 492727ZED was registered by the Republic Group on the planet
Ralltiir
as the
Stellar Envoy
. At some point, either prior or during its ownership under the Republic Group, a military-grade rectenna was installed on the
Stellar Envoy
. Shortly after the end of the Clone Wars, the
Stellar Envoy
was involved in a collision with a bulk freighter and was seriously damaged. The wreckage was reconditioned by a
salvager
, who used several sections and modules from a scrapped YT-1300p freighter to repair the ship.
[
2
]
The ship had a number of owners over its service.
[
48
]
At some point, the
human
gambler
named Lando Calrissian won the YT 492727ZED in a game of
sabacc
, and registered the freighter under the name
Millennium Falcon
.
[
2
]
Calrissian modified the freighter, inside and out,
[
12
]
converting it into his own speedy sports vessel as Calrissian saw how powerful its freight-pushing engines were. As such, Calrissian modified the two cargo mandibles at the front into an auxiliary ship launch, thus turning the plain freighter into a unique starship.
[
9
]
He also once explained the controls to
Brea Tonnika
of the
Tonnika sisters
.
[
49
]
Lando Calrissian made significant modifications and named the vessel
Millennium Falcon
.
When Calrissian was injured during a
raid
on
Kessel
, the
smuggler
Han Solo
and
Wookiee
Chewbacca
were left in command of the ship. During the escape from Kessel, Calrissian uploaded L3 to the
Falcon
as the ship's
navigational system
, assisting the crew in making the
Kessel Run
in under 12
parsecs
. During the Kessel run the ship was majorly damaged by
TIE fighters
, with one blasting a hole in the front of the
Falcon
. After destroying the fighters, Han slid the
Falcon
over an asteroid which destroyed two of the
Falcon's
landing gears. In order to escape the
Summa-verminoth
in
The Maw
, Han launched the escape pod. The ship also lost its
sensor dish
upon being caught in the Maw. Calrissian later took the heavily damaged ship after landing on
Savareen
, but ended up betting his ship in a "
Corellian Spike
" game of sabacc on
Numidian Prime
,
[
13
]
losing to the smuggler Han Solo.
[
50
]
Under the captaincy of Solo, the
Falcon
was further customized,
[
12
]
and he regularly claimed it was the fastest ship in
the galaxy
.
[
49
]
While most who saw the ship declared it looked like "junk," Solo and Chewbacca both prided themselves on the
Falcon
, considering it the epitome of classic design.

The
Millennium Falcon
blasts its way out of Mos Eisley
The
Millennium Falcon
'
s destiny as a tool for a small-
time
smuggling operation was changed when it was chartered by
Obi-Wan Kenobi
and
Luke Skywalker
in
Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina
for passage to
Alderaan
. When challenged by Kenobi about his ship's speed, Solo bragged that the
Falcon
was capable of attaining 0.5 past
lightspeed
, and that it had completed the infamous Kessel Run in fewer than twelve parsecs.
[
21
]
The journey to Alderaan proved to be much more than a simple passenger flight. The
Falcon
was forced to blast its way out of
Mos Eisley
when a
garrison
of
stormtroopers
attacked the ship in an attempt to recover its cargo. It also narrowly avoided capture by a couple of
Star Destroyers
before making the jump to lightspeed.
[
21
]
Having also been on Tatooine, the Tonnika sisters had hoped to steal the
Falcon
to use as their own ship. When the
Falcon
began its escape, it created a big enough distraction that the siblings realized they had the chance to steal any other nearby ship,
[
49
]
while seeing the freighter escape the Empire's grasp convinced stormtrooper
TD-7556
to desert the
Imperial Army
.
[
52
]
The
Falcon
emerged from
hyperspace
into the
remains of Alderaan
. After chasing a single
TIE fighter
stranded in what appeared to be empty space, the
Falcon
was captured by one of the
first Death Star's
tractor beams
and secured aboard the massive
space station
. Thanks to quick thinking by those aboard the
Falcon
, the ship was made to appear as if the crew had escaped soon after taking off from
Tatooine
. It was searched by stormtroopers and it was reported that there were no passengers on board and the
escape pods
had been jettisoned. Their search had missed the crew, who were hidden in a series of secret
smuggling holds
. They then killed a
scanning crew
before they could be detected by the scanner.

The

escapes from the soon-to-explode Death Star after helping Luke Skywalker make his final shot.
In a matter of
hours
, the
Millennium Falcon
had once again escaped the
Imperial Navy
, this time with the
rescued
Princess
Leia Organa
on board. After a fleeing battle with Imperial fighters and a trip through hyperspace, the ship arrived at the secret
Alliance base
on
Yavin 4
. During the ship's stay on the
battle station
, the Empire had planted a
homing device
on board the
Falcon
, which it used to pursue Organa to this location. As the Rebels scrambled to organize a preemptive
attack
on the massive Death Star, Solo loaded his reward on board the
Falcon
and departed the
moon
. However, thanks to Chewbacca, its smuggler
captain
had a change of
heart
. Solo and his ship returned just in time to cover Skywalker in his last-ditch effort to destroy the station and secure the safety of the Rebel Alliance. The ship's surprise attack destroyed
Darth Vader's
two
wingmen
and sent Vader himself spinning off into space, allowing Skywalker to successfully complete his attack and destroy the Death Star.

The

The battered hull of the
Falcon
became a symbol of the rebel cause as it flew against the Empire, becoming a bane to the regime. Its battered hull came to represent the freedom fighters who opposed Imperial tyranny and the relentlessness of their service.

Escape from Hoth
[
]
"
Punch it!
"
―Han Solo to Chewbacca
[
4
]
Three years after the Battle of
Yavin
, the
Falcon
was undergoing repairs in the main
hangar
of the Rebel installation
Echo Base
as the Empire began its
assault
on
Hoth
, assisted by
Treadwell
, a
WED 15 "Septoid 2" Treadwell toolkit droid
who was in service of the ship at the time. As the Alliance scrambled to escape the base, Solo and Chewbacca hurried to make the ship spaceworthy. Organa was cut off from her
transport
by a tunnel
cave
-in and was forced to make her escape from Hoth on board the
Falcon
accompanied by Solo, Chewbacca, and
C-3PO
. Solo used the ship's uncanny maneuverability and his
piloting
skills to elude an Imperial
Star Destroyer
chasing them, and two more emerging from hyperspace. Solo's maneuvers in the
Falcon
caused the two Star Destroyers approaching and the one pursuing to nearly collide with each other. The
Falcon
then attempted to make the jump into lightspeed, but was stopped short by an equipment malfunction.
[
4
]
Forced to take drastic measures to avoid capture, Solo made the decision to pilot the
Falcon
into a nearby
asteroid field
in an attempt to lose the Imperial pursuers. However, his repairs were cut short as he had unknowingly landed inside an
exogorth
. Escaping just in time as the beast's huge mouth was closing, the
Falcon
was discovered by the
Imperial II
-class Star Destroyer
Avenger
. They attempted to jump to lightspeed, but once again, the hyperdrive was not fully repaired. Solo then had Chewbacca change course and fly directly at
Avenger
'
s bridge in an apparent suicidal attack run. The ship disappeared from sight and became undetectable to
Avenger
. It had not gone far: Solo had attached the
Falcon
to a blind spot on the conning tower of the Star Destroyer. Adhering to standard Imperial procedure, the Star Destroyers of
Death Squadron
ejected all scrap and garbage before entering hyperspace. Solo then signaled Chewbacca to release the ship's landing claws, allowing the
Falcon
to "float away with the rest of the garbage."
Boba Fett
, however, saw through this ruse, and waited behind in
Slave I
, following the
Falcon
as it left the
system
.
[

The
Falcon
is pursued as it flees Cloud City.
After its close encounter with the Empire, the
Falcon
journeyed to
Bespin
's
Cloud City
, where Solo's old acquaintance Calrissian held the position of
Baron Administrator
. The Empire had arrived first, however, due to Fett tailing the
Falcon
to Bespin. The crew of the
Falcon
were captured,
tortured
, and detained, and Solo was encased in
carbonite
and given to the
bounty hunter
. Treadwell was destroyed by Imperial forces to prevent him from warning the remaining crew that the recently-repaired hyperdrive had been disabled by Vader's men. The remaining members of the crew, joined by Calrissian,
escaped
to the
Falcon
. After rescuing Skywalker, who was dangling from a
weather vane
on the underside of Cloud City, the ship left the
planet
and attempted to jump to lightspeed, and only a last-
minute
patch by
R2-D2
prevented the
Falcon
from falling into Imperial hands. Thanks to R2's efforts, the hyperdrive was activated and the
Falcon
managed to make the jump at the last
second
and escape.

"
But this isn't your ship. With Han gone, I'm commandeering it for the Rebel fleet, which means you don't get a say in where it goes.
"
―Leia Organa, to Lando Calrissian
[
43

After the events on Cloud City, Organa, Skywalker, Calrissian, Chewbacca, C-3PO, and R2-D2 all were in the
[
43
]
main hold,
[
2
]
although Skywalker sat thinking about what had happened, as he learned that Vader was actually his father. Chewbacca and Calrissian were discussing Solo, with the latter questioning what they would have done if the
Falcon
had caught up with
Slave I
, noting that firing Fett's ship out of the sky would have killed Solo. Calrissian also spoke to Organa and told her that they missed their chance to catch Fett because she made them get Skywalker, whom Organa introduced as the man who destroyed the Death Star. Calrissian promised that they would rescue Solo, as both he and Chewbacca understood Fett was taking their friend to Jabba. When Skywalker joined the conversation and asked where Solo was, Organa told him about what happened and promised that they would find him. After she asked what had happened to him, Skywalker only told her that Kenobi had not answered his call.

The
Falcon
makes an attack run against the light cruiser
Organa had R2-D2 give Chewbacca coordinates for the Rebel fleet, and, with Solo gone and Calrissian not being the ship's owner, she commandeered the
Falcon
for the Alliance. However, when they arrived at
Rendezvous Point Delta-Three
, the gathered Alliance ships were
under attack
from the Empire. Upon seeing the
Falcon
, the Imperial
commander
,
Ellian Zahra
, ordered a
TIE fighter squadron
and all non-essential
turbolaser
batteries to target the freighter. Aboard the ship, Organa and Skywalker, despite his missing hand, moved to the gunning stations, while Chewbacca and Calrissian served as the pilots. Skywalker, however, began to be distracted by thinking about Kenobi and Vader, but he then used the Force on the TIEs, ripping the controls from the pilots' hands, allowing them to deviate from their course and collide with each other, giving Organa a chance to blast them. Calrissian and Chewbacca then made their attack run on an
Arquitens
-class command cruiser
and, using the
Falcon
'
s
missiles
, destroyed the ship's gun emplacements, making an opening for the Rebels to escape to
backup Rendezvous Point Gamma-Nine
.
[

After the battle, Zahra explained to Vader that the
Falcon
had disrupted their attack. She told the
Dark Lord of the Sith
that they attempted to destroy the vessel, but Vader informed her that the
Falcon
was off-limits. He permitted her to kill Organa if she was able to, as he had no use for her, but Vader explained to her that there was someone else who was often aboard the
Falcon
. He warned Zahra that if this individual, who was secretly his son Skywalker, was killed, there would be significant consequences.

Rescuing Han
[
]
During the following
months
, Organa, Skywalker, and Calrissian continued to use the
Falcon
on missions.
[

]
After they
successfully rescued Han
, the
Falcon
rendezvoused with the Alliance Fleet and prepared to assault the newest Death Star.

Look, I want you to take her. I mean it, take her! You need all the help you can get; she's the fastest ship in the fleet!

The
Falcon
leads the starfighter attack during the Battle of Endor.
During the Battle of Endor, Calrissian and
Sullustan
copilot
Nien Nunb
flew the
Falcon
as
Gold Leader
. After the
planetary shield
protecting the second Death Star was brought down by Solo's strike team, the
Falcon
and several Alliance fighters entered the battle station through a conduit port and sped toward the
reactor
core. Space was limited in the conduit tunnels leading to the core, and the relatively large
Falcon
lost its
sensor
dish when the ship clipped a conduit in the tunnel. Calrissian was able to pilot the craft into the energy core housing the main reactor, fired upon the reactor prompting its collapse, and headed for the exhaust port. The
Falcon
barely outran the massive explosion that destroyed the powerful battle station. Soon afterwards, the Imperial fleet retreated, and the galaxy celebrated the death of
Emperor
Palpatine
.
[

New Republic
[
]
Several months later, Solo and Chewbacca traveled through space on the
Millennium Falcon
. After receiving intelligence from
Imra
that the Empire had reduced their presence on the Wookiee
homeworld
of
Kashyyyk
due to the advances of the
New Republic
, Solo and Chewie traveled to
Warrin Station
to rally smugglers and Wookiee exiles for a
campaign
to liberate Kashyyyk.
[
31
]
Around this time, Han Solo replaced the
Falcon's
sensor dish with a rectangular civilian model.
[
27
]
However, this information turned out to be a trap set by the Empire. Chewie was captured, but Solo managed to escape on the
Falcon
. A
year later
, Solo corresponded with his
wife
Organa via
hologram
on the edge of
Wild Space
. During the conversation, the
Falcon
came under attack, and communication was lost with Organa. In response, Organa dispatched the New Republic
starfighter pilot
Norra Wexley
to rescue her husband. Norra was joined by her son,
Temmin Wexley
, the
B1-series battle droid
Mister Bones
, the former Imperial
Sinjir Rath Velus
, the
Zabrak
bounty hunter
Jas Emari
, and the
New Republic Special Forces
soldier
Jom Barell
.
[
27
]
The
Millennium Falcon
after the Battle of Endor
Norra and her team found Solo and the
Falcon
on the planet
Irudiru
. After interrogating the
Siniteen
prison
builder
Golas Aram
, Solo and his allies traveled on the
Falcon
and Emari's ship
Halo
to the
Kashyyyk system
. They bluffed their way through the Imperial
blockade
by posing as a repair crew working at
Ashmead's Lock
, an automated prison on the far side of Kashyyyk. There, they managed to free Chewbacca and a hundred other prisoners including Norra's husband
Brentin Lore Wexley
. Norra, Temmin, and the prisoners except Chewbacca then used the
Falcon
to travel back to the New Republic
capital
of
Chandrila
.
[
27
]
After learning that the Wookiee uprising was underway and that the Empire was
orbitally bombarding
Kashyyyk, Organa convinced the
Alderaanian
pilot
Evaan Verlaine
to fly her on the
Millennium Falcon
into the Kashyyyk system to aid her husband and Chewie. Later, she contacted the New Republic Captain
Wedge Antilles
and convinced him to send his
Phantom Squadron
there.
[
27
]
During the brief space skirmish, Organa and Verlaine flew circles around the Imperial Star Destroyers. After the Imperials capitulated, Organa landed the
Falcon
in the hangar of the Star Destroyer
Dominion
, which her husband had captured. Organa used the ship's
laser cannons
to blast several stormtroopers who were still putting up a fight. After reuniting with her husband, Organa and Solo took the
Falcon
to Kashyyyk. There, they parted company with Chewbacca before returning to Chandrila.
[
27
]
Prior to the
Battle of Jakku
, Temmin tried to convince Solo to lend him the
Millennium Falcon
so that he could travel to
Jakku
to rescue his
mother
Norra, who was
hunting
for the Imperial fugitive
Grand Admiral
Rae Sloane
. After some haggling, Solo and Organa relented. Temmin and Velus attempted to depart on the
Falcon
, but were prevented from leaving Chandrila by
Senate Guards
. While Temmin and Velus initially believed that Solo had double-crossed them, they later learnt that
Senator
Tolwar Wartol
, a political opponent of
Chancellor
Mon Mothma
, was the true culprit and had been
spying
on Solo and Organa's conversations. The
Millennium Falcon
later saw action during an
operation
on
Nakadia
to rescue the
slicer
Conder Kyl
and
Nim Tar's child
.

The

Overall, the
Millennium Falcon
had become a legend in and of itself under Solo and Chewbacca.
[
48
]
In
31 ABY
[
56
]
Solo traveled to
Maz Kanata
's
castle
on
Takodana
to speak with Kanata. While the pair were conversing, a
Nikto
named
Gannis Ducain
offered to co-pilot for Solo after overhearing that Chewbacca was with his family and that Solo was short-handed for a job. After accepting Ducain's offer, he and Solo went to
Christophsis
, where Ducain stole the
Falcon
.
[
57
]
It was later stolen by
Toursant Irving
and
Vanver Irving
—also known as the
Irving Boys
—before finally ending up in the possession of
junk boss
Unkar Plutt
on
Jakku
.
[
58
]
At some point he had it stored at
Niima Outpost
. The collector
Karr Nuq Sin
traveled to Jakku in his quest to learn about the
Jedi Order
, and he and his friend
Maize Raynshi
boarded the ship. Nuq Sin had a vision of Skywalker and Kenobi training aboard it after touching the remote.
[
59
]
In Plutt's possession, it would sit unused for years in Niima Outpost. Plutt paid for minimum maintenance for the ship with the intention of preparing it fully for flight only in the event that he would actually find a buyer.

"
You tell him Han Solo just stole back the

Han Solo and Chewbacca once again take ownership of the
Falcon
.
In
34 ABY
,
Rey
,
Finn
, and
BB-8
stole the vessel to
escape
an attack from the
First Order
on the outpost. While in spaceflight, the
Falcon
was picked up by Solo and Chewbacca's sensors, and they promptly locked down the
Falcon
'
s systems so they could recapture it using a freighter called the
Eravana
they were then using for their smuggling operations, which they later abandoned after a cargo of
rathtars
that were onboard escaped. Upon boarding their old vessel, Solo and Chewie went about inspecting their ship and found Rey and Finn hiding, whom they assumed were the
thieves
that had stolen the
Falcon
. When Rey and Finn explained that they were going to take BB-8 to the
Resistance
, as he had a
map
that would reveal Skywalker's location, Solo and Chewie agreed to help them. Solo was impressed with how much Rey knew about the ship itself, and how it worked.
[
5
]
On the way to Maz Kanata's castle, when the
Falcon
began to malfunction, the mechanically savvy Rey, who was sitting in the cockpit to the right of Solo, made a modification to the ship by simply bypassing a faulty
compressor
. Later, the
Falcon
'
s crew arrived at Takodana and met
Maz Kanata
.

The Resistance

"
Blow that piece of junk out of the sky!!

Kylo Ren
[

]
The
Millennium Falcon
departing Takodana
Following the
attack
on Kanata's castle,
Starkiller Base
prepared to fire on
D'Qar
. After learning of this, the Resistance devised a plan to sneak onto the surface and lower the planetary shields so their fighters could
attack
the superweapon's weak spot. Using the
Falcon
, Solo, Chewbacca, and Finn infiltrated the base, lowered the shields, and reunited with Rey, who had been captured on Takodana by the First Order.
[
5
]
While the
Millennium Falcon
laid dormant, it was briefly spotted by members of the Resistance's
J-Squadron
who were flying a stolen
TIE silencer
into the planet. At least two of its members speculated on whether it could be the
Millennium Falcon
that they'd heard so many stories about, but at the time they could not confirm whether it was.
[
60
]
After the confrontation with
Kylo Ren
following the death of his own father, Han Solo, Chewbacca rescued Finn and Rey aboard the
Falcon
, managing to escape the planet as it exploded. After learning of Skywalker's location, Rey, Artoo, and Chewbacca flew in the
Falcon
to
Ahch-To
, the remote planet where he had gone into self-
exile
.
[
5
]
Chewbacca and R2 remained with the
Falcon
while Rey attempted to persuade Skywalker to join the Resistance, though Luke slipped aboard the old freighter to reminisce, and was reminded of what was at stake when Artoo replayed the hologram Leia Organa recorded to recruit Obi-Wan Kenobi on her
secret mission to Tatooine
some thirty-four years earlier.
[
28
]
The
Falcon
led the First Order TIEs away from Resistance forces.
Rey later departed the island, believing herself capable of restoring Ben Solo to the
light side of the Force
, and used one of the freighter's
escape pods
to reach the
Supremacy
while Chewbacca piloted the
Falcon
to
Crait
. After
Snoke
's death, Rey returned to the
Falcon
using Snoke's escape vessel, and the YT-1300 participated in the
Battle of Crait
. Piloted by Chewie with the dorsal turret manned by Rey, the
Falcon
led TIE fighters away from the Resistance
V-4X-D ski speeders
attempting to destroy the First Order's
superlaser siege cannon
. The freighter lost its radar dish and its lower quad cannon during a chase through Crait's subterranean caverns. The
Falcon
was later used to evacuate surviving Resistance personnel from the
Crait outpost
while Luke Skywalker bought his allies time by confronting Kylo Ren.
[
28
]
After the battle, Rey spent a lot of time walking the corridors of the
Falcon
, thinking about how much history it had.
[
46
]
Stationed on Batuu
[
]
"
Now, there are plenty of Corellian freighters in the galaxy. But only
one
has made the Kessel Run in twelve parsecs! Only
one
has destroyed the mighty
Death Star!
And only one was captained by the legendary Han Solo! That ship is the
Millennium Falcon
, and it belongs to me.
"
―Hondo Ohnaka
[
61
]
The
Falcon
on
Batuu
.
As it had been against the Empire, the
Falcon
became a bane to the First Order and a flying symbol of relentless resistance to tyranny.
[
51
]
The
Millennium Falcon
landed on
Batuu
, where
Hondo Ohnaka
made a deal with
Chewbacca
and hired a temporary crew for the ship to take part in one of Ohnaka's endeavors.
[
62
]
Immediate repairs
[
]
Rey, Finn, BB-8, and Chewbacca were transporting the
Togruta
smuggler
Moebin Faltus
on the
Falcon
when the ship started to experience problems. Rey believed that the engine coupling had a slight misalignment, but upon further investigation she discovered the static charge dissipator had completely burned out. She decided that the
Falcon
would have to make an immediate pit stop on the planet
Choss
to look for a new dissipator with Faltus, while Finn and Chewie repaired the freighter.
[
42
]
End of the war
[
]
At some point, the
Falcon
had a new circular
Rectenna
dish, installed after it lost its rectangular one at the Battle of Crait, and a new lower quad laser cannon. Following
Palpatine's broadcast
, Finn,
Poe Dameron
, Chewbacca, R2-D2, and
Klaud
arrived at the Sinta Glacier Colony to meet a Resistance informant, the
Ovissian
Boolio
, ordering them to relay a message to Leia from a spy within the First Order. Several squadrons of
Special Forces TIE fighters
and
TIE whisper fighters
later arrived at the colony, preparing to destroy the
Falcon
. As Finn prepared for the action and entered the gunner cockpit, Boolio jested that a worthy thanks for the information provided would be to win the war. Forced to travel into the depths of the colony by a wall of TIEs, the
Falcon
destroyed a number of its pursuers before jumping to
hyperspace
through one of the colony's walls. The remaining fighters pursued the
Falcon
regardless, with Dameron beginning to
lightspeed skip
through a number of systems, whose dangers the First Order pilots were unable to evade.
[
30
]
Dameron's boldness allowed him to outmaneuver the enemy, though his reckless trick-flying heavily damaged the
Falcon
, causing multiple fires both within and outside of the ship. Upon returning to the
Resistance base
on
Ajan Kloss
,
Rey
berated a fatigued Dameron for this, though he rebuffed her by noting that his favored droid
BB-8
was in similarly poor condition due to her earlier training accident. Rey dismissed the pilot, quipping that he was a difficult man, before hugging Finn, who jokingly joined her in condemning his companion. Although Rey was further angered by the revelation that Dameron lightspeed skipped with the
Falcon
, a maneuver that the aging freighter could not support, Dameron admitted the true cause of his concern: Rey was "the best fighter [the Resistance had]," but she had spent her time training and furthering her knowledge of the Force rather than participating in the war against the First Order.
[
30
]
After learning that Darth Sidious had returned, and that the
Final Order
, a massive fleet of
Xyston
-class Star Destroyers
built by the
Sith Eternal
, was on Exegol, Rey learned from Luke Skywalker's notes that a
Sith wayfinder
could lead them there. Leia revealed that an ally on Pasaana may be able to help. Rey, Finn, Poe, Chewbacca, BB-8, and C-3PO departed in the
Millennium Falcon
as it underwent repairs.
[
30
]
The First Order later captured the
Falcon
, Chewbacca, and the
dagger
; attempting to save Chewbacca, Rey accidentally destroyed a First Order transport with Force lightning. Presuming that Chewbacca has been killed, the group escaped on
Ochi
's ship, the
Bestoon Legacy
. The
Falcon
was later carried by a group of TIE fighters to the
Resurgent
-class Star Destroyer
Steadfast
.
[
30
]
Poe suggested traveling to the planet Kijimi to have the Sith text extracted from C-3PO's memory. Although the process would wipe the droid's memory, the coordinates to the
wayfinder
would be revealed. The
Steadfast
later arrived on Kijimi, with Rey sensing that Chewbacca was, in fact, still alive and that the
Falcon
was onboard the Star Destroyer. The group then mounted a rescue mission.
[
30
]
As Rey searched for the
dagger
to get more clues, the group later rescued Chewbacca, but managed to get themselves captured. General Hux was then revealed to be the First Order spy, having leaked information to the Resistance in order to bring about the downfall of Kylo Ren's rule.
[
30
]
Ren later arrived and initiated a
Force bond
with Rey, in which he revealed that she was Sidious' granddaughter, with her father being the son of the Emperor. Kylo once again asked Rey to join him, but she refused and escaped in the
Falcon
.
[
30
]
Having discerned the location of the Sith wayfinder, the group traveled to
Kef Bir
, a moon within the
Endor system
. Kylo Ren later arrived on Kef Bir, destroyed the
Emperor's wayfinder
and dueled with the scavenger. Dying, Leia called to Kylo through the Force, distracting him long enough for Rey to seize the opportunity to impale him with
his own
lightsaber
. Sensing Leia's death and feeling pity for the injured Ren, Rey healed the conflicted
Supreme Leader
and eventually took his ship in order to exile herself on
Ahch-To
.
[
30
]
The group, save for Rey, returned to base. The Resistance then followed Rey's coordinates to Exegol, as she traveled to confront her destiny and Sidious, at the behest of the
Force spirit
Luke Skywalker
, by flying
his old
T-65B
X-wing starfighter
there. Lando and Chewbacca sought to gather allies of the Resistance for the
final battle
against the
Sith
, traveled to the core worlds.
[
30
]
The
Millennium Falcon
lead the Citizens' Fleet into the Sith Eternal's fleet, the Final Order.
The
Falcon
later arrived at Exegol, leading the
Citizens' Fleet
comprised of many Resistance ships from systems all across the galaxy, against the extensive
forces
of the Sith Eternal. Finn and the Kef Bir native
Jannah
led an assault onboard the hull of the
Steadfast
, the command ship of the battle. They successfully destroyed the command bridge and prevented the Sith fleet from leaving Exegol. As the
Steadfast
was about to crash, the
Falcon
promptly rescued Finn and Jannah. The Resistance then destroyed the remaining Sith forces.
[
30
]
With the Final Order fleet destroyed by the combined forces of the Exegol strike team and the galaxy fleet, Rey and the Resistance emerged victorious and left Exegol to return to Ajan Kloss. Rey, accompanied by BB-8, later took the
Falcon
to
Tatooine
, to visit Luke Skywalker's
old, abandoned home
. She then buried
Anakin's
and
Leia's lightsabers
beneath the sands of the homestead, having built
her own
.

Behind the scenes
[
]
The
Millennium Falcon
first appeared in
Star Wars
: Episode IV
A New Hope
, the first installment of the
Star Wars
original trilogy
. In the scenes with Lando Calrissian and Nien Nunb in the
Falcon
in
Star Wars
: Episode VI
Return of the Jedi
, the set of the ship was rocked to stimulate the
Falcon's
flight.
[

Unused concept art of the
Millennium Falcon
with cargo pods for
Star Wars: The Force Awakens: Incredible Cross-Sections
It was speculated that the
Millennium Falcon
would make an appearance in
Star Wars
: Episode III
Revenge of the Sith
to further tie the
prequel trilogy
to the
original trilogy
, and the ship did indeed make a cameo in the movie. At the beginning of one shot closing in on a docking bay on
Coruscant
, a YT-1300 freighter is seen flying in to dock.
George Lucas
confirmed that it was the
Millennium Falcon
and not just another ship of the same class.

For the
Star Wars
Anthology
film
Solo: A Star Wars Story
, the interior
Falcon
sets were the same ones used in
Star Wars
: Episode VII

and
Star Wars
: Episode VIII
The Last Jedi
, although they were redressed. These sets were augmented with the addition of extra sets depicting Lando Calrissian's quarters and cape closet.

'
s serial number
For
Star Wars: The Force Awakens: Incredible Cross-Sections
, the author
Jason Fry
intended for the book to include information about the freighter series being able to act as a cargo pusher, but was unable to get the image in time.
[
66
]
This information was later added to the
YT-1300 Millennium Falcon Owners' Workshop Manual
.
In
Episode IV
, the
Millennium Falcon
had only three landing gear legs, but five landing gear legs in
Episode V
.
Solo
fixes this by revealing the
Millennium Falcon
had five landing gear legs, but two were lost during the Kessel Run.

Aftermath: Empire's End
↑
"Flight of the Falcon, Part 5: Grand Theft Falcon" takes place after the events of "
The Crimson Corsair and the Lost Treasure of Count Dooku
," as
Kix
is indirectly mentioned, but before
Life Day
1
, which
Star Wars: Timelines
dates to c.
31 ABY
. "The Crimson Corsair and the Lost Treasure of Count Dooku" refers to the prologue as taking place 50
years
prior to the main story. The prologue takes place in between "
The Wrong Jedi
" and
Star Wars
: Episode III
Revenge of the Sith
, both of which are placed in
19 ABY
by
Star Wars: Galactic Atlas
. Therefore the prologue takes place in 19
BBY
, and the main story takes place around 31 ABY. Therefore, "Flight of the Falcon, Part 5: Grand Theft Falcon" also takes place around 31 ABY.
