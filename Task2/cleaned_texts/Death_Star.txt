Constructions modules were used during the construction of the Death Star.
The DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station,
[
5
]
also known as the DS-1 Orbital Battle Station,
[
10
]
was a
superweapon
that was originally designed by the
Geonosians
during the waning
years
of the
Galactic Republic
. The
project
was later taken over by the
Galactic Empire
;
[
2
]
however, the
plans
for the battle station were
stolen
from
Scarif
by the
Rebel Alliance
,
[
9
]
which led to the weapon's destruction at the
Battle of Yavin
, but not before it unleashed its planet-destroying cannon on the
Imperial security complex
on Scarif,
[
9
]
Jedha City
on
Jedha
,
[
2
]
and
annihilated
the entire planet of
Alderaan
.
[
7
]
The name "Death Star" was coined by the
scientists
who found themselves working on the project, such as
Galen Walton Erso
.
[
9
]
The name was adopted by the Empire at large, with
Major
Lio Partagaz
of the
Imperial Security Bureau
considering it "a prescient turn of phrase."

DS-2 Battle Station

DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station

The data brought to us by the Bothan spies pinpoints the exact location of the Emperor's new battle station.

The Second Death Star orbiting Endor.
After the destruction of the first Death Star, the DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station was the second and final Death Star constructed by the Galactic Empire and was designed to be more powerful than the original. During the
Battle of Endor
, the Death Star II's energy shield was destroyed and the Rebels used the unfinished superstructure of the battle station against it, destroying the weapon as they had its predecessor.
[

Behind the scenes
[
]
Inspiration of other franchises
[
]
The idea of the Death Stars and empowering players to be able to tell stories with similar engines of death and levels of sci-fi gravitas and drama was an inspiration for the now-massive novel and wargame franchise Warhammer 40,000 as noted at the start of the first rule book for the first edition.
[
12
]
Mimas
[
]
That's no space station; it's a moon.
Mimas
, the smallest and the innermost of seven major moons orbiting the planet
Saturn
, is notable for a single enormous impact crater called
Herschel
. The appearance of Mimas and Herschel in pictures taken during the space probe
Voyager I's
1980
flyby of the Saturn system showed a similarity to the first Death Star, with Herschel appearing as the superlaser disc, as remarked in the scientific press.
[
13
]
This resemblance became one of Mimas's most notable characteristics in astronomy and popular culture.
[
14
]
During the
Cassini
orbiter's
visit to the Saturn system in
2004
, the resemblance was noted again in the official press releases
[
15
]
and by the scientific press.
[
16
]
However,
Cassini
'
s more recent images of Mimas do not all resemble a Death Star orbiting Saturn, as the moon is more egg-shaped then the battlestation.
[
17
]
White House petition
[
]
In late 2012, a petition was submitted to the White House website urging that the United States government build a real Death Star as a economic stimulus and a means to ensure people got back to work again, and wanted its completion by 2016 at the earliest. The petition gained more then 25,000 signatures, ensuring that an official response be supplied. In early 2013, the proposal was rejected (in a tongue-and-cheek manner), citing that the overall cost of the Death Star's construction would amount to a cost exceeding $852 quadrillion, and would take 833,000 years before it could even be ready for construction due to the rate of steel production. Another reason for the rejection was also because the Government "did not support blowing up planets."
[
18
]
As such, the
Star Wars Blog
, in response to it, created a light-hearted, in universe reply from the
Galactic Empire's Public Relations department
were the Empire, with official statements from Admiral Conan Antonio Motti and Governor Wilhuff Tarkin, shrugged off the criticisms by the planet Earth's leaders regarding the design of the battlestation. In addition, in the same source, it also denounced the planet for grossly overestimating the cost of designing the Death Star, as well as commenting the overall lack of production methods of the planet in comparison of the Galactic Empire, even implying that the planet's leaders were cowardly in their decision.
