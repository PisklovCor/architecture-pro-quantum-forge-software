"
Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.
"
"
But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.
"
"
That's 'cause a droid don't pull people's arms out of their sockets when they lose. Wookiees are known to do that.
"
"
I see your point, sir. I suggest a new strategy, Artoo. Let the Wookiee win.

Wookiees
, known in their own language of
Shyriiwook
as "
the People of the Trees
," were a
species
of tall,
hairy
humanoids
that were native to the
planet
Kashyyyk
. A notable member of this species was the warrior
Chewbacca
,
Han Solo
's best friend and co-
pilot
, who played a vital role in the
Clone Wars
during the
Battle of Kashyyyk
, the
Galactic Civil War
by aiding the
Rebel Alliance
in their fight against the
Galactic Empire
, and the
war
against the
First Order
. They were quite strong, and were known to rip people's arms out of their sockets when provoked. Though being from a temperate planet known for its
swamps
and
forests
, Wookiees were perfectly comfortable on icy worlds like
Ilum
and
Hoth
, not requiring any additional protective
clothing
, i.e.
gloves
or
boots
.

"
Big. Covered in fur. Strong.
"
―
Beru Whitesun Lars
describes a Wookiee
[

]
Gungi, a Wookiee youngling in the Jedi Order
Wookiees were a tall
species
of furry humanoids from the
planet
Kashyyyk
, who could grow to a height of nearly three
meters
.
[
10
]
They were covered from head to toe in a thick, shaggy coat of
hair
with
water
-shedding properties
[
1
]
that notably came in
shades
of brown,
[
4
]
black,
[
5
]
gray, and white. The species had two
sexes
, female
[
6
]
and male. The latter grew long beards in adult life.
[
11
]
The average male weighed 150
kilograms
while the average female weighed 100 kilograms.
[
1
]
The Wookiees'
eye
color
ranged from blue
[
4
]
to brown.
[
7
]
Wookiees were big eaters, with the average adult requiring 3,500-6,000 calories a
day
of
food
.
[
12
]
Their
diet
consisted of wild
plants
,
berries
,
meat
, and spices. They preferred their spices to be hot.
[
1
]
While Wookiees did not like eating
blosphi extract
, it provided them with enough nutrition to survive.
[
13
]
The "
Wookiee flu
" was a sickness that affected Wookiees. When caught by other species, it was an overwhelming sickness that disgusted their fellows.
[
14
]
The literary collective term for Wookiees was a grove of Wookiees.
[
15
]
Many of their kind were known to understand Galactic Basic but were unable to speak it due to their species' vocal structure.
[
16
]
Wookiee anatomy diagram
Wookiees had extendable claws which they used for climbing; using them for anything else violated the
Wookiee honor code
.
[
17
]
Despite their fearsome appearance and volatile temperament, Wookiees were regarded as intelligent, sophisticated, loyal and trusting. When angered, Wookiees were known to descend into a berserker rage.
[
10
]
Wookiees had an average lifespan of 400
standard years
,
[
1
]
and they appeared not to age over a span of fifty
years
.
[
18
]
Their lifespans dramatically decreased due to the harsh working conditions in the
spice
mines
of
Kessel
.
[
19
]
During their prime growing years, Wookiees were often hungry, forcing them to eat whenever they could.
[
20
]
One Wookiee,
Lohgarra
, lived healthily for
centuries
—the only distinction being her white fur.
[
6
]
They could learn to understand other
languages
, like
Galactic Basic Standard
, but they were physically unable to speak them
[
21
]
due to their strange vocal chords that prevented them from speaking verbal languages.
[
1
]
To those who had not learned to understand
Shyriiwook
, the Wookiee language,
[
21
]
it appeared they spoke in a series of growls and purrs. Although a rare phenomenon,
Force-sensitive
Wookiees were possible, and some joined the ranks of the
Jedi
, becoming a source of great pride for their people.
[
22
]
Such Wookiees included the
Jedi Master
Kelnacca
,
[
23
]
Jedi Master
Arkoff
,
[
24
]
Jedi Knight
Burryaga Agaburry
,
[

History
[
]
The Clone Wars
[
]
Wookiee warriors defended their homeworld against Separatist invaders.
"
Go, I will. Good relations with the Wookiees, I have.
"
―Jedi Master Yoda
[
26
]
Wookiees originated on the
Mid Rim
forest
planet of Kashyyyk. In the ancient past, they invented and crafted weapons that fired poisoned darts and arrows.
[
19
]
During the
Clone Wars
and the reign of
King
Grakchawwaa
,
[
27
]
the Wookiees remained fiercely loyal to the
Galactic Republic
and fought alongside them in several
star systems
.
[
11
]
Towards the end of the conflict, Wookiee forces also defended their
homeworld
from a
Separatist
invasion
with the help of Galactic Republic
forces
led by
Jedi Master
Yoda
, who had good relations with them.
[
26
]
Age of the Empire
[
]
"
Kashyyyk, l-look, things are really bad down there. The - the Empire's muscling in on those Wookiees big time.
"
―Greez Dritus talking about the Empire's exploitation of Wookiees
[
28
]
At the end of the Clone Wars, numerous Wookiees were slaughtered by the
clone troopers
they allied with in the ensuing chaos of the anti-Jedi
Order 66
,
[
26
]
and soon after the
establishment
of the
Galactic Empire
, their homeworld of Kashyyyk was
blockaded
by the Empire. The softening and repeal of anti-
slavery
laws ultimately led to the Empire classifying the Wookiees as non-sentient.
[
29
]
The Empire enslaved the Wookiees not because they were a meaningful threat to the Empire but because their massive, robust physiology allowed them to work long and hard in extreme conditions.
[
30
]
A pair of Wookiees rush into battle wielding
ryyk blades
As a result, many Wookiees were enslaved and made to build much of the Imperial war machine,
[
30
]
sent to be worked to
death
in the dangerous
spice mines
of the planet
Kessel
,
[
11
]
or on construction sites such as the
Death Star
, though a number escaped this fate.
[
31
]
Numerous Wookiees were bred for use in medical experimentation, and some were used as playthings for
Grand Moff
Lozen Tolruck
, Imperial governor of Kashyyyk, who occasionally hunted live Wookiees for sport.
[
30
]
To keep them in line, all of the Wookiees on Kashyyyk were fitted with
inhibitor chips
that caused them great pain if activated. The Empire also quickly learned the most efficient way of preventing any wide-scale uprisings was by threatening clan and family members, particularly the younglings. Normally, a Wookiee would quite willingly rip a stormtrooper limb from limb regardless of their own safety, but could not bear to see other Wookiees subjected to the agony instead.
[
30
]
Despite these grave circumstances for their race, the Wookiees nonetheless found ways to help others. In the early days of the Empire, the Outer Rim planet of
Lasan
, home to the
Lasat
, was brutally sacked and devastated by the Empire for daring to question the new regime. Unable to stand by and watch, many Wookiees went to Lasan and fought the Empire with weapons forged from the
wroshyr
trees of their homeworld, in many cases giving their own lives to save the Lasats. Because of their actions, a few Lasats (including
Garazeb Orrelios
) were able to escape the genocide and survive in the wider galaxy.
Surviving Jedi Cal Kestis helped the Partisans free Wookiees from an Imperial refinery.
In
14 BBY
, Wookiees who were being held prisoner by the Empire and forced to work at an Imperial refinery in Kashyyyk, were freed by the
Partisans
led by
Saw Gerrera
and the Jedi Padawan
Cal Kestis
, who joined them during the attack on the refinery. Kestis went to Kashyyyk in search of
Tarfful
, a Wookiee chieftain he believed might have information that could be useful in his
mission
to rebuild the
Jedi Order
. Kestis left the world while the Partisans searched for Tarfful and returned when he was informed they had found him. Tarfful told Kestis to search the top of the
Origin Tree
, where he figured out where to go.
[

]
Enslaved Wookiees forced to work in the spice mines of Kessel
During the
Age of the Empire
, the-then
Commodore
Thrawn
and
Lieutenant Commander
Eli Vanto
discovered evidence that the Empire was transporting enslaved Wookiees after responding to a distress transmission from the troop transport
Sempre
. The Wookiee slaves were
liberated
by a task force consisting of the frigate
Castilus
and two squadrons of
V-19 Torrent starfighters
, which then
attacked
the space station
Lansend Twenty-Six
, where more Wookiee slaves were held. Thrawn commanded the operation to reinforce Baklek Base and forced the insurgents to surrender. When Vanto objected to slavery, Thrawn tried to rationalize the Empire's enslavement of Wookiees.
[
32
]
About fourteen years after the establishment of the Empire,
[
11
]
the
212th Attack Battalion
led by
General
Kahdah
quelled a Wookiee
revolt
on Kashyyyk. Civilian travel to the planet was restricted and access was granted only for official government business.
[
33
]
Shortly later, the Empire
transported
several captives including
Wullffwarro
and his son
Kitwarr
to the
spice
mines
of Kessel. The
Spectres
, a rebel cell based on the
Outer Rim
world of Lothal,
rescued
the
prisoners
and escaped Kessel.

"
Would somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way?
"
―Princess Leia referring to Chewbacca

Wookiees were known for their tenacity in battle.
During the
Galactic Civil War
, several Wookiees, including
Chewbacca
[
4
]
and
Lohgarra
, fought for the
Alliance to Restore the Republic
[
6
]
and its successor government, the
New Republic
.
[
31
]
One year
following the
Battle of Endor
, the Wookiee homeworld had become an Imperial remnant known as
Imperial territory G5-623
led by Grand Moff Tolruck. Kashyyyk was later
liberated
by the
New Republic forces
. Working with a group of rebels led by
Han Solo
and Chewbacca, the former Imperial loyalty officer
Sinjir Rath Velus
, used a hyperspace transceiver to neutralize Tolruck's inhibitor chips. This enabled the Wookiees to rise up en-masse against the Imperial occupiers and take their well-earned revenge, with Grand Moff Tolruck himself being killed by his personal slave,
Cracktooth
. The Imperial forces attempted to orbital bombard Kashyyyk but were defeated by a New Republic fleet led by
Leia Organa
and
Admiral
Ackbar
.
[
30
]
Wookiee and New Republic forces then conducted mopping-up operations against the remaining Imperial holdouts on Kashyyyk. During one of these skirmishes, Chewbacca reunited with his son,
Lumpawaroo
, who had escaped from a slave labor camp run by
Commandant
Dessard
.

Black Krrsantan, a Wookiee bounty hunter active during the New Republic era
New Republic era
[
]
During the
New Republic era
, Kashyyyk's forests including the Black Forest grew back. Many Wookiees including Chewbacca and Chief
Karasshki
lived in villages. About
two years
after the
Battle of Jakku
, the rogue
Pau'an
surgeon
Fyzen Gor
began kidnapping and killing Wookiee
younglings
to use as spare parts for his
droid
followers, the
Original Dozen
. Due to his shadowy appearance, he earned the nickname the "Long Man." Chewbacca agreed to help
Han Solo
and
Lando Calrissian
retrieve the
Phylanx Redux Transmitter
in return recovering the limbs of the murdered Wookiees for funeral rites.

Society and culture
[
]
"
A Wookiee! Rare you are to the Jedi. Proud, your people must be.
"
―Professor
Huyang
to Gungi
[
22
]
Wookiee buildings blended with their environment.
The name for their species was known to translate
[
16
]
from Shyriiwook into
Galactic Basic Standard
[
37
]
literally as "the People of the Trees".
[
16
]
Living in a great harmony with the nature of Kashyyyk,
[
38
]
the Wookiees placed great value upon the wroshyr trees of their home planet; they considered the mighty trees the true owners of the land, themselves merely coexisting with them, and would consult them before every battle by bowing their heads against their wood to listen to their wisdom.
[
39
]
Wookiees were expert craftsmen who blended off-world technology like
blasters
and
lightsabers
with traditional materials such as
wood
, precious
stones
, and
metals
.
[
1
]
Most Wookiees carried
bowcasters
as weaponry, which were handcrafted.
[
19
]
Chewbacca's bowcaster
broke Wookiee tradition due to its automatic cocking system. Wookiees believed that seeing a
can-cell
brought good luck, and Wookiees often kept them as pets.
[
1
]
The Wookiee people by and large hated
Trandoshans
, great
hunters
[
40
]
who turned their talents against the Wookiees and hunted them.
[
41
]
The highest way a Wookiee could compliment someone was to groom them.
[
6
]
Wookiees were not known to be subtle.
[
42
]
In Wookiee society, loyalty and courage were valued as sacrosanct tenets.
[
10
]
It was typical for Wookiees to value honor and friendship above all else.
[
19
]
It was considerably rare to find Wookiees with criminal tendencies.
[
43
]
When male Wookiees turned 12 years old, they would undergo initiation rituals to enter adulthood. Wookiees spoke three
languages
:
Shyriiwook
,
Thykarann
, and
Xaczik
.
[
1
]
Shyriiwook had 150 words for "wood"
[
19
]
but no word for "
artist
" because Wookiees viewed their carving skills as a survival skill and not a talent.
[
44
]
Wookiees in the galaxy
[
]
"
Wookiees stand out in a crowd.
"
―Lando Calrissian
[
45
]
Chewbacca and Han Solo were famous smugglers-turned-Rebel heroes.
Notable Wookiees included Chewbacca, the
navigator
and long-time companion of Han Solo.
[
18
]
Other noteworthy Wookiees included the
chief
and general
Tarfful
(who fought alongside Master Yoda during the Battle of Kashyyyk),
[
26
]
the warrior Wullffwarro, and his son Kitwarr.
[
34
]
Force-sensitive Wookiees included the Jedi Master Arkoff,
[
24
]
Jedi Master
Kelnacca
, and Jedi Padawan Burryaga Agaburry, all of whom lived in the
High Republic Era
,
[
20
]
as well as the Jedi
youngling
Gungi, who lived during the Clone Wars.
[
22
]
During the Age of the Empire,
Krrsantan
was a Wookiee who worked as a
bounty hunter
for both
Jabba
the
Hutt
and
Darth Vader
.
[
5
]
The first
Wookiee
Leia Organa ever met was a guest at one of
Senator
Bail Prestor Organa
's state dinners, with the Wookiee leaving an impression on the young Leia.
[
46
]
Drokkatta
was a Wookiee who served in the
Coruscant rebel cell
.
[
47
]
The Wookiee
Greybok
played an important role in turning the tide of the
Battle on Sevarcos
by freeing several
rancors
, which rampaged the Imperial lines.
[
31
]
He later took part in Han Solo and Chewbacca's campaign to liberate Kashyyyk.
[
30
]
While serving as a
senator
in the New Republic's
Galactic Senate
, Leia Organa once saw two Wookiee commuters in front of her on an
automated sidewalk
at the
New Republic senatorial complex
on
Hosnian Prime
.
[
48
]
Behind the scenes
[
]
The word "Wookiee" originated in
George Lucas
's first movie,
THX 1138
, in a line ad-libbed by actor
Terry McGovern
: "I think I just ran over a Wookiee."
[
49
]
A Wookiee later appeared through Chewbacca in the first
Star Wars
film.
[
4
]
In the
rough draft
of the script for
A New Hope
, Wookiees (spelt "Wookees") inhabit
Yavin
and fly some of the starfighters in the
Battle of Yavin
.
[
50
]
According to
Much to Learn You Still Have: 8 Things You Might Not Know About Wookiees
on
StarWars.com
(
backup link
)
, in early drafts of the script for
Star Wars
: Episode VI
Return of the Jedi
, the
second Death Star
was to be built in
orbit
around Kashyyyk and the construction would be done by Wookiee laborers,
[
44
]
but
Star Wars: The Annotated Screenplays
and
The Making of Return of the Jedi
contradict this, instead saying that
Ewoks
and the
forest moon of Endor
were present in
George Lucas
's earliest notes and scripts for
Return of the Jedi
while Kashyyyk and Wookiees other than Chewbacca were never present.
[
50
]
[
51
]
The Wookiees also appeared in the non-canon
LEGO Star Wars: The Freemaker Adventures
episode "
Peril on Kashyyyk
," which premiered on
Disney XD
on
June 27
,
2016
. In the episode, the scavenging
Freemakers
family helps Chief
Attiburra
rescue his son
Tantarra
from a Trandoshan island fortress.
