Hoth
was a remote, icy
planet
that was the sixth planet in the
star system
of the
same name
, located in the
Anoat sector
of
the galaxy
's
Outer Rim Territories
. It was the
homeworld
to the primitive
wampa
species
.
It notably hosted
Echo Base
during the
Galactic Civil War
, the temporary headquarters of the
Alliance to Restore the Republic
, until the
Galactic Empire
located them, initiating a major confrontation known as the
Battle of Hoth
. In the months following,
scavengers
established temporary base camps on the planet to scrap the
AT-ATs
destroyed.
In the
months
after the
Battle of Endor
, rumors emerged about the
New Republic
intending to repurpose Hoth into a
prison
for those who remained loyal to the Empire, however, the credibility of the rumors were dismissed as
Chancellor
Mon Mothma
had been dedicated to a pretext of justice over punishment. Meanwhile, the war returned to Hoth, where it became the site of another
battle
during the
Iron Blockade
.

Description
[
]
"
Anyone who looks at Hoth from above would be forgiven for thinking it a mostly dead ball of ice.
"
―Kell Tolkani's notes
[
25
]
Imperial AT-ATs traverse the frozen landscape on Hoth.
From
space
, the
planet
of Hoth looked like a pale blue orb due to its dense snow and ice covering. Five planets existed between Hoth and its
sun
, while an
asteroid belt
surrounded the planet with meteors occasionally striking the surface.
[
7
]
Most of its surface was covered with glaciers and frozen ice plains.
[
5
]
Despite the characterization of Hoth as being a planet of frozen tundras
[
26
]
and nothing more, a characterization the naturalist
Kell Tolkani
said would be fair if someone only viewed the world from orbit,
[
25
]
another third of the planet was covered by oceans.
[
27
]
The
temperature
, although always frigid, was known to drop to -60°C come nightfall.
[
7
]
Although devoid of intelligent life, Hoth was home to fifteen sub
species
of
tauntauns
, which were commonly used by Rebels as a means of transport, and which
Han Solo
cut open to use as shelter to keep
Luke Skywalker
and himself warm during a snowstorm. It was also home to a species of towering predators known as
wampas
.
[
10
]
[
7
]
During his stay on Hoth, Skywalker was captured by a
wampa
and was hung upside down in the wampa's cave, waiting to be eaten. Using the
power
of
the Force
, Skywalker managed to get his hands on his
lightsaber
and cut himself down from the roof and sever the wampa's right arm. The planet also had a number of "crystalline geysers."

History
[
]
The Rebel Alliance
[
]
"
Jan Dodonna was always planning for the future…he had preliminary scans for possible new rebel bases.
"
"
Gimme a look at that…Atanu, Jabone IV, Lonania Prime, Hoth, Mupin XII? Mupin XII? Really? Did he make that one up? What
are
these places?
"
―Leia Organa and Han Solo
[
28
]
By the time of the
Galactic Civil War
between the
Galactic Empire
and the
Alliance to Restore the Republic
, Hoth was undergoing an
ice age
.
[
24
]
Various
smuggling rings
tried to make use of Hoth as a base, yet their efforts always failed due to the planet's extreme conditions.
[
29
]
Sometime following the
Battle of Yavin
,
Saponza's Gang
, itself a rebel cell, established a base on Hoth.
[
16
]
Hoth was first surveyed for use as a rebel base
[
29
]
by
Corporal
Purpruff
.
[
30
]
Jan Dodonna
, a
general
in the Alliance to Restore the Republic,
[
31
]
listed Hoth among his preliminary scans for possible Alliance bases.
[
28
]
With Hoth a world so obscure it was not on most star maps
[
32
]
despite being extremely close to the
Corellian Trade Spine
,
[
29
]
it looked to be a perfect spot for a rebel base.
[
32
]
Indeed, its surface was a winter wasteland, Hoth sat on a lesser used hyperlane,
[
29
]
and the asteroid field around Hoth provided an extra degree of protection.
[
33
]
That field hampered travel through the Hoth system, and any asteroid crash into the surface would create enough of a thermal signature that it hid signs of intelligent life.
[
29
]
In
1 ABY
,
[
34
]
with more resources at their command than the various smuggling rings that had failed to turn Hoth into a headquarters,
[
29
]
Hoth was chosen by the rebels as the location for their base of operations. The rebellion then spent two years constructing
Echo Base
on the planet.
[
32
]
With the Alliance's resources at their disposal, rebel
engineers
worked on expanding ice caverns into a base over those two years.
[
29
]
Around
2 ABY
,
[
35
]
after Dodonna was
killed
in the
Battle of Mako-Ta
,
[
31
]
Mon Mothma
gave his list of possible bases to
Leia Organa
after the
mission to Shu-Torun
, requesting that her
team
scout
the locations. Han Solo expressed surprise at how obscure the locations were. However, Luke Skywalker responded to him by saying that one of the locations was the Rebellion's new home.
[
28
]
Battle of Hoth and aftermath
[
]
"
My lord, the fleet has moved out of light-speed. Com-Scan has detected an energy field protecting an area of the sixth planet of the Hoth system. The field is strong enough to deflect any bombardment."
"The Rebels are alerted to our presence. Admiral Ozzel came out of light-speed too close to the system."
"He felt surprise was wiser—"
"He is as clumsy as he is stupid. A clean bombardment is now impossible. General, prepare your troops for a surface attack."
"Yes, my lord.
"
―General
Maximilian Veers
and Darth Vader
[

]
AT-ATs engage the rebel defense of Hoth.
Hoth was the arena of a
battle
between the Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance, which had installed its temporary headquarters, Echo Base, on the ice planet. However, thanks to
one
of the thousands of
probe droids
they had dispatched throughout
the galaxy
, the Imperials had discovered the Alliance base within a
month
of the Rebels' habitation on the planet.
[
36
]
Although Echo Base was evacuated in the eleventh hour, the Battle of Hoth resulted in a clear defeat for the Alliance after the elite Imperial
Blizzard Force
overran it.
[
7
]
[
10
]
In the months following the Battle of Hoth,
scavengers
established temporary base camps on the planet to scrap the
AT-ATs
destroyed by the Rebel Alliance during the Empire's attack. Following the
Battle of Endor
, Hoth became the site of another
battle
, occurring during the
Iron Blockade
imposed upon the
Anoat sector
.
[
37
]
New Republic Era
[
]
"
The planet's hostile conditions prevented settlements from taking root before or after the Alliance's time there, and Hoth returned to being all but ignored, remembered as a footnote in galactic history when it was recalled at all.
"
―The
Galactic Explorer's Guide
[
38
]
In
5 ABY
,
[
39
]
Troithe
Acting Governor
Fara Yadeez
heard rumors that the
New Republic
intended to repurpose Hoth into a
prison
for those who remained loyal to the Empire.
Major
Soran Keize
, however, dismissed the credibility of the rumor as Republic
Chancellor
Mon Mothma had been dedicated to a pretext of justice over punishment, and that repurposing Hoth, where the Rebellion had been badly defeated by the Empire, had too much poetry.
[
40
]
By the
New Republic Era
, Hoth returned to obscurity, the battlefields being picked apart and long-abandoned. It was mentioned in the
Galactic Explorer's Guide
, a survival guide written by
Hondo Ohnaka
and
DK-RA-43
, where it was described as a "footnote" in galactic history.
[
38
]
Behind the scenes
[
]
Concept art of Hoth by
Ralph McQuarrie
.
Hoth first appeared in the
1980
film
Star Wars
: Episode V
The Empire Strikes Back
, the second installment of the
Star Wars
original trilogy
.
[
10
]
The real-world filming location for Hoth was
Finse
,
Norway
.
[
41
]
The scenes of Luke Skywalker stumbling through the snow were filmed a few feet outside the crew's hotel.
[
42
]
Hoth appears in "
Reflections
," a short film with unconfirmed
canonicity
.
[
43
]
In between
25 ABY
and
34 ABY
,
[
44
]
the
First Order
had a presence on Hoth, but assignment to Hoth was considered a punishment. During that
time
, two
First Order stormtroopers
were reassigned to Hoth by an angered
Captain
Phasma
, who had overheard one of the
troopers
tell the
other
that whomever was in command of their prior facility should be reassigned to Hoth for their failings. Upon finding themselves on Hoth, the first trooper attempted to find comfort in finally blending into an environment, only for a wampa to roar in the distance.
