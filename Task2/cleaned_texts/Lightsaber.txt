An elegant weapon for a more civilized age.

―Obi-Wan Kenobi giving Luke Skywalker his father's lightsaber
[

]
The
lightsaber
, also referred to as a
laser sword
by those who were unfamiliar with it, was a weapon usually used by the
Jedi
,
Sith
, and other
Force-sensitives
. Lightsabers had a
plasma
blade
[
12
]
emitted from a usually metal
hilt
, and could be shut off at will or at the touch of a button. The hilt contained a
power cell
, like the
Diatium power cell
in
Darth Vader
's lightsaber.
[
16
]
It also contained a
kyber crystal
which had been attuned to the Force by a Jedi, and which amplified the energy from the power cell to create the plasma beam, as well as containing it within a blade-like field.
[
17
]
The energy blade had no mass, but lightsabers operated on principles of controlled electromagnetic arc-wave energy, creating a gyroscopic effect that made them challenging to handle.
[
16
]
It was a weapon that required skill and training, and was greatly enhanced when used in conjunction with
the Force
. Though also used by the Sith, the lightsaber was synonymous with the Jedi, with some in
the galaxy
believing only Jedi could use lightsabers.
Lightsabers were generally used for both
offense
and defense. A lightsaber could cut through virtually anything, from
flesh
to blast doors. The only ways to block the incoming attack of a lightsaber was with a
weapon made with material that conducted energy
, such as an
electrostaff
and a
Z6 riot control baton
, resistant metals like
beskar
and
cortosis
, or another lightsaber. When used defensively, a Force-sensitive could deflect
blaster
bolts with a lightsaber, and with skill, could even reflect the shots back toward the shooter or some other target. Experienced Jedi could even employ their lightsabers to absorb
Force lightning
. Most practitioners used one single-bladed lightsaber, though some used
double-bladed lightsabers
or even multiple lightsabers at once. Despite lacking Force-sensitivity, the
cyborg
General
Grievous
was capable of wielding four lightsabers at once thanks to his advanced mechanical body and enhanced
cybernetic
brain
.
Lightsaber combat was divided into seven Forms:
Form I
,
Form II
,
Form III
,
Form IV
,
Form V
,
Form VI
, and
Form VII
.

I don't get to treat many lightsaber wounds. It's such an old weapon. People today prefer to fight with rifles and blasters, from long range.

lightsabers were used thousands of years before the
age of the Galactic Republic
, seeing use in the
Great Scourge
of
Malachor
.
[
20
]
They were also used in the
Battles of Rashfond
and the
Peacekeeping of Parliock
,
[

The
proto-saber
was an ancient type of prototype lightsaber.
[
21
]
Republic Era
[
]
Members of the Jedi Order wielded lightsabers in the name of protecting life and the light side.
During the history of the Jedi Order, the lightsaber was considered to be the Jedi's only true ally in battle.
[
1
]
As Master Obi-Wan Kenobi once declared to his Padawan Anakin Skywalker in the days of the late Republic, the lightsaber was a Jedi's life.
[
22
]
Jedi saw the lightsaber as a symbol of the care that they would wield using their gifts given by the Force, and also served as a message to their opponents: mastering the lightsaber required great skill and training. The choice of the saber was also the symbol of their role and duty as protectors, not destroyers, and the fact that the Jedi did not seek power and only sought to stand tall against darkness.
[
23
]
Still, Jedi knew they would need to be more than their lightsabers.
[
24
]
When
Padawan
Enya Keen
lost her lightsaber during a
mission to Dalna
, her master,
Char-Ryl-Roy
, reminded her that she would need to act as a Jedi without the weapon. While finding a kyber crystal was still a sacred part of a Jedi's duty and Keen felt like losing her lightsaber would feel like losing part of herself, she willingly gave away the crystal if it meant finding more about the
Path of the Open Hand
and its plans.

[
25
]
Lightsabers took on a more prominent role in galactic affairs as the
Clone Wars
came to pass. Jedi, previously peacekeepers, became
Jedi Generals
of the
Grand Army of the Republic
, and thus began using their lightsabers more often than they had in their role of peacekeeping.

Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi readies his lightsaber for his final duel against his former disciple, Darth Vader.
For the majority of the Empire's reign, the only lightsabers that were prominently used were those of
Darth Vader
and the
Inquisitors
who served him.
[
20
]
All the same, there were still lightsabers used by Jedi survivors and those they trained, like
Obi-Wan Kenobi
,
Luke Skywalker
,
[

Ahsoka Tano
,
Kanan Jarrus
, and
Ezra Bridger

Rey and Kylo Ren, a dyad in the Force, both use lightsabers in combat.
After the Empire was defeated, Luke began training a new generation of Jedi.
[

Tano adopted the
Mandalorian
Sabine Wren
as her Padawan, with Wren taking on
Bridger's lightsaber as her own
.
[

In the wake of the
conflict on Peridea
, both ended up stranded in the
far galaxy
as
Grand Admiral
Mitth'raw'nuruodo
"Thrawn" had returned. Bridger, with a
new lightsaber
in his possession, did manage to return to the galaxy as well, however.
[
32
]
Skywalker's new generation of Jedi were killed in the
destruction of his Jedi temple
, once again leading to a time where the only prominent lightsaber user was a
dark sider
,
Kylo Ren
. That all changed when a scavenger, Rey, discovered the
Skywalker lightsaber
[
15
]
and ultimately came to train under Luke Skywalker and his twin sister Leia Organa to combat Kylo Ren and the First Order during a war against the Imperial successors.
[
33
]
After the war, Rey ritually buried her masters'
lightsabers
at the
Lars Homestead
on Luke's home planet, Tatooine, to end the Skywalker family's suffering. She ignited
her newly crafted lightsaber
to show her complete journey as a Jedi, and, to honor the Skywalkers' legacy, she took the Skywalker name as her surname after receiving the blessing from the
Force spirits
of her masters when she was asked by a local.

Mechanics and specifications
[
]
Components
[
]
"
A lightsaber has five main parts. The power cell, the casing, the focusing lens, the emitter and, of course, the
crystal
. The rest is just wiring, an on/off switch, and whatever fancy extra bits people want to build in. All in all though, it's a pretty simple device.
"
―Doctor
Cuata
[
35
]
The inner workings of Kylo Ren's lightsaber
A lightsaber drew power from an appropriately-sized power cell.
[
36
]
Parts that would work to make a lightsaber include modulation circuits and an energy gate. Ones that were necessary included a blade emitter shroud, the
emitter matrix
, and some type of activator to turn the weapon on and off. Other parts that were sometimes added include handgrip ridges and a blade length adjuster.
[
36
]
[
12
]
Some lightsabers also featured a non-lethal low-power setting used for training.
[
37
]
Single-bladed lightsabers usually had a belt ring so they could be hung from a belt hook, or a wheel-shaped attachment that slotted into a matching belt clip on the owner's belt when not in use.
[
38
]
[
5
]
[
39
]
[
40
]
[
36
]
Specially designed lightsabers could even use unstable
crystals
, such as
Kylo Ren's lightsaber
, which featured two laterally facing vents designed to divert excess energy away from the cracked crystal and keep the lightsaber stable. This also had the effect of creating a protective
crossguard
.
[
41
]
During assembly, it was important to not accidentally invert the emitter matrix; when activated the lightsabers' power grid would backfire. At best this could cause the blade to quickly short out, but if it was left on, the faulty weapon would violently explode, potentially killing those in close proximity.

"
―Luke Skywalker describes a lightsaber
[
42
]
Lightsaber hilts were made up of multiple parts that enveloped and protected the internal components. Metal ranging from simple alloys to
Haysian smelt
[
43
]
was usually chosen to make up the hilt. However, other materials were also chosen by lightsaber users, such as the
Jedi youngling
Gungi
, who made use of a
lightsaber
with a casing carved from the wood of a
Brylark tree
, whose wood was as strong as metal.
[
1
]
Some hilts were even crafted with gems.
[
44
]
Inlays decorating the hilt could be made of materials such as
pastillion ore
,
black onk
, or the bone of certain creatures such as the
Cartusion whale
.
[
1
]
Each piece of the hilt was aesthetically tailored towards one of multiple different design philosophies, which both informed and were informed by the maker's choice of materials, ideology, and personal preferences.
[
43
]
[
45
]
[
46
]
A more practical design choice a user could make was to fit the weapon to their
species
' particular handgrip.
[
47
]
Various types of lightsabers were in use during the
High Republic Era
.
The Jedi Order of the
late Galactic Republic
made use of four styles:
Duty and Resolve
,
Peace and Justice
,
Elemental Nature
, and
Valor and Wisdom
.
[
43
]
[
45
]
The former two were simple designs intended to reflect the Jedi commitment to a life of devotion to the Force and the Order's ideals.
[
48
]
[
49
]
The latter two made use of resilient natural materials derived from flora and fauna to evoke the living Force.
[
48
]
[
49
]
The Sith Order made use of two styles:
Passion and Strength
, and
Power and Control
.
[
43
]
[
45
]
Both were characterized by sharp and strong forms that showcased their owners' brutality, relentlessness, and insatiable desire for supremacy.
[
48
]
[
49
]
Another style,
Protection and Defense
, was favored by the earliest Force users in ancient times. It featured designs and inscriptions with meanings that have become shrouded in mystery, but the style itself was believed to have been created with the intent of conferring anonymity upon and symbolizing the emotional detachment of the wielder, who would use their lightsaber strictly for personal protection.

Cutting power
[
]
"
It's heavier than I thought."
"Energy constantly flows through the crystal. You're not fighting with a simple blade as much as you are directing a current of power.
"
―

and
Kanan Jarrus

Darksaber

]
Qui-Gon Jinn
using his lightsaber to cut through one of the
Saak'ak
's
blast doors
The power of the energy blade was so great that it could cut through almost anything. One important note about lightsaber wounds was that they rarely bled profusely, even when a limb had been
severed
.
[
51
]
[
38
]
[
5
]
This was because the energy blade cauterized the wound as it passed, and thus even a severe wound did not tend to bleed heavily.
[
39
]
Lightsaber-resistant materials
[
]
Aside from the blade of another lightsaber, there were rare materials that could withstand a lightsaber blade:
Armorweave
are material used on various pieces of
clothing
, including
capes
, as
armor
. It was also capable of resisting a lightsaber strikes. The
Jedi Temple Guard
had special
armor robes
incorporated layers of armorweave to provide them with an effective defense against blaster bolts and lightsabers.
[
52
]
Pure beskar could repel lightsaber strikes for a period of time.
Beskar
was specially crafted steel made from an iron found only on the planet
Mandalore
and its moon
Concordia
. It could repel lightsaber strikes
[
53
]
for a brief time in its purest form.
[
54
]
Examples of its use in that way included
Din Djarin
's
armor
, which resisted
Ahsoka Tano's lightsaber
blades, or the
beskar spear
offered to Din Djarin by
Morgan Elsbeth
, the magistrate of
Calodan
, which was also used to fight against
Tano's
sabers.
[
55
]
The
Praetorian Guard
armor was able to resist lightsaber strikes, with the gauntlets being capable of parrying one directly. However, a direct thrust or stab could still penetrate the armor. Their high-tech weapons are also resistant to lightsaber strikes.
[
33
]
Cortosis
armor, made by specially weaving cortosis fibers within a protective matrix, was able to redirect a lightsaber's energy into itself which would cause the lightsaber's blade to temporarily shut off upon contact with the armor.
[
56
]
Magical ichor
weapons like
Mother
Talzin's sword
is able to resist lightsaber strikes.
[
57
]
A
personal energy shield
powered by extremely rare
kohlen crystals
was impervious to kyber crystal lightsabers. However, swapping out a lightsabers' kyber crystal for a kohlen crystal would produce a low-powered
orange
blade which was capable of slicing through the shields.
[
58
]
The rare metal
phrik
is impervious to lightsaber blades. A staff made of this material was once on display during the
Valo Republic Fair
, which was taken and used by the
Nihil
Tempest Runner
Lourna Dee
to fend off the Jedi Archivist
OrbaLin
.
[
59
]
Electrostaffs
are made of phrik,
[
16

making them resistant,
[
60
]
but not invulnerable, to lightsabers.

Construction
[
]
Components
[
]
A Twi'lek Jedi using the Force to assemble a lightsaber out of several components
A lightsaber was built up from several different components:
blade emitter
,
focusing lens
,
cycling field energizers
, main hilt, kyber crystal, lightsaber energy core, hand grip, inert power insulator, and the pommel cap. All of these components were incredibly important to keeping the lightsaber fixed together and allowed a Jedi to fight without it falling apart and stopped the saber from exploding upon activation. Every lightsaber's hilt was customised to the individual Jedi's needs and preferences, but no matter the appearance, each weapon contained the same basic element - Power Insulators, cycling field energizers, energy modulation circuits, a focusing lens, a blade emitter and most important the energy core which contains a kyber crystal. Once a few control dials were added, which would have been responsible for changing the intensity and length of the blade, the lightsaber would be complete.
[
68
]
Kyber crystals
[
]
"
The heart of the lightsaber, the kyber crystal is, focuses the force from the Jedi, it does.
"
―Yoda
[
69
]
A kyber crystal
Kyber crystals were incredibly rare items capable of focusing and amplifying energy. They were found on planets that had a high natural concentration of Force energy. The main planets in which they were found were
Ilum
and
Jedha
, however Ilum was more commonly used as it was the planet in which
the Gathering
took place, where the Jedi
younglings
went to actually construct a lightsaber. Each kyber crystal was unique and required a Force-sensitive individual to align and activate it during the lightsaber assembly process. Once found, a kyber crystal would have originally been clear, but once it was awakened by the Force, its color would shift to match the nature of the saber's master. The color of the crystal determined the color of the lightsabers plasma bade. Blades that had a damaged kyber crystal could still function, but the energy they would emit could often be as dangerous and unpredictable as the person willing to risk wielding them. Some individuals such as Kylo Ren wielded these unstable crystals, usually with modifications to accommodate the unstable kyber.
[
68
]
Construction process
[
]
The construction of a lightsaber began on the planet of Ilum. In a very specific time in the planet's solar cycle, a small group of Jedi younglings would begin the 1000 year old ritual known as the Gathering, escorted by a Jedi Knight. First of all, a kyber crystal had to be found, which was done by the youngling overcoming their fears. Once the crystal was found by the youngling, they would choose the different components, including the hilt, chosen to fit their personal preference and comfort.
[
69
]
Next, the youngling would activate their kyber crystal and begin to construct their lightsaber. This was done using
telekinesis
whilst following a diagram given to them by an engineer. Once completed, the lightsaber would have been ready to ignite. As well as this, the younglings then had the knowledge to construct a lightsaber in the future should their current one be destroyed.
[
70
]
Variations
[
]
The sheer number of Jedi active during the days of the
Galactic Republic
naturally resulted in countless variations in the designs of lightsabers. Some of these modifications were merely for the exterior looks of the saber, while others enhanced the sabers functionality in unique ways. While the traditional single bladed lightsaber was the design most Jedi used, some preferred creative adaptation of this classic weapon.
[
68

[
75
]
There also existed a type of blaster known as a
lightsaber rifle
which was designed to be combined with a lightsaber. To work, the user would insert a standard lightsaber into a slot on top of the rifle. Once loaded, the weapon could fire powerful beams of energy that were highly destructive.
[
79

Usage and application
[

Purpose
[
]
"
We do not want to be powerful. We wish to stand tall against the dark. Our tools reflect that goal. Especially our chosen weapon. We all wield the same one, with minor variations. The lightsaber. We could make kyber bombs or blasters… Indeed, it's been tried. There are a few weapons like that in the sealed archives. But anyone can fire a blaster. Very few can safely and skillfully wield a lightsaber. Everyone in the galaxy knows this to be true. We want our opponents to know that we use a weapon that requires intention. Training, precision and choice. The lightsaber symbolizes the care with which we approach our gifts through the Force and the care with which we wield them. It reminds others that while we could do more… We very purposefully do not. Take it, my Padawan. We choose a weapon with limitations—with difficulties. You cannot use a lightsaber to destroy a city or a planet. Every death or injury it inflicts must be precisely chosen. The lightsaber tells the galaxy that the Jedi are not destroyers. We are protectors.
"
―Obi-Wan Kenobi, to Anakin Skywalker
[
81
]
The Jedi used their lightsabers to bring an end to conflicts.
The intended purpose of the lightsaber was to bring an end to conflicts, being designed to injure no more than its wielder chose. Additionally, there was no collateral damage from lightsaber strikes
[
19
]
unless the blade happened to hit a target on accident.
[
82
]
If death was deemed necessary, the blade was designed to kill quickly. Even though the Jedi held themselves to these rules,
[
19
]
the groups like the Sith chose to use their lightsabers in ways that caused suffering.
[
83
]
Jedi Padawan
Bell Zettifar
felt that the lightsaber was designed to give an enemy a chance to surrender, as its trademark glow and hum made it easy to spot and hear. Furthermore, he believed the blade's sound was one of training, focus, and skill; it was the sound of a Jedi's last resort and was the art of their Order.
[
19
]
Although Sith were also known to wield lightsabers, they viewed the dark side of the Force as their primary weapon, with the saber serving as a symbol of the dark side and the way it consumed all who opposed it.

was the preferred fighting method used by lightsaber wielders. Throughout the millennia, many combat styles were refined into the seven "classic" forms that serve as the standard,
[
76
]
and numerous other fighting methods that call for advanced levels of skill. Lightsabers were most often held with both hands during combat.

Lightsabers were an integral part of the
knighting ceremonies
of the Jedi Order.
[

]
During the ceremony, a Padawan would have their Padawan braid ritualistically severed by the presiding Jedi Master.
[
86

Kyber crystals were collected from a Jedi's lightsaber if they fell in battle. Many of these crystals were then formed into the
Kyber Arch
, which became a site for meditation in the Jedi Temple.

Behind the scenes
[
]
Early concepts
[
]
"
The original concept was that the Jedi would fight with swords, and I wanted to make it a sort of laser sword, to give it that technology edge
"
―George Lucas on the early development of the lightsaber
[
8
]
Early concept art of lightsabers
The usage of the lightsaber was originally inspired by many of the serials that
George Lucas
watched and enjoyed as a child, which featured many characters wielding swords. When he began conceiving
Star Wars
, he wished to include swords, creating the "lightsaber" to allow them to better mesh with the futuristic setting.
[
88
]
In the early incarnations of the
Star Wars
storyline, lightsabers were not exclusive to the Jedi and other Force-users, but were in fact very mundane. Early concept art depicts lightsabers being wielded by Rebel and Imperial soldiers alike. George Lucas later limited the lightsabers to exclusively the Jedi in order to make them feel more unusual, and heighten the mystique of the Jedi.
[
89
]
Also, in the
rough draft
of the script, lightsabers were referred to as "lazerswords."
[
90
]
Crystals first appear in
Star Wars
simply as an embedded decoration on the hilt in the original film's
novelization
. Aside from this single instance, there are no crystals mentioned in any of the movies or their novelizations.
[
91
]
Prop design and effects
[
]
"
Some sounds, like the lightsaber—fashioned from an old movie projector motor hum and a TV picture tube buzz—came immediately to mind when I first read the script for
Star Wars
and saw the concept artwork.
"
―
Ben Burtt
, sound designer
[

A Graflex flash similar to the one used for Luke Skywalker's first lightsaber
During the filming of
A New Hope
, the
Anakin/Luke lightsaber
was made from a Graflex camera side-attach flash, while
Darth Vader's lightsaber
was made from a Micro Precision Products flash attachment. The handle grips were made with T-shaped pieces of plastic from sliding glass cabinet windows and, contrary to popular belief, were not made with rubber windshield wipers. D-rings were attached to the bottoms of the units so that they could be worn on belts.
Obi-Wan Kenobi's lightsaber
was the most complex hilt at the time. It was assembled from parts of an Armitage Shanks Starlite model Handwheel, Browning ANM2 machine gun booster, WWI No.3 Mk.1 British Rifle Grenade and a Rolls-Royce Derwent Mk.8/Mk.9 Jet Engine Balance Pipe.
[
93

Korean animator
Nelson Shin
, who was working for DePatie–Freleng Enterprises at the time, was asked by his manager if he could animate the lightsaber in the live action scenes of a film. After Shin accepted the assignment, the live action footage was given to him. He drew the lightsabers with a rotoscope, an animation which was superimposed onto the footage of the physical lightsaber blade prop. Shin explained to the people from Lucasfilm that since a lightsaber is made of light, the sword should look "a little shaky" like a fluorescent tube. He suggested inserting one frame that was much lighter than the others while printing the film on an optical printer, making the light seem to vibrate. Shin also recommended adding a degausser sound on top of the other sounds for the weapon since the sound would be reminiscent of a magnetic field. The whole process took one week, surprising his company. Lucasfilm showed Shin the finished product, having followed his suggestions to use an X-Acto knife to give the lightsaber a very sharp look, and to have sound accompany the weapon's movements.
[
95
]
The lightsaber effects during the
original trilogy
started out in a very complicated manner. During the filming of
A New Hope
, the blade was made of a three-sided rod covered with reflective material. The rod was then rapidly spun by a compact motor in the hilt, reflecting the lights on set and creating an in-camera glowing effect. However, these props were highly limited; they were cumbersome and fragile, often breaking during fight scenes. Also, the glowing effect was not absolute, as whenever the blade moved out of the light or pointed more directly at the camera the glow disappeared and the actual spinning rod could be seen. In order to partially compensate for this loss of the effect, the blade was rotoscoped and an animated glow was added by tracing onto a blown-up copy of the frame with pen and colored ink, one frame at a time. It was at this phase that blades were given colors, as the props were simple white rods.

88
]
[
89
]
Mark Hamill
and
Bob Anderson
duel with carbon rods.
During the filming of
The Empire Strikes Back
, it was decided creating an in-camera glowing effect was more trouble than it was worth, so the spinning rods were swapped for carbon rods. While these new blades were less cumbersome than before, they were still very fragile and frequently broke. However, they continued to be used for
Return of the Jedi
.
[
88
]
When filming began for
The Phantom Menace
, the new lightsaber blades were steel and aluminum rods, which were highly durable, but frequently bent and flexed, requiring constant replacement.
[
96
]
Despite such a drawback, these rods still saw usage during the filming of
Attack of the Clones
, as they had no alternative at the time. However, for the filming of
Revenge of the Sith
, the blades were replaced by carbon fiber rods laminated with glass and plastic. These new props were highly durable and didn't flex, though they were extremely hard, often causing bruising and leaving scars. While lightsaber effects were still done by rotoscoping for the
prequels
, they were done digitally, rather than by hand.
[
89
]
For
The Force Awakens
, the lightsaber props glowed, using a similar effect used in
Attack of the Clones
during the fight between Anakin Skywalker and Count Dooku. In behind the scenes footage, it was revealed that the actors were using blades similar to the ones made by
Master Replicas
. This not only added to the environmental realism that was desired by providing interactive lighting on the actors and the set, but also immersed the actors in the lightsaber experience, building on the performance and convincing nature of the lightsaber effect.
[
97
]
Colors
[
]
Lightsabers depicted in the first two released films,
A New Hope
and
The Empire Strikes Back
, had blades that were colored either blue (for the Jedi) or red (for the Sith). This color difference was a decision during post-production when the lightsaber blades were being rotoscoped, as the original blades were simply white.
[
88
]
In
Return of the Jedi
, Luke's
newly-constructed lightsaber
was colored blue during the initial editing of the film, and appears so in both an early movie trailer and the official theatrical posters, but in the final film, it was ultimately colored green in order to better stand out against the blue sky of Tatooine in outdoor scenes and to make it more obvious to the audience that the new lightsaber was different from Luke's one in
The Empire Strikes Back
.
[
98
]
It also appeared as green in re-release posters.
[
99
]
Lightsaber blades with green, white, and blue colors appear together in live action via
Ahsoka
.
Both green and blue became standard blade colors for Jedi lightsabers in the
Star Wars
prequel trilogy. In the same regard, red became the standard Sith lightsaber blade.
Mace Windu
's
purple lightsaber
, as first seen in
Attack of the Clones
, was a personal request from actor
Samuel L. Jackson
as a way to make his character stand out among other Jedi.
[
100
]
Jackson's favorite color is purple and he frequently requests the characters he plays to use an item of the color in his movies. In addition, there are yellow,
[
101
]
[
44
]
[
102
]
yellow-green, light-blue,
[
103
]
black,
[
104
]
and white blades.
[
105
]
Such blades can visibly see seen in works like
The Clone Wars
and
Rebels
animated series.
[
104
]
The yellow lightsaber blade made its live-action debut in the final scene of
The Rise of Skywalker
, as the
new weapon
constructed by
Rey Skywalker
.
[
34
]
Orange blades appear in the video game
Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order
, as did indigo, cyan, and magenta blades.
[
43
]
At the direction of
Dave Filoni
, orange-red lightsabers appeared in the form of Shin Hati and Baylan Skoll's lightsaber blades in
Ahsoka
. To Filoni, the color signals to the audience that Hati and Skoll are not characters who fulfill the same narrative role as the Sith.
[
106
]
As established by the novel
Master & Apprentice
, a lightsaber with a
kohlen crystal
inside also produced an orange blade, but with an intensity that made it mostly useless against anything other than a specialized type of shield which was also powered by a kohlen crystal.
[
58
]
Choreography
[
]
Ray Park
practices dueling with the stunt doubles of
Liam Neeson
and
Ewan McGregor
.
While the usage of lightsabers was originally inspired by rapiers featured in the old serials George Lucas enjoyed, the final choreography in
A New Hope
looked nothing like fencing. As Jedi and their Sith counterparts were heavily inspired by
samurai
, the fighting styles utilized were based more on
kendo
.
[
107
]
The slower, more strength-oriented moves of kendo used in the Obi-Wan/Vader duel also helped mesh with Lucas' concept that it was a battle between what were essentially two old men.
[
88
]
During the filming of
The Empire Strikes Back
, Lucas began ramping up the speed of the duels, making them "faster and more intense," the idea being that Luke Skywalker was becoming increasingly proficient with the weapon.
[
88
]
Also, rather than utilize
David Prowse
, the actor within the Darth Vader costume, for the duels, they instead had professional swordsman Bob Anderson perform the fights, due to Prowse's tendency to repeatedly break the fragile prop blades. Anderson continued to serve as Prowse's fighting double during the filming of
Return of the Jedi
.
When filming began for
The Phantom Menace
, the new stunt coordinator
Nick Gillard
ramped up the speed and agility the characters demonstrated in lightsaber duels, the idea being that the prequels took place when the Jedi Order was in "full flower," at least in terms of combat techniques.
[
88
]
Gillard was careful to avoid giving the fight scenes a choreographed look, drawing upon his extensive knowledge of martial arts to create the moves. The end result was a very fast-paced style of fighting, which he described as being like a chess game between grand masters, with every move being a check. This style of choreography was continued on throughout the prequel trilogy.
[
108
]
Ewan McGregor practices lightsaber combat with Nick Gillard.
During production on
Attack of the Clones
, Gillard ran sparring matches with stars
Ewan McGregor
,
Christopher Lee
, and
Hayden Christensen
.
[
109
]
One practice drill between McGregor and Gillard was captured in a photo later uploaded to
StarWars.com
under the name "Spar Wars."
[
110
]
It was during some of Gillard's training sessions with the actors that he was approached by animation director
Rob Coleman
for helping in figuring out Yoda's fighting style: in the script Coleman was given, all it said about Yoda and Dooku's duel was that it would "[defy] description." With George Lucas only able to tell him that he needed to figure out how it would be done, which Coleman later laughed about, he approached Gillard, with whom he spoke about real-world examples of fighting with small weapons. Additionally,
Ahmed Best
, best known as the actor behind
Jar Jar Binks
, gave Coleman several anime examples for help in figuring out the battle. Ultimately, he figured out Yoda's speed and style upon watching a scene in the film
Swordsman II
.
[
109
]
Yoda pulling back his cloak to retrieve his lightsaber came at Lucas's request as it called to mind images of a gunslinger retrieving their pistol. Lucas and Coleman were both very happy with the finalized duel between Yoda and Dooku, with Lucas in specific approving of the way Yoda jumped around because it was what he wanted. Coleman was nervous such actions would be seen as "too cartoony." When the screening he attended lit up with excitement at Yoda's fighting style, Coleman was relieved.

Although six generalized styles (four for the Jedi and two for the Sith) are identified in
Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order
and
Savi's Workshop
uses lightsaber parts from all six, Savi's condensed them into three styles (two for the Jedi and one for the Sith). Duty and Resolve was merged into Peace and Justice; Valor and Wisdom was merged into Elemental Nature; Passion and Strength was merged into Power and Control. The Protection and Defense style does not appear in
Fallen Order
